Skornia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\n* ft\n?/*,\n2& u\n\">1*0,11\n1358\n'i*?ll\nThough the proposed Smather Bill would not affect the State\nUniversity of Iowa at this moment, it could create a great problem\nin the future. We do not now have a University Press but are quite\nhopeful of getting one in the not-too-distant future. When we do,\none of its major projects will be the publication of original\nsymphonies and other musical works.\nAs you might know, one of the outstanding areas at the Univer¬\nsity of Iowa is its Department of Music. One of this department's\nmost inportant activities is composition. These compositions are\neven accepted as dissertations at the PhD level. We would hope\nthat our University Press would be able to publish those compositions\nof students and of faculty members which are worthy of distribution\nand which no other publishing house would find profitable.\nWe would not like to jeopardize the future of our present broad¬\ncasting facilities nor those which we propose. Nor, on the other\nhand, would we like to see this important creative musical activity\nstifled. For these reasons, Harry, I hope that the NAEB will do\neverything possible to see that if the Smathers Bill is enacted,\nit will exempt educational institutions from its provisions.\nSincerely,\nSam L. Becker\nS Director, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLBrmw"
