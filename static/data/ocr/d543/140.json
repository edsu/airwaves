Harley\nWHA\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nMadison 6, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nJust so that you*11 know my troubles-you don't\nhave any-I'm advising my NAEB Board meeting plans, in\ncase it makes any difference.\nI'm driving to Columbus with Skornia and Hill,\nand will arrive late Monday afternoon, May 4. I leave via\nair Tuesday afternoon at 3:20 p.m. That means I'll be\nthere for Monday night and Tuesday morning Board meetings,\nbut not for Tuesday afternoon.\nSorry, I can't stay for all, but I'll try to make\nmy contributions, if any, succinctly. You see, I must be\nback here Tuesday night for meeting of the Champaign City\nCouncil, being duly elected to a position on that august\nbody at a recent election.\nFES:fmh\ncc: H. J. Skornia"
