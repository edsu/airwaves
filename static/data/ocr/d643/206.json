  "text": "-4-\nIn setting the time for the next Board meeting, there is also\nthe question of our personal availability during the summer. I,\nfor example, am leaving on June 14 to drive to California, and\nshall spend the period from June 23 through August 1 teaching at\nthe University of Southern California, I shall leave Los Angeles\non August 2, and expect to return to the office in Minneapolis on\nAugust 11, In view of the distances involved, and of my five-day-\na-week class schedule (compared to the central location of\nMinneapolis and the relative schedule freedom of a department\nhead with administrative duties but no class assignments), it Is\nunlikely that I could attend any meetings of the Board of Directors\nfrom now until about the third week in August, This, of course.\nIs not to say that no meetings can be held without meâ€”the vice\npresident can preside in my absence, and I am sure would do a very\ngood Job, My point Is only that some of you too may have summer\nconflicts.\nAnyway, we can better settle our meeting plans after a further\nreport from our Foundation Committee chairman.\nBP*ds\nEnc,: Newspaper articles on Washington meeting\nP, S, John Schwarzwalder is making a satisfactory recovery from\nhis heart attack. I met his wife a couple of days ago, and found\nher in good spirits over the outlook. He will be leaving the\nhospital soon, after which he will spend at least several weeks\nconvalescing at home before returning to the office."
