It is significant that the Class HI\nstations, alone, which are the Community and State Systems, generally aHocate\nthis function to an employee with the status of Public Relations Director*\nPerhaps the fact that all of these stations have perfected their organizations\nwithin more recent times than the others has enabled them to set up from\nscratch an organization more in keeping with current business practices.\nTABLE III\n? _\nDELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EDITING OF PROGRAM SCHEDULES\n(In terms of number of respondents reporting)\nStaff Position\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nStation Director or Manager\n6\n6\n0\n0\nProgram Director or Assistant\n9\n7\n2\n0\nAssistant Director\n2\n1\n0\n0\nJoint effort of several staff members (2 or more)\n6\n3\n3\n1\nPublic Relations, promotion, or publicity person\n3\n1\n5\n1\nNews Director\n2\n0\n0\n0\nStudent Staff Member\n2\nl\n0\n0\nEmployee of Board of Education\n0\nl\n0\n0\nTraffic Director\n2\n0\n0\n0\nSupervising Secretary\n1\n0\nG\n0\nFaculty Moderator\n1\n0\n0\n0\nScript Writer\n1\n0\n0\n0\nClass of Stations\nA few of the positions contained in the above table are filled by\nstudents, but were not included in the \"Student Staff Member\" category\nmore specific titles were supplied.\nif"
