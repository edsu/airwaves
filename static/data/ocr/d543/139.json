This is the first I'd heard, though I was\nsure you'd win.\nAnd you'll make a damn good councilman too! After all,\nanyone who can cope with the tangled affairs of NAEB with\nsuch conspicuous success for 25 years or whatever should have\nno trouble handling municipal muddles.\nYour early departure is regrettable, sir, but is\ngraciously granted.\nSee you at the Deshler!\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley"
