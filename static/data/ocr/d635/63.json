I\nknow that I was very much Impressed, and I ascertain that those\nmembers of the Board who have not yet been exposed to this display\nof headquarters efficiency might well be indoctrinated with\nsalubrious results.\nSince I will not be at Columbus, the entire operation\nwill be under the jurisdiction, charge and control of Graydon.\nBy copy of this letter, he is asked to ratify this request, or\nto indicate to you that he does not consider it necessary.\nWith befct wishes.\nCordially,\nSeymour If.
