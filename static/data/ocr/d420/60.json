C.\nDear Bill:\nThe Western Radio and Television Conference is\nscheduled to meet in San Francisco February 22,\n23 and 24, 1962.\nKen Kager and I have scheduled a regional NAEB\nmeeting, for the members of RegiotfVI during the\nperiod 2:00 to 5:00pm Thursday, February 22nd.\nThis will, in effect, be the opening, or pre-opening\nsession of the WRTC meeting, as the official\nopening starts with an evening session, I believe.\nWe would very much like to have you attend the NAEB\nregional meeting and give the members a run-down,\nas you did last year at Salt Lake City, on current\nactivities and developments in NAEB.\nI presume because of the San Francisco convention a\nyear ago we have more than a normal interest still\nexisting among Westerners for NAEB. We would like\nto nourish this interest, particularly among those\nwho are unable to travel East for most of the NAEB\nconventions.\nI know you will find the rest of the WRTC meeting of\ninterest -- the NETRC Affiliates Committee will be\nmeeting with Jack and Jim, concurrently, as well.\nLet us know, -vhen convenient, if you can work this\nmeeting into your schedule.\nLoren B.
