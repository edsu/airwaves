At a recent\nmeeting of the Engineering Committee a request was made that something be done to improve\nthe tapes used on the Network, and the Engineering Committee as a whole requested the\nNetwork to study the situation and take some actiono\nYou will recall that in the past the Network has urged its members to return tapes of good\nquality; these urgings, unfortunately, fell on some deaf ears and all the members suffered\nbecause of this® Therefore, it has become evident that mere urgings are not enough®\nSinco the major duty of the Network staff is to provide for the common good of all the sta¬\ntions, the following policies have been drafted and will be put into operation effective\nJanuary 1, 1957o These policies have been formulated after considerable discussion invol¬\nving both members of the general Headquarters staff and the Network staff, in consultation\nvith the Engineering Committee and the Radio Network Committee® We feel that these are\nprudent measures and that their initiation will greatly assist our constant efforts to make\nthe Network a sound operation, both quality-wise and financially®\n1® After January 1, 1957 any station wishing to retain Network tapes permanently must\nreplace those tapes with new tapes (Scotch 111A or equivalent); stations not providing\nreplacements within the time specifiec below will, after sufficient warning, be billed\nfor the missing tapes at the rate of $3®00 per 1200 foot reel®\n2® All Network tapes wot retained under the above conditions areto 'be returned to the\nNetwork as soon as possible after their broadcast, but in no case later than six (6)\nmonths after their release date announced in the program offerings, except in the case\nof in-school tapes, which are discussed below®\n3® Realizing that tapes forming in-school series are distributed months ahead of their\nactual airing, the Network asks that such tapes be returned by the July 1 foil owing the\nclose of the school year for which they were distributed® Should any station wish to\nretain permanently any in-school tape(sthese tape(s) must be replaced as described in\nParagraph 1 above®\n4® All Network tapes should be returned in the boxes in which they were sent. Any\nNetwork tape found by any station to be of inferior quality and thus unsuitable for\nfurther use should be marked with an NAEB UNUSABLE sticker distributed previously®\n(Additional stickers are available from Headquarters upon request.)\n5. The Network staff will check each incoming tape, and any tape not meeting Network\nstandards will be discarded. In the event that a poor tape is discovered which does\nnot contain a Network program, as copied at the Network, the station sending that tape\nwill be requested to replace that tape with either a) the original tape, b) a new tape,\nor c) $3*00®\n6® Any station wishing to retain tape3 under the conditions of Paragraph 1 should so\nnotify the Network in writing as soon as possible after this decision is made®"
