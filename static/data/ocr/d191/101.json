Kendall Crane\nDirector, WDUQ,\nDuquesne University\nPittsburgh 19, Pennsylvania\nDear Ken:\nYour suggestion might work if we\nhad enough business. With the present number\nof stations we might have difficulty in handling\nthe various exceptions. In the long run this Is\nthe type of service I wish we could offer member\nstations. For example, I wish we could offer\n20 hours and let them take 10 or 12, but our\nability to operate within the funds depends\non keeping most everything in gear. I thank\nyou for getting the load off your chest and maybe\nwe can evaluate it along with other suggestions\nwhen we know how things go this year.\nWith kind personal regards.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFES:fmh"
