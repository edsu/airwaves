Its own organization is loose-knit, held\ntogether by a common bond of interest.\nFor 15 years now the Conference has been held in various cities of the West,\ngrowing steadily in size and subject matter as the vital field it covers grows in size\nand importance.\nThe Conference is your annual opportunity to meet with the men and women who\nare doing things in the area of broadcasting and education, to share experiences\nand learn together, as the Conference searches for answers to the problems\njust ahead."
