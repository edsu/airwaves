With the help of the television* the class¬\nroom teacher is now more completely\nthe manager of the learning situation.\n2. The classroom teacher* who best\nknows his group and the individuals\nIn the group* must determine which\nconcepts of the television lesson\nshould be supplemented* impressed*\nand fortified.\n3. Television frees the classroom teacher\nto work more closely with students* to\ndiscover their weaknesses and strengths.\nWhile the television teacher is making\nthe presentation* the classroom teacher\nhas more time to observe* assist etc.\nIt is a hard fact that we cannot be in\nthe play and in the audience at the\nsame time."
