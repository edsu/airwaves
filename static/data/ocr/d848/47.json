His attitude towards the television lesson\ndetermines the attitudes of the students.\nH. He needs to set the example for response,\nand other activities suggested by the\nthe television teacher.\nc. He should not just sit down in the back of\nthe class. He should move about, observing,\nhelping, suggesting, etc.\nd. He may even use such devices as placing\nthose who need the most help in a row\nalong one side, so that he might give\nthose students more help during the teleÂ¬\nvision lesson without disturbing the rest\nof the class.\n7. The use of television lessons is a form of team\nteaching. While the television teacher is busy\nwith one activity the classroom teacher can\n\"specialize\" in another.\n8. Television presents those things which students have\nin common - certain facts, certain methods, certain\nideas, etc.\nThe classroom teacher is responsible for\nadapting the follow-through to this common\nknowledge."
