I am satisfied that Overton\nmeans well and I have no reason to believe that he wouldn’t\nbreak through the ice*\nEvidently, even in the music field the whole problem is xvide\nopen* I know Clair Meader too but of course would go to\nPetrillo first* I guess bin closest contact is in the\nmotion picture field but I cannot understand what he means\nby WI suppose the general theory that Brewer’s hostility\ncould do us a great deal of harm in the film world T am\nsure he is referring to Roy brewer*who is a friend of line—\nbut if it is a personal opposition, he is no longer with IATSE*\nAnyhow, it is pretty obvious that very little has been done\nin the entire field, and that thcro is room for a general\npolicy* * *\nSincerely,\nMSNss"
