What happened afterward is referred to sometimes as the imperial restoration, sometimes the Meiji restoration. In 1968, Japan is celebrating the centennial of that event, popularly viewed as marking the end of the first century of Japan's process of modernization. In this introductory program, Professor Maki begins his analysis of a number of issues and events that have carried Japan's history over the past century. ]]></description><link>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-p843wb0m/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-p843wb0m/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 1968 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://mith-uta.s3.amazonaws.com/data/audio/cpb-aacip-500-p843wb0m.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mp3"/><dc:creator>Four College Radio</dc:creator><dc:subject>World Politics</dc:subject></item><item><title><![CDATA[Episode 12: Japan: The New Society]]></title><description><![CDATA[Professor Maki discusses some of the changes in Japanese society since 1945, which he describes as a transition from a modern authoritarian to a modern democratic society, including constitutional freedoms such as human rights and universal suffrage; maintaining a policy of pacifism in the face of encroaching communism; the rise of agricultural development and land ownership; and the economic miracle of Japanese production and consumer affluence as a consequence of postwar reconstruction.]]></description><link>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-vd6p458q/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-vd6p458q/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 1968 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://mith-uta.s3.amazonaws.com/data/audio/cpb-aacip-500-vd6p458q.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mp3"/><dc:creator>Four College Radio</dc:creator><dc:subject>War &amp; Civil Defense</dc:subject></item><item><title><![CDATA[Episode 8: Prelude to Pearl Harbor]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the 10 years from September 18th, 1931--the beginning of the Manchurian Incident--to the attack on Pearl Harbor, there had been an accelerating sharpness of the confrontation between the United States and Japan.

By June, 1945, both Japan and the United States were confronted with fundamental questions: the American problem was
how to end the war without an invasion of Japan; and the Japanese problem was how to end the war on what the Japanese would regard as reasonable terms. This program looked at the events leading to the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by nuclear weapons as well as Japan's surrender.]]></description><link>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-1v5bh313/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-1v5bh313/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 1968 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://mith-uta.s3.amazonaws.com/data/audio/cpb-aacip-500-1v5bh313.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mp3"/><dc:creator>Four College Radio</dc:creator><dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945</dc:subject></item><item><title><![CDATA[Episode 3: The Reign of the Emperor Meiji]]></title><description><![CDATA[This program profiles Emperor Meiji (1852-1912), the first of Japan's modern emperors, whose coronation marked the true beginning of the intensely complicated problem of modernization inside Japan.]]></description><link>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-js9h894b/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-js9h894b/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 1968 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://mith-uta.s3.amazonaws.com/data/audio/cpb-aacip-500-js9h894b.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mp3"/><dc:creator>Four College Radio</dc:creator><dc:subject>World Politics</dc:subject></item><item><title><![CDATA[Episode 6: The Roots of Militarism]]></title><description><![CDATA[The decade of the 1930s was marked by the beginning of a major phase of Japan's aggression.
