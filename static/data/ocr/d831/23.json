What educators want to teach must be subordinated, and modified\ninto harmony with what a reasonable minority of the population wants to know.\nEducators must face up to the necessity of using public funds in ways that produce\na defensible yield per dollar.\nOnce basic needs are established thiwugh research on the potential audience\nwe can turn to question# abofut approaches to handle actual audiences© A natur^al\ndivision in educational toroadcasting (especially television) seems to be between\ntwo types of audiences.©©Captive and faree© There is a parallel division in points\nof view ai^ the kinds of questions we will pose in research on audiences©\nIn the captive audience situation w® are more concerned with teaching mom\nefficiently what anst and should be taught. In the free audience situation, w©\nare more Interested in teaching things in such attractive fashion that large\naudiences will be attracted to voluntary learning.\nHaving these two orientations poses the initial problem of how the educational\nstation can project an unambiguous image and the subsequent research followup of\nwhether the station has been successfia in doing so. We can list some of the probloms\nfor research under the captive and free audience condtions©\nFor captive audiences:\nWhat lessons, se^nts of subject matter, are traditionally difficult for students?\nWhat areas of knowledge are movinf so fast that many teachers actually are not up to\nthe minute in their own subjects? What blocks of information are so unambiguouf^y"
