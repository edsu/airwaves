If he should get sufficient assurances of support from his\nown Christian Democratic party and other parties of th© democratic middle th©\nnext step then would be to form a slate of ministers — a cabinet.\nHe then would take this list of ministers to the guirinale for President\nEinaudi’s approval. Then would come the big test? th© presenting of his\ncabinet and his projected program to the Chamber of Deputies and the senate.\nOnly when that action has resulted in a vote of confidence will Italy’s\ncabinet crisis be officially ended and a new government launched.\nThis is Graham Hovey, signing another Letter from Italy produced for the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters. On this program you heard\nthe actual voices of President Luigi Einaudi, retiring Premier Giuseppe Pella,\nPremier-designate Aialntore Fanfani, and Ferdinand© Carbone, secretary-general\nof the Presidency of the Republic, as they were recorded by newsmen of Radio-\ntelevision© Italians during the January cabinet crisis. This program was\nrecorded in the studios of Radio Rome with the assistance of Dott. Antonello\nMarescalchi of the special ©vents department of Radiotelevisione Italiana.\nThis is the NAEB network."
