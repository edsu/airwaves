Wilson Papers span the\n\t\t  period 1906-1991 and includes clippings, correspondence, inter-office\n\t\t  memoranda, reports, writings, speeches and personal diaries that highlight\n\t\t  Wilson's 40 year career (1930-1971) as an executive with the J. Walter Thompson\n\t\t  Company (JWT). The bulk of materials fall between 1946 and 1971, and covers the\n\t\t  period from Wilson's return to JWT following military service in World War II\n\t\t  until his retirement. As General Counsel and head of JWT's Legal Department,\n\t\t  Wilson oversaw contractual relations pertaining primarily to the sponsorship of\n\t\t  radio and television programs for a number of clients--including DeBeers\n\t\t  Consolidated Mines, Ltd., the Eastman Kodak Company, the Ford Motor Company,\n\t\t  the Scott Paper Company and Unilever. The collection reveals JWT's\n\t\t  relationships with radio and television personalities--such as Fred Allen and\n\t\t  Edgar Bergen--and professional organizations including the Radio Writers Guild\n\t\t  and the Television Writers of America. In addition, materials in the collection\n\t\t  touch on the anti-communist movement and blacklisting within the U.S.\n\t\t  entertainment industry of the 1950s--involving personalities such as Jean Muir\n\t\t  and John Henry Faulk, among others. The collection also includes records from a\n\t\t  number of JWT international offices, with heavier representation from offices\n\t\t  in London; Bombay (Mumbai), India; and Johannesburg, South Africa, along with\n\t\t  records kept by some of Wilson's predecessors, such as Donald Foote and Sam\n\t\t  Meek, and the South African advertising executive and politician James Hamilton\n\t\t  Russell.<\/abstract>\n               <\/did>\n            <\/objectXMLWrap>",
