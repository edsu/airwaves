As against the Uni¬\nversity’s claim it has been urged\nthat the operation of a station by\nthe University would be an inter¬\nference with freedom of enterprise,\nthat it is not an educational func¬\ntion, that it would involve an un¬\njustifiable expenditure of public\nfunds, and that the people do not\nwant educational programs. Hence,\nit is asserted private business has\na clear priority over the University\nfor obtaining a license from the\nfederal communications commis¬\nsion. I would like to make some\nobservations on each of these\npoints.\n(1) It is difficult to see upon what\ntheory a commercial agency has a\npriority over a public institution to\nthe free use of air space which is\na part of the public domain. Pri¬\nvate business does not own the\nspace through which it must propel\nelectrical waves in order to trans¬\nmit .its services to the people. This\nspace is at^the disposal of the gov¬\nernment for the public good, and\nthe University being a public\nagency ought to have a claim to\nits use for educational purposes\nsuperior or at least equal to the\nclaim of a private institution.\nMoreover if the University en¬\nters the telecasting field it will not\ncome into unjustifiable competi¬\ntion with business, as some critics\nhave charged. The principal ob¬\njective of the University in oper¬\nating a television station will be to\nprovide the people with educa¬\ntional and cultural prograjns. In\ndoing this it will not engage in\nprivate business. It will not com¬\npete in selling the air as an ad¬\nvertising- medium, nor as an agent\nfor the purchase or sale of goods\nor services of arty kind. The pri¬\nmary purpose for which private\nenterprise proposes to use the air\nis advertising., It will sell time on\nthe air at so much per minute,\nduring.which the merits of various\ncommodities and services will be\nrepeatedly extolled and pro¬\nclaimed. Between commercials,\nprograms of a type primarily cal¬\nculated to attract other and bigger\ncommercials will be planned and\nstaged. This is not said dispar¬\nagingly. The procedure must neces¬\nsarily be of this type because of\nthe nature of the enterprise. In n6\nother way can the business be con¬\nducted profitably. In no other way\ncan many costly and valuable pro¬\ngrams be placed on the'air. But\nthese considerations serve to point\nup ..the fundamental differences hi\nthe objectives of a University and\na commercial television station.\nThere is an overlap. There are con¬\nflicts. But each has its place. There\nis no unjustifiable invasion of the\nfreedom of enterprise by the Uni¬\nversity. It must not be overlooked\nthat public, education is as deeply\nrooted in the American tradition\nas private enterprise.\n(2) Is operating a television sta¬\ntion a University function? The\nfunction Of a' university is educa¬\ntion, and education consists at least\npartly in the / dissemination of in¬\nformation antf ideas by means of\nlectures, demonstrations, booKs,\nmovies, radio and other methods of\ncommunication. Television is one of\nthe most effective forms of com¬\nmunication yet contrived by man.\nIts educational potentialities are\nstill beyond the reaches of the im¬\nagination. il has the power to place\nhitherto Unavailable educational op¬\nportunities within the homes of\nthousands of people, young and olct.\nShould this valuable educational\ndevice be denied to the University\nbecause private business desires it\nfor use as an advertising medium?\n(3) It.would seem to follow that\nif the operation of a television sta¬\ntion is an educational function, the\nappropriation of public funds for\nits operation would be justifiable.\nOf course the legislature would\nstill control the purse strings, and\nwould have the ultimate power to\ndetermine the allocation of funds\nto it. The vote of legislators on\nthe matter, no doubt, would be de¬\ntermined by its proved value to the\npeople of the state. The objection\nby commercial stations to the ex¬\npenditure of funds by the state for\ntelevision is no more valid than an\nobjection by privately owned tech¬\nnical -and engineering schools to\nstate expenditures for engineering\nshops‘and laboratories.\n(47 Do the people of the state\nwant educational programs? On\nthis point the representatives of\nprivate business are on the horns\nof a dilemma. If they say the peo¬\nple do not want educational pro¬\ngrams, a University station would\noffep them no competition in public\nappeal, and their objection on this\nscore would have to be withdrawn.\nIf they say a University station\nwill offer them competition then\nthey must recognize that the peo¬\nple want educational programs.\nNow if privately operated stations\npropose to sponsor educational pro¬\ngrams then it is admitted that tele¬\ncasting is an enterprise, into which\nthe University, as an educational\ninstitution, has a right to enter.\nIf the people of the state want edu¬\ncational programs and are willing\nto pay the costs to enable the Uni¬\nversity to supply them, why are\nthey not entitled to them? It can\nhardly be contended at this late\ndate that education is not a matter\nof public concern or that it should\nnot be supported at public expense.\nIt is not denied that television is\na legitimate and desirable field in\nwhich private enterprise may oper¬\nate, or that television advertise¬\nment is not 4 beneficial and an\nessential branch of that business.\nThe contrary is true. Nor is it\ncontended that the University\nshould have exclusive telecasting\nrights in this area of the state. The\ncontention is simply that the op¬\neration of a , television station\ncomes, within the proper sphere of\neducation and that the University,\nin order to perform its educational\nresponsibilities should be granted\neither full or part time control\nover a television station. If all\navailable practicable air channels\nwere awarded to commercial in¬\nstitutions then the vesting of sub¬\nstantial interests in reliance there¬\non could forever block education\nfrom entering the field. This might\nwell have serious consequences. A\nmonopoly in television by business\nwould be as harmful as monopoly\nin television by the state.\nGEORGE W. GOBLE\nProfessor of Law"
