Bernstein, because I\nfeel he is a fine gentleman in every ivay, and I asstime that this\nstatement speaks for his character.\nRegarding his qualifications, he has been unusually fortunate\nbecause he has been in an over-all management position i?ith a\nlarge company during the two years that I have known him. He\nwas specifically, during part of that period, responsible for\na single Radio Station operation as well. It is my feeling\nthat this qualifies him :*n a broader way than most people.\nIn connection with his ability, he not only gets along well\nwith people, but I have seen him go into a very trying situation\naqd increase volume and cut expenses - X know of no two actions\nthat are more necessary and vital In the operation of Stations.\nIf you have any further specific questions you would like to\n3sk me, please feel free to do so.\"\nIt is my firm feeling that whoever has George working with them\nwill be extremely fortunate.\nVery sincerely.\nJohn Pattison Williams\nExecutive Vice President\nHoward S. Frazier, Esq.\n72& Bond Building\nWashington 5, D. C."
