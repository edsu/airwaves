It was good of you to write me on the occasion\nof my leaving the Board of NAEB. For your information, the\nbooks are in the hands of the Auditor, Harold Hill will\ndrive over on the 13th to pick them up and complete the\nfinal transfer to Utbana.\nI leave active service in NAEB with mixed emotions. I am\nsure that the business can be better coordinated at headquarters\nthan it could ever be at a member station. However this\nbrings to an end a number of years of service during which\nI have been a Vice President, Chairman of various commltties\nincluding the Research Committee for several years, and\nTreasurer for five years. If I have been able to contribute\nto the organization during these years I am happy. If I\nhave been able to be of assistance to you, in what I consider\nto be one of the very best years NAEB has had, I am also\nhappy.\nIt has been a pleasure to work with you. I suspect that I\nmay have attended my last meeting but we shall see.\nBest regards and Happy New Year.\nSincerely vnnrs\nR. J.Coleman"
