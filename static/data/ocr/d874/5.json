Incumbent receives only $2,400 (although $2,640 budgeted), and will be\nraised to $2,640 as of July 1, thus causing increase for the individual\nbut not an increase in the amount budgeted for the position.\n6. Labor requirements less than last year because we no longer have to pay\nan outside engineer at an hourly rate to maintain the equipment.\nJG\nHarold E. Hill\nJanuary 30, 1957"
