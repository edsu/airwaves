Apart from clerical errors in its preparation (such, as the erroneous listing\nof WKYG’s frequency), the shortcomings of the station directory distributed several\nmonths ago are attributable to either (a) failure of stations to respond to ques¬\ntionnaire and follow-up letters, or (b) inadequacy of the questionnaire itself.\n2o The proper course of action to be taken in remedying the shortcomings of the\noffensive station directory depends on which of the three possible shortcomings you\nhave in mind® I take it we all agree in disliking clerical errors, so that leaves\nthe two other sources of dissatisfaction® I suppose that even the most indifferent\nmembers will finally respond to questionnaires after receiving, say 8 or 10 follow¬\nup letters® So, given patience enough, Jim and I can eliminate the shortcomings\narising from initial non-response®\n3® This leaves inadequacy of the information sought by the questionnaire as the\nthird, and last source of trouble® Jim’s letter seems to m to as sun® that it is\nthis factor which underlies the complaints® I don’t know whether tills is the fact\nor net, but I have sensed that it was not® If I am wrong in this impression, then\nit seems to me that the next step is for the complainants to tell us in what re¬\nspect the information sought to be collected by last year’s questionnaire was de¬\nficient® In doing so they will probably tell us what policy purposes are ill-served\nby these deficiencies * But until and unless we are advised of specific shortcomings\nin the information sought to be collected last year, I would assume that hurt feel¬\nings could be assuaged by collecting the same information from substantially all\nmembers, and publishing a new edition\"free cF clerical errors®\ni*® Unless Jim and I are advised to the contrary, I would think we should follow\nthis course®\nSincerely yours.\nDWS:wc\nDallas Wo Smythe\nDirector of Studies"
