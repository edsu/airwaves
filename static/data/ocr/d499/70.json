It has tried to main¬\ntain a fair balance of national and international news, laying stress\nusually on the most important news of the day. Its news operations are\nguided by the Broadcasting Code which calls for the objective presenta¬\ntion of news, the promotion of communal harmony, religious tolerance and\ninternational understanding and goodwill and high standards of decency\nand decorum. News and news magazine occupy about l6/o of the total air¬\ntime. This high percentage of time given to news is based on the con¬\ncept that in a developing country where great strides are taking place\nit is important that the people be informed of what is going on in every\npart of the country and also of what is happening in countries around us.\nIn this manner this medium can make a very useful and important contribu¬\ntion towards national development,,\n5) Education\nPure educational television for schools is still at a pilot stage in\nTelevision Malaysia.
