FLETCHER\nTO RALPH LOWELL\nApril 24* 1951\nMr. Ralph Lowell, Trustee\nThe Lowell Institute\n26 Newbury Street\nBoston, Massachusetts\nDear Mr. Lowell:\nOn behalf of the members of the Board of The Fund for Adult Education, I wish\nto express appreciation to you for working out the plan whereby the Lowell\nInstitute will administer the expenditure of the $300,000. which the Board\nhas granted to a special committee of the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters for planning and producing five series of programs for the Educa¬\ntional Radio Network. This committee is composed of Messrs. Richard Hull,\nHarold McCarty, George Probst, Seymour Siegel and Parker Wheatley.\nWithin the next few weeks, $100,000. will be sent to the Lowell Institute to\ncover preliminary expenses of this project, such as program planning meetings\nand securing talent for research, script writing, program direction, auditions,\netc. The balance of the grant will be made available as needed in the planning,\npreparation, production and distribution of the several series of programs.\nIt is our understanding that this special committee and the National Associa¬\ntion of Educational Broadcasters will set up a board to oversee this project\nand that this board will employ an administrative staff to manage it. A pro¬\ncedure should be worked out which is satisfactory to you for making withdraw¬\nals against the fund.\nThe Board of The Fund for Adult Education hopes that this grant may be instru¬\nmental in bringing important new resources to broadcasting in America and that\nit will, in some measure, complement the fine work now being done by the Lovell\nInstitute Cooperative Broadcasting Council and by many of the educationally-\nowned radio stations.\nYours sincerely.\n(Signed) C. Scott Fletcher\nPresident\nFund for Adult Education"
