Com.\nIstanbul\nSERIOUS MUSIC - OTHER\nAttached you will find a proposal emanating from Mr. Roger\nAubert (SSR),who was Chairman of the jury of the recent EBU Inter¬\nnational Beethoven Piano Competition. This proposal was examined\nby the Bureau of the Committee in January and its opinion was not\nwholly favourable. It felt, for example, that the first part of\nthe competition, devoted to violin making, was not really adapt¬\nable to radio treatment and it believed that, as regards the second\npart of the competition, there were already enough - if not too\nmany - violin competitions in existence. It believed that future\ncompetitions organized by the Radio Programme Committee should be\npegged to some such event as the Beethoven Anniversary Year and in\nthis respect the proposal of Mr Mertens (BRT) for the Scriabin\nanniversary (referred to on page 2 of the note accompanying Item 2\nof the Agenda) is relevant.\nThe Committee is invited to examine the proposal of\nMr Aubert and to take a decision on whether or not to proceed with\nit."
