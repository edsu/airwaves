When Harry Skornia was here he\ncould not recall anything about this matter.\nHave been very much under the weather for\nthe past month, and am still convalescing,\nand have to be ready to pull out for a\n(couple of weeks in Kalamazoo at the end of\nthis week. Between the package mailed out\nto you June 30 and the one that I am mailing\nto you today, you have the gist of the report\nand of the syllabus. Heaven knows it is in a\nsomewhat messy state. Most of it was dictated\non my back in the hospital and at home.\nHowever* I had lots of chance to talk it over\nhere with Harry and to explain my scope and\nintent. For the present at least, I just want\nyou to have the materials in hand and should\nmore copies be needed they can be provided.\n1 have three copies of the Gutenberg Galaxy **\n/U. brCttV’-ei- made. One of these is the property of Bob\nShafer, who paid for it and also contributed\nto defraying the expenses of the video. I\nthought that the NAEB should have one copy,\nand that perhaps Washington should have one.\nIf there Is still money in our kitty, it\nwould be nice to have some more copies made,\nat $125 apiece.\nyo“rB"
