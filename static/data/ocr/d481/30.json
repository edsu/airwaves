Too are the nee\ndirector for Region XI on the Radio Board*\nBecause Roy Flynn transferred to a new position at an\ninstitution which does not hold an active membership, he be¬\ncame ineligible to hold office; hence, as provided by the By¬\nlaws, an election was held by the Board of Directors to determine\nan interim director to serve until the regular election is held\nthis winter.\nX am delighted at the choice, both personally and pro¬\nfessionally. Xt pleases me to have you as an excellent\naddition to the Board; X am also pleased that the KARS has\nin this way given you some small recognition and reward for\nthe outstanding job you did in developing the public affairs\nprogramming from Washington for the HARE network*\nOf course, all this pales beside the production accomp¬\nlishment of your wife, though X suppose you can claim some\ncredit as a contributing force*\nJewell and X send our congratulations on this latest\n(and best) Press release*\nCordially,\nWilliam 6* Barley\nW0Bsasm\nP*S. Harold Hill will be sending you some assorted stuff\nre your director duties*\nw** Hull"
