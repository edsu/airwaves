The free and frank\nexchange of information was, I wwwume, helpÂ¬\nful to the corporation staff.\nThough the nature of the meeting was\nessentially exploratory, it seems to me that\nsome tentative directions were indicated.\nSome items the corporation might consider\nwould include:\n1. The identification of a person who would\nserve as CPB's staff representative for\neducational radio.\n2. The activation of a radio news and public\naffairs bureau in Washington, D.C..\nSuch a bureau co&ld be joined with a\ntelevision service.\n3. The development of facilities providing\nfor live interconnected radio broadcasts\non a daily basis."
