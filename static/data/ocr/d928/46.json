MOUNTED):\nProvides simultaneous control of all units. Duplicating is controlled by a master power control (and indicator\nlight), a start button, (and recording indicator light) and a stop button.\nINDIVIDUAL CONTROLS:\nProvide optional separate control of each unit.\nThe master playback unit and each duplicating recorder have the following controls:\nPilot Light Rewind-Fast Forward-Play Lever\nPower Switch Tape Speed Selector Switch\nStart Button Reel Size Selector\nStop Button\nTwo separate high powered amplifiers are provided, one for each channel. They are of extremely low effective\nimpedance in order to provide a virtually constant voltage source for the record buss which each feeds. Thus\nthe number of duplicating recorders being fed can be varied from one to ten without appreciably varying\nthe feed level to any one individual recorder.\nMASTER PLAYBACK — Plug-in type head assembly containing two half-track playback heads. On single track\nrecordings, only one of the heads is used.\nDUPLICATING RECORDERS — Plug-in type head assembly containing two half-track recording heads and\none full-track recording head.\nAny of the following can be made: (1) full-track duplicates; (2) half-track duplicates; (3) simultaneous (double)\nhalf-track duplicates, and (4) two-track stereophonic duplicates.\nEach head circuit has individual metering jacks for rapid, accurate adjustment of the record level and bias\npeak. A vacuum tube voltmeter and an audio oscillator are generally used. The ten slaves can be checked\nin a matter of minutes, making it simple to maintain exact adjustments for peak performance.\n10 amperes at 115 volts A.C.\nMaster playback unit 49 inches Master control panel 3/2 inches\nMaster bias oscillator 83A inches Each duplicating recorder 293A inches.\nMaster amplifier panel 83A inches\nEach console stands 36/2 inches high and occupies floor space 26 x 25/2 inches.\nMaster playback and master control panel in Master playback, control panel, master bias\nconsole; master bias oscillator and master oscillator, and master amplifier panel for rack\namplifier panel for rack mounting . . . 335 lbs.
