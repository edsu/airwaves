The man obeyedj his nerve had gone. Very well. After the\nshave, Mr. Lynds dismissed him, and do you know what he said?\nI cannot conceive.\nMr. Lynds turned to that man, and said, f6I knew that you wanted to Trm\nme 5 but I despised you too much to believe that you would ever have the\ncourage to execute your design. Alone, and without arms, I am always\nstronger than all of you.,r Very well. Mr. Lynds had great personal\nauthority; but behind there stood the authority of his system. He is\nno longer warden; but look out of the window. Do you see any walls?\nNo.\nBut I see swarms of convicts labouring in the open; what are they doing,\nworking with stone?\nThey*re stone-breaking, yes. We have here today nearly a thousand\ndesperate criminals. We keep them here without walls, and they work\nin the open. There have been no attempts at revolt; and, as you can\nsee, the convicts work unmanacled. Very well, now, gentlemen, I have\nassigned to you the inspectorÂ®s quarters in the prison; and you may\npursue your studj.es from there. You will find it unavailing to mingle\nwith the men, in 'the hope of overhearing something. Not a word is ever\nspoken. But if you wish to know about the men, I refer you to the prison\nchaplain. Call me on, gentlemen, in any way in which I can be of service."
