Smyths\nDirector of Studies\nHAEB\n419 David Kinley Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dallas:\nI have your note of April 24th concerning\nthe payment of your residual expenses, which you in¬\ncurred at Columbus. While I, personally, would be\nhappy to approve these as a proper charge to the HAEB\nMonitoring Studies, this is a matter that should be\nconsidered by the Executive Committee at its next meet¬\ning on May 23rd. I do not have late information about\nthe Monitoring fund and I also feel rather strongly that\nsuch an expenditure should have been approved in advance.\nHowever, since the Board specifically indicated that it\nwas not defraying any expenses to attend the recent\nmeeting at Columbus, I am without authority to authorise\npayment. I shall certainly be pleased to present the\nmatter at the Executive Committee meeting arxi 1 regret\nonly that you may be compelled to wait a few weeks for\npossible reimbursement.\nIf you fell that Dean Schramm1s Institute\nmay be in a better position to reimburse you, let me\nknow, and I will return your material to you.\nCordially yours.\nsns/h\nSeymour H. Siegel\nPresident"
