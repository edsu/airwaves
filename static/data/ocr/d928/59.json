Underwood, Jr.,\nNetwork Manager,\nnational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\n119 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nDear Bob:\nthank you for your letter of March 16 regarding the 1962 Couchi-\nching Conference. I have passed on your comments regarding the length\nof the program to the production department concerned, and I aa sure\nthey will take note of it. Although I am sure you will appreciate\nthat it is extremely difficult for us to tailor our programming to other\npeople’s needs, this is one of the great difficulties w# have to face\nin our efforts to place our programs outside Canada. We are directed\non the one hand to run an economical operation, yet on the other hand,\nthere are few steps we can take at this time to tailor our programs\nwith an outside market in mind.\nI a® glad to hear that you are not opposed to a per station assess¬\nment, and I think I canassure you that all 0.5. stations are subject to\nthe same or similar tern®. Having stated this, I should tell you that\na somewhat different offer was made to the E.R.K. group of stations#\nWithout going into the details, I can tell you that the initial approach\nmade to them was at a higher per hour cost, based on live or virtually\nimmediate delay in use of the material. However, it is most likely\nthat the rates quoted to you would be applicable to them subject to\ngeneral approval, and perhaps an operational basis being mutually agreed\nupon between the network group and your tape distribution net¬\nwork. I suspect the basis of your concern is that a certain Mew York\nstation may get the programs live and free. This will not happen this\nyear.\nI hope we can get together at Columbus.\nYours sincerely.\nAHP/ck\nCcs Mr. Harold E. Hill\nA. H. Partridge,\nInternational Exchange Officer.\nto. tiaroio t>. <uiu A //mi ■\nMr. William 0. Harley"
