  "text": "Mr. Raymond Hurlbert\n-2-\nOctober 5, 1962\nFrankly, I cannot predict the future role of radio in the total edu¬\ncational complex; but I do know that educational institutions will\nneed all of the devices of mass communication available as the\ndemands for educational services Increase in the nation, and I feel\nthat we must preserve our radio stations through this period of\ngreat emphasis on television so we will have time to re-study the\npeculiar contribution radio can make. You are aware of the demand\nfor FM frequencies on the part of coaaueFcial broadcasters. If we\ndo not hold the frequencies reserved for education now, we are\nlikely to see the time when the FM frequencies available for edu¬\ncational purposes are as rare as the AM frequencies have become.\nIf I have belabored the point over long, please forgive me. My\npurpose in so doing Is to urge that major attention be given at the\nregional meeting to educational radio. I know you and Len will\nhave to decide how valid my position is and what, if anything, can\nbe done about it at the Tampa meeting.\nAs a postscript, I think we might make some converts to radio of\nsome of the people who came into educational broadcasting via TV.\nPerhaps I'iAEB could send a special speaker on this subject for the\nmeeting. I know that Jim Miles has very recently prepared a very\nstrong document for his administration and Dick Hull has had to\ndefend a continuation of his radio operation to his administration\nin the last two or three years. Others have fought the battle and\nlost.\nReturning to a direct answer to your letter, I will be delighted\nto help in any way that I can.\nOA:dl\nccj Mr, Leonard Press"
