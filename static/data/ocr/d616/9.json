Early, Manager\nRecording and Record Sales\nRCA Manufacturing Co., Inc.\nCamden, New Jersey\nDear Sir\nAs president of the National Association of Educa¬\ntional Broadcasters I am writing in reference to the newr\nschedule of fees for the broadcasting of Victor and Bluebird\nRecords.\nAs you perhaps know, the membership of our organi¬\nzation consists, in the main, of educational broadcasting\nstations wiiich do not operate for profit. These stations\nutilize their services, among other things, to encourage the\nappreciation of good music and in doing so they encourage\nthe sale of records.\nThe majority of these stations have no budget for\nprograms but depend on talent from their own institution and\ngratis contributions from state and national organizations,\ncommunitites, etc. This service is all of the very highest\ntype given freely in the sole interests of the listeners.\nUnder conditions as outlined above there is a feeling\nthat an added burden of $10.00 monthly to pay for the use\nof records purchased by them, might not be justified. If\nconsideration could be given, to stations operating as noted\nabove, in allowing the broadcasting of your records free of\ncharge, I am sure such consideration would be amply repaid.\n^ay I hear from you at your . early convenience.\nYours truly,\nCM/af\nCarl Menzer\nPresident NAEB"
