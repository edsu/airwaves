In such case, the NAEB station would have first refusal\nof the program.\nYesterday I had a visit from Mr. Jan Broeksz who spent some time\nin the office talking about educational television developments in the\nUnited States. When are you coming over, I have a lot of hospitality to\nreciprocate.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH/vr"
