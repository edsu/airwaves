The good school attempts to provide a \"pay dirt\" curriculum.\nA) There are certain things which must get done or society will retrogress\nand decay. These we call \"basic social processes.\" Not a one of these\nprocesses can be carried on unless the people know, believe, and do\ncertain things, rather than their opposites. Since it is only through\neducation that knowledge can be gained, beliefs engendered, and behavior\ninduced, the carrying on of the basic social processes necessary to so¬\ncietal survival and improvement rests on education and can be accom¬\nplished only through education. To be of real help to teachers in pro¬\nviding a \"pay dirt\" curriculum, then, the radio writer*s materials\nmust usefully relate to these basic social processes.\nB) Some of these basic social processes are:\n1) Teaching youngsters to think and communicate. Only the schools\nseem able to do this in our modern society.\n2) Social Cement - the teaching of democratic values. The schools\nhave a tremendous opportunity to intellectualize these values:\nwhy they are there, the evidence that they are there, what they\nmean, what our tradition is.\n3) Acquiring skills to make a living.\nii) Physical security (particularly important at a time when so many\nstudents are concerned over military service.)"
