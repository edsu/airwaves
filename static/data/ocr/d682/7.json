  "text": "NAEB Network\nDistribution Schedule-Winter and Spring 195*1\nI Please note and pass on to whoever in your organization handles\nNAEB relations.\nII Two separate Network distribution schedules are here attached.\nA. Schedule \"A” lists the programs which have been offered\nfor Issues #1-17.\nB. Schedule \"B\" lists a POSSIBLE Spring Offering (issues #14-26)\nand will be modified. Beyond Issue #13 everything is still\ntentative.\nC. In-School programs, because of their different mode of\ndistribution, are not included in the schedule. They\nwill average 1:45 additional programming over a period\nof 20 weeks.\nIII Issue numbers at top of pages indicate weeks of the year by which\nprograms will be released for broadcast. (Eg. Issue #1 - week of\nJan. 3, 1950; #2 - Jan. 10; #6 - Feb. 7; #13 - Mar. 28; etc.)\nIV \"TOTAL HOURS PER ISSUE\" indicates the number of hours released to\nstations in a given issue. (Eg. Issue #8 consists of 7£ hours of\nmaterial released for broadcast on or after Feb. 21, 1954.) Once\nagain, these figures do not include In-School programs.\nV The figures following the series titles indicate program lengths.\n(Eg. The first program of the French Academy Talks, which will be\nreleased with Issue #5; is l/2 hour long. The last program of\nPopular Arts is 1 hour long.)\nVI Note that five series begin with Issue #5. The Network cannot\nattempt to distribute these programs earlier without going beyond\nits present resources — because of duplicator re installation,\nIn-School program duplicating schedule, and other pressures.\nVII If you have any further questions, or discover any errors or\nmisprints, will you let us know at once, please? Many Thanks.\nNetwork Hdq."
