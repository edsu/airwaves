Dr. Reichshauer speaking at the Industry Club\npointed out that a great role awaits Japan in molding Asia....\nand this importance lies in the ideological field. In the\npast, Japan proved that an Asian nation could modernize\nand keep step with the West. In the future, Japan could\ndemonstrate that democracy will work in an Asian country;\nand the experience of the Japanese people can be of immense\nservice to the rest of Asia. Dr. Reichshauer deplored the\nspiritual isolation of Japan in Asia, at present, but\npredicted that the gap between the Japanese and other Asian\npeoples would bo bridged in time.\nWCVmWt&YJW AND UNDER â€ž\nBusiness Circles in Japan are enthusiastic over the helpful\nnew guide released on how to do business with American\nfirms.\nThe exporter attempting to break into the American market\nfaces what appears to be a. formidable problem.

The result is a\n64 page pamphlet entitled the U.S. Market for OVERSEAS GOODS -\na gold mine of valuable information, tips, and suggestions;\nand probably the only booklet of its kind in print.\nTranslated into Japanese it is now in the hands of hundreds\nof Japanese executives, and their response is overwhelmingly\n( 2 )\nenthusiastic."
