I think this man was trying\nto impress us with the more spectacular and scandalous side of\nreligion in America.\nUnquestionably; but one cannot find out the center unless one has\nwalked the boundaries, These are the boundaries of American\nreligion. At the center lies the fervent purity of manners which\nwe have so often observed. We must never forget, Beaumont, that\nreligion gave birth to American society. It is mixed with all the\nhabits of the nation; and even American patriotism is peculiarly\nreligious. But I confess I should like to discuss this matter with\nsome of the clergy.\nWell, we will keep our eyes open, and lie shall see what can be done.\nI am sure in a country where all men are so approachable, the\nclergy will prove to be no exception.\nOVER TO THE INTER VIEW WITH TIIE C LEROY.\nTOC: It is very good of you. Father Power, to receive us with such\ncordiality.\nPOWER: (IRISH) I*m very happy to be of service to you gentlemen. Another glass\nof wine.\nBEAU: Thank you so much. You know it* s a very odd thing. Father Powers\nwhile wavere at the service, we almost imagined ourselves back in\nFrance. Toequev&He here. In fact, spoke to one of his neighbours\nin French, and I think very much surprised him. (THE OTHERS\nCHUCKLE) But when you came to preach your admirable sermon, we\nknew at once that we were in America and not in France; and not\nonly because you were speaking in English.\nTOC:\nBEAU:\ntoc:\nBEAU:\nmusic:"
