(For a description of the different de¬\ngrees or levels of support see Appendix A.)\n^ Each degree of support by instructional television requires a dif¬\nferent level of participation on the partof the classroom teacher.\nInstructional television is not intended to replace other instruc¬\ntional tools or methods, but to take its place in the total learn¬\ning experience, as part of a carefully-coordinated approach to\nlearning which employs the resource appropriate to the need and\nthe instrument most appropriate to the objective.\nThe role and functions of television in the classroom are not\nrigidly prescribed . Ideally, they stem from existing and defined\nneeds and are tailored to the specifications which such needs\nsuggest.\n^ What isdone with television in a particular instructional situa¬\ntion depends in large part upon what those involved with its\ndevelopment, selection and utilization need it to do and want\nit to do.\n^ Production or selection of televised instructional materials\nappropriate to the intended goals is an important aspect of util¬\nization. It is equal ly important that administrators and teachers\nunderstand and remember . . .\n. . .what these television lessons were designed and intended\nto do in the particular situation, and\n. . . the inherent strengths and weaknesses of television as an\ninstructional tool.\n9 The quality of instruction received through television is deter¬\nmined by the quality of instruction which is put into television.\nIt is a MEDIUM of instruction.\nA-6"
