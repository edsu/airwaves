Presently,\nthe president is bonded for $10,000 and the treasurer is\nbonded for $10,000. Since the president, as such, does\nnot handle the funds, I question whether or not he need be\nbonded. Second, I question if bond of treasurer should\nnot be raised to $20,000. In other words, I’d suggest we\ndrop bond on oresIdent, and increase bond on treasurer to\n#20,000. What do you say? The premium then would remain\nthe same as now — $50.\nAnother aspect, bond Is presently written in\nNew York. Unless you believe otherwise, I prefer to ehange\nto firm in Champaign-Urbana, and cancel out in New York.\nMy friends might t1ust as well have the pittance aB one of\nSy's In New Yftrk.\nYour memo on Advisory Board of four received.\nPYI, I talked with Miles and he is very happy with the\ndecision.\nSincerely,\nPrank B. Schooley"
