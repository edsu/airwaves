In considering this problem it must be kept in mind that such\neditorial expression may take many forms ranging from the overt statement\nof position by the licensee in person or by his acknowledged spokesmen to\nthe selection and presentation of news editors and commentators sharing'' the\nlicensee's general opinions or the making available of the licensee’s facili¬\nties, either free of charge or for a!fee to persons or organizations re¬\nflecting the licensee *s viewpoint either generally or with respect to specific\nissues. It should also be clearly indicated thrt the question of the re¬\nlationship of broadcast.editorialization., as defined.above, to operation\ninthe public interest, is not identical with the broader problem of assuring\nnfairness\" in the presentation of news, com eat or opinion, but is rather one\nspecific fn.cet of this larger problem.\n12. It is clear that the licensees authority to determine the specific\nprograms to be broadcast over his station Ogives him an opportunity, not avail¬\nable to other persons, to insure-that his personal viewpoint on any particular\nissue\" is presented in his station’s broadcasts, whether or not these views\nare expressly identified with the licensee. And, in absonse of governmental\nrestraint, he would, if he so chose, be able to utilize his position as a\nbroadcast licensee to weight the scales in line with his personal views,\nor even directly or indirectly to propagandize in behalf of his particular\nphilosophy or views on the v-riou.s public issues to the exclusion of any , .\ncontrary opinions. Such action can be effective and persuasive whether or\nnot it is accompanied by any editorialization in the narrow sense of overt\nstatement of particular opinions and views identified as those of licensee.\n13. The narrower question of whether any overt editorialization or\nadvocacy by broadcast licensees, identified as such is consonant frith the\noperation of their stations in the public interest, resolves itself, pri¬\nmarily into the issue of whether such-identification of comment or opinion\nbroadcast over a radio or television station with the licensee, as such,\nwould inevitably or even probably result in such over-emphasis on the side\nof any particular controversy which the licensee chooses to esoouse as to\nmake impossible any reasonably balanced presentation of all side's of such"
