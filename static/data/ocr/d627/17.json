When you and\nHarry have had a chance to go over this Proposal, drop me a line\nwith your thoughts â€¢\nDirector of School\nPrograms\nCRT/gvn\nP.S\nHarry, I'm sending you a copy of this letter as ah answer to your\nDecember 31 letter. I would very much like to serve as chairman of\nthe TV Sub-committee on Utilization. I take it, from this title, that\nthere is not going to be any major re-organization in the committee\nstructure. I would like to know if there will be a change and when.\nBy the way, I think it might be a darn good idea to put together an\ninformation piece of the committee structure of the N.A.E.B. For\ninstance, at the last conference I discovered several committees I\nhad never heard of before and they appeared, at least on the surface,\nto have some over-lapping functions.\nAs a P.S. this is turning into a letter on its own, but I wonder if\nyou could give me information about Gale Adkins. I have written to\nhim several times and have not had any reply. I noticed in your letter\nof December 31 you sent a carbon copy to him.\nc.c. Harry Skornia\nEnel."
