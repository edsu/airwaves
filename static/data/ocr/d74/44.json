C.\nDear Harold:\nIn response to your memo concerning committee reports, I feel\nthat it would be foolish for us to present a report from the re¬\nsearch committee for the past year since we have really made no\ncontribution to the association.\nAt the last convention, Ken Harwood and I met with Bill\nHarley and discussed some ideas which we had. We reiterated\nthese in a letter following the convention. These were ideas we\nfelt might promote more and better research among the educational\nstations and other members. With the recent headquarters move and\nthe general uncertainty about the future, Bill felt that we ought\nnot move ahead with any of those at that time — which I certainly\nunderstood.\nWe were represented at the recent Madison meeting and at the\nadvisory committee meeting for the survey of spectrum needs. How¬\never, on the latter, just as with the McLuhan project, the committee\nwas informed about the NAEB*s involvement with the project after it\nwas so far underway that there was little constructive help possible.\nAnyway, the point of all of this, is that we have nothing to\nreport.\nLooking forward to seeing you in Washington.\nCordially,\nSLB:mw\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
