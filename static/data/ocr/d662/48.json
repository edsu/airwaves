We are engaging in the first large\nscale promotional campaign and it would, of course, be disastrous\nand fatal if there were any breakdown in the distribution process«\nYour letter to Mr* Harley was discussed at the meeting of the\nAdult Education Committee over this past week-end in New York* Your\nsuggestion that any tape which might be used for Adult Education\nprograms would eventually redound to further usage by the Tape Net¬\nwork does not take into consideration the basic premise concerning\nthese programs* These programs were designed for use over and\nover again, over a period of 10-years or longero If one hundred\nstations were to carry one series this would involve 1300 rolls of\ntape and, of course, would take this tape out of circulation on a\nrather permanent basis*\nWe have previously* requested a grant for the distribution of these\nand future programs but thus far there has been no favorable action\non this request* This would mean, therefore, that the Tape Network\nwould have to allocate a sufficient sum to make the program permanently\navailable to member stations or at least provide sufficient tape to\ndistribute the series on the same basis as other programs are dis¬\ntributed, i0e0 the return of the tape to the network pool* In this\nlatter instance it is possible that future developments may make it\npossible to redistribute the tapes on a permanent basis as a result\nof income derived from the sale of programs to commercial stations*\nAt any event, let me reiterate that no matter what our past differ¬\nences have been I have every sincere confidence that you will handle"
