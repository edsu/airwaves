Griffiths\nFund for Adult Education\n914 East Green Street\nPasadena, California\nDear Bill,\nJust a note to let you know how very happy I was that you\nwere able to get to the fall convention in Norman, I regret\nthat there was no time for us to sit down for an informal talk0\nI regret also that you were net able to stay through the\ncomoletion of the committee reports and the resultant period of\nunderstanding and accord which was reached. You may have sensed,\nthat 1 was disturbed at signs of discord which I thought were\nevidenced« As the committee reports progressed, it became ob¬\nvious that the big weakness cf the Board operation had been a\nfailure to report adequately to the full membership trends and\ndirections in which the Board had been moving, I am hapoy to\nreoort to you, however, that at the conclusion of these reports\nthe Board was given a standing vote of confidence, endorsement,\nand aopreclaticn, and the convention ended on a stronger note of\naccord than has ever been evident before, I am sorry you had\nto be witness to a bit of family squabbling, but believe you\nwould have agreed with me at the conclusion of the reports that\nit was a necessary step in the history of a growing, expanding\norganisation,,\nAt .our final Board meeting, 1 devoted a great deal of time\nto bringing the new members of the Beard up to date snd ex¬\nplaining our relationship with the FAE and the Center. The new\nBoard expressed its interest in e continued friendly cooperation\nwith the FAE and the Center for the maximum development of edu¬\ncational broadcasting in America. I think we may lock forward\nto being able to move ahead constructively and with mutual re¬\nspect in this development.\nAgain, my thanks to you for spending some time with us6\nregards to Scotty*\nMy\nSincerelv yours,\nGraydon Ausmus\nPresident"
