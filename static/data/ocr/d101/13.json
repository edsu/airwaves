In this roie,\nhowever, the NAEB has sought to serve mainly as a catalyst and example\nto provide the stimulus for the introduction of such courses in the curricula\ncf educational institutions, themselves. To supplement this catalytic\neffort, in recent years, grants-in-aid were awarded to colleges and uni¬\nversities to permit them to up-grade radio and television workshops they\nwere by 1958 beginning to hold, by adding outstanding consultants or staff\nmembers to what they would otherwise have been able to do.\nThe results of these efforts, particularly in the areas of production,\nprogramming and technical operation, are now encouragingly apparent.\nAs this objective approaches realisation, as it now does, in nearly all\nareas except the training of teachers — both those who broadcast and\nthose who utilize broadcast-lessons — in accordance with the uncompromising\nstandards which the NAEB has sought to establish by example, the NAEB\ncan onoe again concentrate on the achievement of its role as a professional\nassociation of these professionally-trained individuals with the highest\nstandards which a respected profession can devise. This involves the\ndevelopment of standards, qualifications and classifications for Indi¬\nvidual NAEB professional membership as described later in this document."
