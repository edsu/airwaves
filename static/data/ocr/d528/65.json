While\nthis is a side product of the advisory council\nmeetings, I wanted you to know how helpful it was\nto us.\nWe look forward to working with you in the\nfuture, and I hope subsequent meetings go as smoothly\nand are as productive as the Madison gathering.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM;kh\ncc: John Macy\nRobert Swezey"
