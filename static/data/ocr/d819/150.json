Qno call to Harmon\nGrisewood started the dorndeat round of calls and conversa¬\ntions I*vo ever had—and I might add, a lot of annoyed reactions\nculminating in my getting slightly annoyed myself. Ho one\nthere at the BBC had ever heard about the HAEH Fulbrigfct and\nno one at the Embassy had ever heard about it. Finally Richard\nTaylor, Executive Secretary of the U.3. Education Corrsnission\nin London, came up with the fact that he had approved your\nselection the middle of May and returned your O.K. to Frances\nYoung at that time. X told one and all that we had been\nInstructed by Young to stand by for instructions from the\nFulbri^ht Commission in London—and we made some progress.\nYou have been approved and we are to communicate with\nGrisewood about the problem of getting them at BBC to name a\nreturn scholar as soon as we find a spot for him. Grisewood\nexpressed pleasure at having you with them and said he would\nbe glad to work with the people at the University of London\nin making your stay a profitable one and in using you most\nconstructively. 1 just talked to Frank about it and he is to\ntake it fVom here. You and the others will be hearing from him*\nSee you In the North Woods.\nSincerely,\nGrayuon Ausmus\nPresident, MLB\nOAi jeh\ncos Executive Committee &\nExecutive Director"
