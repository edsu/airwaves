A number of the shows on this list look\nextremely interesting and I wonder whether it would be possible for\nyou to send us for audition purposes programs 1 to 12 in the Payne\nCommunications Award Shows, and programs 3, 6 and 9 in the Popular\nArts in American series (Hitchcock and Handy and the panel on\nScience Fiction).\nWo did have an opportunity of listening to some of the \"Voices of\nt*urope” programs and it was with great regret that we found ourselves\nunable to make use of them. However, we have more definite spots in\nmind for some of the tapes requested in this letter.\nI am not sure at the moment what precise notation the parcel should\ncarry in order to admit it to Canada at the lowest applicable rate\nof duty but I think If the parcel Is labelled **Edu oational Tape\nrecordsj for audition purposes** there should be no difficulty.\nMany thanks for your co-operation in making these tapes avaiMxL®\nto us.\nlours sincerely,\n/s/ Gordon Cullingham\nGordon Cullingham\nTalks and Public Affairs\nNOTE BY SKCHNlAs Series was sent 12-23-53.\nJtenateJtete 3, 6 and 9 on 12-30-53"
