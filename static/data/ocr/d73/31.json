Today, education represents our largest single category of\npublic spending next to national defense -- $19 billion a year. What we\nare talking about for television facilities, then, is 13 per cent of one yearâ€™s\nbudget.\nNevertheless, to raise such a sum, a supreme effort will be\nrequired by every element involved in education -- Federal, State and Local\nGovernments, Foundations, Business and Industry, and other private sources.\nIt will not be easy, any more than the shift from planes to missiles was easy\nin a military sense. But it will be just as significant to education as missilry\nis to security.\nLast year, more than half the money spent by states and localities\non public-school education came from property taxes. In many communities,\nthis tax base is approaching the saturation point; historically, as a revenue'\nsource, it has been unresponsive to increases in national income.\nWhile elementary and secondary public-school enrollment has\ndoubled since 1900, expenditures for it have gone up more than seventy-fold.\nSince 1950 alone, such expenditures have risen over 150 per cent.\nWith present instructional methods, school costs are likely to\ncontinue climbing along with enrollments. With television, the economic\nground-rules can be drastically altered."
