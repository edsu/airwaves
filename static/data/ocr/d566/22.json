  "text": "General\nW\nBasically, the operation of the network has not been\nchanged since the headquarters moved to Illinois* When a series\nis definitely set, a tentative schedule is prepared on the basis\nof which an offer is made to the stations* A crude survey of\nthe stations was made in an attempt to arrive at the most deÂ¬\nsirable time lapse between the offering of a series and the\nbroadcast date of the first program* The suggestions ran from\ntwo weeks to several months * On the basis of a large number of\nthe survey returns and past experience, we endeavor to make the\noffer from a month to six weeks before the first program is to\nbe aired* This time interval seems to work fairly well for\nmost stations* Cuite a number of the school stations are unable\nto operate on this basis and, therefore, undertake to make copies\nof all programs for future scheduling*\nWhen the replies to the offer have been received, a\nfinal schedule is made up* Stations are advised if any major\nchange in time is necessary* When the schedule is ready, a program\n\"packet\" is sent to each station accepting the program. The\n\"packet\" includes, report sheets, addressed envelopes in which\nto return the report sheets, a copy of the final schedule, and\ncue sheets* Up to series 51~3, Music for the Connoisseur, shipping\nlabels were also included* However, the number of stations has\nnow grown so large as to make the typing of labels a wasteful\noperation* Either with the offer or the program \"packet\" we\ntry to include a list of the individual programs with as much\nspecific information about them as we can get* In sufficient\ntime to meet the broadcast date of the first stations the tapes\nare mailed out to each leg* From there on the operation is\nlargely in the somewhat hesitant hands of the postoffice*\nAs an appendix to this report samples of the administrative\nforms, program schedules, cue sheets, etc. are included*\n-11-"
