Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice*\nThe discrepancy in the amount charged for administrative expense Is a result of\nthe fact that such chargee are always made a month late in order to reflect\ncharges on actual expenses Incurred during the month In question.\nIn other words, the administrative expense charged to our account by the University\nfor the period July 1, 1958 — August 31, 1959 actually represents five percent\nof our expenses for the period June 1, 1958 — July 31, 1959* Our expenses,\nexclusive of administrative expense, for June, 1958 were $k,007.12, while those\nfor August, 1959 were $2030, Therefore, the expenses for which administrative\ncharges were figured by the University exceed actual expenditures during the\nfiscal year in the amount of §1,977*12,\nFive percent of this difference of §1,977*12 is §98.86, This, added to the\n§2,5U7*55 you show, brings the total administrative charge made by the University\nto §2,6l46,Ul, which is within four cents of the figure shown on our report. This\nlatter discrepancy is due to the fact that the administrative charge was figured\nmonthly by the Universityj the fractions of cents converted to whole cents each\nmonth results in a slightly different total than that obtained when the calcu¬\nlation is done on an annual basis,\nI»m sorry that we didn*t think to provide this explanation at the tine we\nsubmitted thB annual report, but I trust that the above explains the apparent\ndiscrepancy.\nWe missed you at the Convention in Detroit, I believe it was a success and\nthere were many developments which I look forward to discussing with you when\nthe opportunity arises.\nSincerely,\nHJS/HEH/jp\nHarry J, Skomia\nExecutive Director"
