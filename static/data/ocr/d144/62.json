However, it is clear that certain\neaaaittees having a brodd, association-wide responsibility\nwill be maintained as HftEB permanent cosnittees. One of these\nis ttie Public Delations Committee. I should be pleased if you\nid.ll continue as Chairraan tor the current year.\nAs you know, three laarabers of your 196$ committee are to\nrotate off of the committee. I should like you to suggest three\nreplacements, either reappointments or nm people. As soon as\nI have your recameMaUms, 1 will make the a^ointmmts to\nfill out your committee.\nPlease accept my thanks for all your good work in the past\nand my sincere hope that you will accept this responsibility\nfor future service to the mm.\nSincerely,\nraise\nWilliam 0.
