The momentum was not sustained, however, and the record of California\nviewed from the distance of eight intervening years is rather meager when con¬\ntrasted with that of many other states of the Union.\nClose upon the 1952 action of the FCC, Governor Warren convened in Sacramento\na statewide conference of more than 2000 community leaders. This conference,\nheld in December of 1952, studied the means and methods of activating the\neight television channels which had been reserved for education in Cali¬\nfornia. Only two of these channels -- San Francisco and Sacramento -- were\nin the standard (VHF) broadcast band. The remaining six reservations --in\nLos Angeles, Fresno, San Diego, San Bernardino, Stockton and San Jose *- ware\nin the little used ultra high frequency band, a factor which was to weigh\nheavily in their future use and development. In its consideration of the\nproblems of activating the educational channels, the Conference recommended\nagainst State control of these channels, suggesting instead that the channels\nbe activated and controlled by their own community organizations. The Confer¬\nence did recommend, however, that the State assist these community organizations\nin their efforts through the appointment by the Governor of a Citizen's Advisory\nCommittee on Educational Television."
