  "text": "not in the material but the mental sphere-- in the\natmosphere created by the Japanese people and the\nnation*s conduct of its daily life. Returning.to\nJapan after two years in the States, I am (again)\nimpressed by its apparent peace and contentment.\nDespite many problems, the Japanese still smile\nmore than .most people.. Public officials— at least\nthose with whom the visitor comes into contact'— are v;‘\ncourteous and.friendly. And to a unique degree the\nwhole Yamato race gives an impression of being In¬\nterested .in. the visitor* s comfort and concerned\nto make the, stranger feel welcome.\nAdd to that the quiet beauty of the country, a deep\nsense of tradition and timelessness, plus the simpli-\ncity and graciousness of Japanese life at its best,\nand it is not difficult t,o understand the impact\nwhich Japan, .makes .upon many foreign minds.\nIly Japan is. an Asian nation inhabited by a race of\npeople ...who, a century ago were living in, and condition¬\ned by, an agrarian economy which had remained un¬\nchanged .through centuries. Then came the Meiji\nmiracle— and . railroads , spinning mills , shipyards,\nmodern, armaments, big.business, parliamentary govern-1\nment,-hydronqlcctric. plants, diplomacy, exports and\nimportsr, a, growing bureaucracy, and the Westerners\nwith their, new ideas. Almost overnight, as the progress\nof nations, is measured, everything changed. Every¬\nthing^,. that is, except the people of Japan, who\ncontinued to.order their lives in accordance with\n17th century notions, traditions and beliefs even\"\nas they tended 20th century machines and by their\nenergies transformed this nation from a primitive\nagricultural economy into a world power."
