Sulzer, Director\nBadio TV D3Eiaamlcatioae, HFIU\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Elmer:\nI am very lauch impressed by the letter dated May 15 from Henry\nM^et to you. I am impressed not only by the contest, but by\nthe evidence of the thoughtful deliberation that went into the\npreparation of the letter, and I know we are all indebted to\nHank for the time and effort he has devoted. If all members\nof our MSB Committees had our interests at heart to this extent\nI am sure that we would continue to prosper and grow even more\nrapidly.\nUnfortunately, I have not yet had the time to digest all of the\ncontents of Bank’s letter, and am therefore not in a position\nto react to the various points he raises, or to your reactions\nto them. I am just ready to leave for a brief trip out of town,\nbut I hope to get to this matter in more detail as soon as I\nret’.rrn, and you will be hearing from me shortly thereafter.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEH:klp\nCC: Henry H. Mamet"
