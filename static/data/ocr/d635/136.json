There were a number of matters which the\nnew president was to take care of which should be handled\nsoon - such as a note to Griffith accepting the offer of\nthe funds for the seminar - so I shall look forward to\nhearing from youThe purpose of this note is to con¬\ngratulate you upon the new January, 195>3 schedule of NAEB\nreleases. To my way of thinking, this is the most intelli¬\ngent, most varied, most interesting and most significant\nline-up of shows we have placed on the net since we began\noperations. I would suggest a national release to all\nof the papers in the NAEB member station areas headlining\nthese programs.\nThe mimeographed note you received from me a day\nor two ago answers your question of combining the strategy\nmeeting with the FAE meeting in Chicago. I have written\nPaulu and Smythe regar^.ng the possibility of a meeting\nof our NAEB-NUEi^ofiyouP campus the night of December 2\nand the morning of December 3. I trust you will be avail¬\nable for that meeting also and I hope you will give\nWilbur a buzz and tell him that I hope to see him some\ntime on the 3rd if he is in town. I expect to get out\nof Urbana for Chicago on the afternoon of the 3rd to be\nin Chicago for a conference with two or three people on\nthe evening of the 3rd prior to the work of December U.\nDallas is taking care of room reservations for Morton\nand me and I have asked Burton to communicate with Dallas\nconcerning his wishes*\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W. SMYTHE\nIllinois University Communica¬\ntions Research Institute.\nUrbana, Illinois\nSECRETARY AND\nPUBLICATIONS EDITOR\nBURTON PAULU\nKUOM, U. of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nI am forwarding to you two tapes of our Rita\nBannerman's reading of Rebecca* Parker’s reaction in\nMinneapolis was that it was a waste of good talent to\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
