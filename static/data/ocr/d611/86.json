Philip Randolph\nSeptember 5, 1968\nMr. Kenneth Clark\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Mr. Clark:\nYour proposed format of an all black panel and moderator\ndiscussing urban problems with white \"reactors\" asking\nquestions has me intrigued. I'll admit I have trouble\nenvisioning men who have the ability to contribute to\nthe discussion that John Gardner and Fred Harris have\nbeing limited to asking questions. I can see men of\nthis caliber on the panel and in on the discussion while\nyou let savvy newsmen ask the questions. But you didn't\nask me.\nStill, my basic doubts about the viability of the format\nget in the way of my recommending candidates for\nparticipation. Under your ground rules I would suggest\nsome very knowledgeable professionals, such as some\nof the top staff members of the Kerner Commission or\nthe people who did the research for the last of the\n\"Of Black America\" series. This kind of person could\nbring clinical objectivity and a possession of factual\ninformation to the discussion. (So could a really\nwell-informed newsman.) I am afraid the philosophers\nwould be badly cut up.\nI hope this negative reaction to our first encounter doesn't\nput you off. I think there are useful things our\ntwo organizations can do together.\nVice President/Commyfnications"
