After many private discussions the national leadership of\nIIBir and IATSE formally adopted that policy with local contracts to\nbe negotiated on the local level. That it seemed to me acctmrolished\nthe overail objective we were seeking and gave the protection that some\nof the local groups wanted.\nI finally met with Ken Yard in Ann Arbor. His immediate problems\n-V^ s#t P*1Â®*-88*071 from AFTRA to repeat some of the programs on\nthe stations, and (2) to get a substantial reduction in the rotes charged\nTor performances. The goal Is to get AFTRA on a national level to give\nspecial consideration to noncommercial, educational television stations.\nThe only other craft to be covered would be the musicians. It seems\n*;hat ln th8 coming months we must try to evolve a national nolicy\nj?!1 51*?- American Federation of Musi clans. I am hopeful that they, too.\nwill follow the footsteps of IH5H and IATSE.\ncc:\nGraydon Austhus"
