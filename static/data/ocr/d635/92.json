When the Board\nwas rea<&- to discuss Jimâ€™s successor and get our ideas together\non vfoat our attitude should be in our meeting with Fletcher, we\nannounced that the Board would be in executive session, and\nonly members of the Board would be present at the meetings#\nThis created such a furor among a number of the members who are\nnot on the Board that everybody on the Board became considerably\ndisturbed at its effect. Although we announced very generally\nthat all other meetings of the Board were open to any member\nwho cared to attend, there was still a great deal of ill feeling.\nThe idea of declaring the Board in executive session came from\nno one but was the unanimous opinion of every member of the Board.\nThe repercussions were so great that every member of the Board\nwas of the opinion that we would have to announce and publish\nprior to our next Board meeting that all of our meetings were\nopen to any member of the organization. Some were of the opinion\nthat we could take up only routine matters at the se general\nsessions but that obviously is not the answer. We can discuss\nthis more at the Michigan meeting. Thought I diould pass it\nalong to you at this time."
