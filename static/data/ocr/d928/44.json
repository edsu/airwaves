  "text": "HIGH QUALITY TAPE DUPLICATES AT LOW COST...\neither single copies\nor mass production\nruns are now\neconomically\npractical...\nSPEED\nTrue mass production of pre-record¬\ned tapes can now be achieved. For\nexample, a full system of ten slave\nrecorders could in just eight minutes\nmake ten exact copies of a 2400 foot\ndouble-track master of in/sec.\ntape speed. It would take 20 hours\nto produce the same number of du¬\nplicates on a pair of standard re¬\ncorders operating at W2 in/sec.\nAmpex’s tremendous speed-up re¬\nsults from three things: (1) duplicator\ntape speed of 60 in/sec; (2) simul¬\ntaneous duplication of both tracks\nof a double track tape; (3) use of up\nto 10 slave recorders with one mas¬\nter playback unit.\nQUALITY\nThe superb fidelity of a good master\ntape can now be faithfully repro¬\nduced in any number of duplicate\ntapes. Ampex tape “know-how” and\nengineering skill has produced a\ntape duplicator which meets the\nsound quality demands of audio en¬\ngineers, broadcast technicians, high\nfidelity enthusiasts and other critical\nusers. Frequency response to 15,000\ncycles is available on 7'/2 in/sec.\nduplicates. Signal-to-noise ratio is\nmore than 45 db over the entire\nrange. Flutter and wow is below\n0.2% rms.\nSlave unit — from one to ten of these units can be\nused with each master playback machine.\nDESIGN\nThe basic Ampex Tape Duplicator sys¬\ntem has a master playback unit, master\namplifier panel, master bias oscillator,\nmaster control panel and one duplicat¬\ning recorder. This equipment would\nmake one duplicate at a time.\nAdditional slave recorders may be\nadded to this basic duplicating system\n— one or more at a time —up to a maxi¬\nmum of ten. This Ampex “building\nblock” design provides complete equip¬\nment flexibility because the initial in¬\nstallation of the basic Ampex Tape\nDuplicator can be quickly and eco¬\nnomically expanded to suit growing\nneeds of the user.\nThe duplicating process consists of play¬\ning a master tape on the master play¬\nback unit and feeding the output to one\nor more duplicating recorders. Proper\namplification and equalization is pro¬\nvided by the master amplifier panel;\nhigh power, high frequency bias for all\nrecorders is generated by the master\nbias oscillator. Hence it is unnecessary\nfor each of the individual slave record¬\ners to contain these electronic functions.\nAll operating components are started\nby one push-button on the master con¬\ntrol panel. Normally these master con¬\ntrols are used in lieu of the individual\ncontrols on each recorder.\nSUMMARY OF FEATURES\nConvenient and versatile operation\n• Makes 3%, 7]/2 or 15 in/sec. dupli¬\ncates from masters of the same speed;\nalso makes 3% in/sec. duplicates from\n71/2 in/sec. masters.\n• Handles all reel sizes up to IOV2 inch¬\nes — up to 14 inches on special order.\n• Duplicates both single and double\ntrack masters in one pass of the tape.\n• Runs master tapes “backward” to\neliminate need for rewinding dupli¬\ncates before use.\nQuality, economy and reliability\n• Duplicates 3% in/sec. tapes with re¬\nsponse to 7,500 cycles (15,000 cycles\nfor 7Y2 in/sec. tapes).\n• Maintains 45 to 50 db signal-to-noise\nratio.\n• Produces up to 1200 hours of play¬\nback material in an 8-hour work day.\n• Uses major components that have\nbeen operationally tested and proved\nin standard Ampex recorders.\nPositive and flexible control\n• Simultaneous control of all compo¬\nnents is provided by the master con¬\ntrol panel.\n• Duplication starts at the push of a\nbutton; full speed is attained in five\nto ten seconds.\n• The master playback unit and each\nduplicating recorder are also equip¬\nped with full controls.\n• Any slave recorder may be stopped\nor started during duplication without\naffecting operation of the others.\n• All operations are meter-monitored.\n2"
