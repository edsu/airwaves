However, I don't think the singing is in the most desired\nstyle. For example, I feel that Toelken on THE WANDERING BALLAD SINGER\nis the better balladeer. Otherwise, this program is substantially\nsuperior to the BALLAD SINGER. Would suggest that both these programs\nnot be offered at the same time, using the better program with an\notherwise weaker offering.\nTHE SOVIET SCENE—two ’’yeses.” I am not so keen on this program\nas the other two. Unfortunately Mrs. Gasiorowgki is difficult to\nunderstand, though it should be noted that understanding increases as\nthe program progresses. I object to dluch blatant uses of the propaganda\ntechniques, for I feel they decrease the credibility of what she has\nto say. This is not to say that I don’t believe what she has to say,\nbut I feel almost gullible if I accept what she says after such a\npatent presentation. Yet, because I believe the material is authentic,\nand because I believe there is a great need for this sort of thing, I\nvote a reluctant ”yes.”"
