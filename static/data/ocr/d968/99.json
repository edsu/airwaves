I, however,\nam disappointed that a full step was not taken toward making this a Public\nBroadcasting Act of 1967 rather than using television only in the title.\nThis is’\"a small point but it is significant since it indicates a less than\nfull commitment to the potential of educational radio.\nPerhaps before the legislation is enacted by the Senate such a change\ncould be made, I certainly would be grateful for your help in bringing it\nabout•\nThank you for your continued interest.\nSincerely yours.\n(Mrs.) Marjorie Newman\nProgram Director, WFSU-FM\nMN/je"
