Scott Fletcher j, President\nFund for Adult Education\n914 East Green Street\nPasadena 1* California\nDear Mr. Fletchers\nlour kind letter ©f congratulations on the Jeffersonian Heritage series\nis a source of satisfaction to m©fl and I know it will be gratifying\nto th© members of the Adult Education Cenmitte© and also to MSB board\nmembers. On their behalf9 1 should like to express our groat apprecia¬\ntion for your support and commendation.\nYour praise is appreciated all the more because the project of pione©r-\ning a great deal of new quality radio programs proved to be one of\nconsiderable difficulty. I found that we were really trying to pro¬\nduce \"consumer durables** in the field of drama and public affairs\nprograms that would have the drama quality of Sherwood*® \"Abraham\nLincoln in Illinois** and would have the scholarship authenticity\nfor a continuing usefulness • As you can see by glancing at the memor¬\nandum reporting the meeting of th© Russian consultants to appraise the\nprograms in the USSR series, this i® a difficult process.\nWith the invaluable support of the FAE, we have been able*, for the first\ntime 5 to bring into the field of educational radio a combination of\nloading academecians and the best professional talent. Our constant\neffort has been for importance and integrity of content and form. I\nbelieve that we have shown that important academic subject matter can\nbe listenable and exciting for the mass radio audience. I am sure that\nthe other series*, about to b® released9 will be praised by the critics\nalso.\n1 hope that your suggestion of a faceting will be possible in the near\nfuture.\nThanking you again*, I am\nfey cordially yours,\nGeorge Probat\nChairman* Adult Education Committee\nNUSB\nGP/jk"
