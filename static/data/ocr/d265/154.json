Adams' reputation\nsurvived the ordeal at the time, hut a quarter of a century later, when he was a\ncandidate for President, his political foes sought to discredit him by reviving\nthis story.\nArgument\nThis radio program differs from the others in that the part played by Jeffer¬\nson is chiefly that of narrator while John Adams is the main actor.
