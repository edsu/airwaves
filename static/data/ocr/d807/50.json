I’d like Sd Burrovs to serve as Gbairsaan* Ck, Bd?\nOne reason I*m working in advance is that I don’t care for the iisual\ntype of resolutions we have. Xhese could, I think^be very significant.\nXhe Chairman should check with Citations & Awards CoDsnittee Chairman\nSchooley for possible overlap in case of possible resolutions of thanks\nor recognition. Xhe Convention Cocsoittee, Hotel, IS^dilbitors, and possibly\nothers should have resolixtions of thanks. But we need more if possible\nfor presentation at the banquet (with Citations Coonittee}. Xhere can be\na little levity.\nOne area for a possible resolution: In our foreign aid bills, telecocmuni*\ncations are left out. Yet in underdeveloped nations this could be one of\ngreatest boons to education and literacy. A deelamtion of our concern for\nsuch world problems, and an urging for inclusion of aid in setting up systems\nwould be of use. (One fe.Gtory in one country may cost $6 mllUon. Ife could\nhelp a dosen idiole countries with educational radio and TV for that, for\nexample.)"
