I intend to take part of mine next\nweek. Going first to Chicago then to Fond du Lac to\nvisit my parents.\nRight now Pm thinking about the convention. Any¬\nthing youfd like done? Information? Research? Letters\nto be written? Arrangement s*> Or whatever....\nYou should know, I think, that there is a very slim\nchance I won’t be able to make it. (That’s one reason 1\nthought there might be something you’d want from me now.)\nOur travel funds have got quite skinny. However, Harold\nHill tells me not to worry—the greatest odds are I’ll\nbe able to go.\nHow did you like that pile of audition tapes? The\nair around here has turned blue, and it ain’t cigarette\nsmoke. It’s Hill inventing dirty words.\nI look forward to a Fort-Hayes-Restaurant-style com¬\nmittee meeting in New York.\nBest regards,\nSincerely,\nJH:cp\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager"
