The specific references are localized, of course,\nbut the \"kit\" is enclosed for your consideration as an idea that might\nfind adaptability to your own community.\n*****\nEnclosure #3 is the brochure prepared by WAMU-FM to promote its\nspecial series THE VOICES OF POVERTY; it is an excellent example of\ncreative imagination at work on that \"extra\" step that adds so much\nto a total package presentation.\n* * * * *\nNEXT WEEK: A look at external program sources, NERN in particular."
