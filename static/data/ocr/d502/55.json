Hull\nI have noted with interest your memorandum of April 20 with respect\nto Mr. Novik and the announcement of the availability of his services,\ntogether with a confidential memorandum to NAEB active members.\nI have also noted your letter copy of April 20 addressed to Mr. Novik\nand I am reacting specifically to paragraph four.\nMy opinion remains that the problem however presently restricted\nlocally will not continue. An intelligent approach involves an¬\nticipating difficulties in the future and making plans to solve\nthem in the best way possible. In the consultant relationship\nwhich has been established for Mr. Novik I see no problem in attack¬\ning this.\nIf I am in error about the absence of the problem I nonetheless agree\nwith the statement of Board member Hunter at Columbus—that either we\nhad better face up to this problem or else stifle our concerns about\nsome other agency undertaking to handle it. (Specific reference is\nmade to the voiced annoyance in several quarters about the fact that\nthe JCET first employed Novik for the same purpose. In other words,\nwe either get on the horse or off the horse, and if we have decided\nto walk we had better not complain of not being able to ride.)\nI approve the idea of a general meeting where consistent policy can\nbe formulated for the activity which will ensue."
