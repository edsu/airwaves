I think that yon should use\nyour own judgment so far as the membership list is concerned*\nObviously, the membership is constantly changing, and if you\nwere to include all member stations it would take up an awful\nlot of space. I agree with Dick that the lists of members is\nan impressing factor, but I think maybe we have outgrown the\nnecessity for including a complete list*\nYour figure of 1500 copies is excellent, and if you have 500\nat the Institute that will be wonderful.\nI am not in a position to get a letter out to all HAS® members\nconcerning the Columbus meeting. This is basically a function\nof the IERT. If you are in a position to wend a letter out\ncalling attention to our luncheon and to the special program\nunder our sponsorship on Friday night, it might be extremely\neffective.\nI am formally extending an invitation to Miss Hennock to speak\nat the luncheon despite an objection voiced by Probst* He\nsngg ested Paul Hoffman, but I have not received a reply to my\ntelegraphed invitation. We can discuss further details of the\nluncheon at the Board of Directors meeting on May 1st. I presume\nyou will be able to handle all of the details, and I am certain\nthat Schooley will be able to\nsns:L\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
