Skomla\nDATE; May 12, 1954\ndJ (jj\nSUBJECTS: Various\ni\nThe attached letter to Novik speaks for itself. It’s as I was requested\nby Graydon to drajw up, but with various generalities reduced to specifics,\nI do feel that the fears of one or fcvo people have had so much effect on\nthe situation now, that NovikHs value to us is likely to be virtually nil. Herewith\nquotations from 2 recent notes from Morris;\n(1) \"My Dear Harry;\nYou have covered the understanding that you,\nGraydon and I had -■ thoroughly and accurately.\nAs far as I am concerned 9 it is o,kt>/ and I\nwill await further instructions.*\n(2) ,rHaving said what I did about your May 4th Memo, I\nthink I ought to tell you in confidence about one\nset-back that I have had.. Due to my desire to live\nup to the letter and your prohibition about possible\nNational negotiations,\nX think I have told you that the top IBEW people\nof Los Angeles and San Francisco, St» Louis, etc,\nhave been meeting in Washington for the past couple\nof weeks. Hardy, the top Washington man, arranged\nfor an informal luncheon session to g$v© me a\nchance to explain the problem of the educational\nstation* I was so anxious to avoid any possible.\nviolation of the spirit of the Columbus decision,\nthat I cancelled the session and of course missed\nthe opportunity of having the sympathetic attitude\nof L.Ae> San Francisco and Hardy help break down\nSt< Louis which, as you know, is a hard nut tc crack.98\nUnless this is to be reduced to an impossible situation of Tearfulness,\nI think we should best drop it. I therefore hereby request authorization for\nMorrie to engage in informal conversations of the sort mentioned above, which will\nbe to the long-term advantage of all, I think all unions who read and listen now\nknow there is such a thing as educational TV and the best presentation of our\nsituation would be one presented by us rather than someone else, ✓\nThe reaction (and in essence vote) of all officers, to Graydon with copy\nto me (if this is o.k* with him) is urgently needed, as well as your reaction to\nmy May 10. note re meeting. I now believe this meeting should include Schenkkan and\nGpggin as well as a.few Directors at least9 so that various sides of the problem\ncan be threshed out. Personally l*m willing to lose a member if necessary\n(ScheukkaUj. you may recall threatened this on behalf ex' we -'even talked11\nto unions) rather than being \"babes in the wood” a few years from nov. May X hear\nfrom you (besides Hulland Dunn who are already firm and clear)1."
