Such assistance, however, should remain within the realm of possi¬\nbility, When such developments are’undertaken, with or without United States\nsupport, they should be facilitated\"by the willingness of ICA to provide\ntechnical training for members of the staffs of such systems, and/or the\nexecution of feasibility studies and surveys,\nICA policy should permit assisting the installation of large scale\ntelevision stations and national systems where special circumstances warrant.\nThe special psychological or political circumstances justifying such developments\nin television would include} actual or imminent threat of major Bloc country\naction in this area of development, the need for a particularly dramatic\nproject to protect the stability of an existing government, or an unusually\ninsistent demand for such development by-a key figure controlling an existing\nfriendly government®\nIn a field as fluid as television, and in a world wherein profound\nchanges can occur with great r^nidity, ICA?s policy in regard to television\ndevelopment must remain flexible. Such policy should be reconsidered on.an\nannual basis.\nIt is believed that the indicated policy guidelines provide ICA\nwith the means for active participation in the development of television\nfacilities around the world, with that participation based on a reasoned\npolicy *p©sition that is solidly rooted in the best available evidence.\nIt is recommended that the attached statement be adopted as guideline\npolicy for the consideration of assistance in the development of television\nresources, and that this statement be circulated to appropriate offices and\nall USOMs,\n-7 -"
