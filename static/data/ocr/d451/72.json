  "text": "- 3 -\nREQUEST FOR AN AMENDEMNT AND EXTENSION\nThe ori4,inal contract Is scheduled to end on August 31> 1964* The NAEB\nrequests now that the contract be amended to extend this period until\nJune 30, 1965. A small budget extension to cover personnel costs during\nthis period is the only additional expense involved, and there is reason\nto believe that the benefits to be derived from extending the project are\nsubstantial.\nThis request for amendment is necessitated by roughly seven months of\nnegotiations on earlier contract changes and amendments that were requested\nby the Advisory Coamnittee, and in principle, felt by the Office of Education\nto be worthwhile suggestions. The delays were not the fault of any one\nof the parties to the contract, but a result of the lengthy discussion\nand negotiation which \\mre required to assure that changes were necessary\nand that they were being presented and execute! in an effective manner.\nThe delays have, however, made it necessary to adjust the schedule of the\nproject and it is for this reason that this request is being submitted.\nThe Office of Education has already approved, in principle, an extension\nof this project to cover at least the period of time during which the\nfilms will be produced. By agreement with the Office of Education, the\nUniversity of Texas, and the National Association of Educational BroadÂ¬\ncasters, the last film to be produced should be finished on April 1, 1965*\nThis alone would require an amendment to cover the time between August 31^\n1964, and April 1, I965. An extension to June 30, I965, however, is\nrequested to allow for ccmpletion of the kit material for the final film\nand a conclusion of the production phases of the project. A short period\noriginally requested for evaluation of the materials is not being sought\nas part of this extension inasmuch as this would require an additional\nthree to four months to complete.\nBUDGET\n(See Attached Sheet)"
