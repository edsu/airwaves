But these names are not the names of anything. They are\nnot even synonyms. They are not equivalent* Each has a special flavor of\nmeaning to each of us, and probably no one of these words means exactly the\nsame to all of us* Such a formidable choice of names poses my subject in\nthe form of a question: What is the role of a national association?\nIn the first place comes the fact that these names all share the adjective,\n“National, “ I suppose that this offers but another instance of the fact\nthat we live in an era of intense nationalism, so the word, “National,\" re¬\nassures us all, suggesting unity, loyalty, safety and power, scope and in¬\nfluence, largeness if not grandeur.

These types are not mu¬\ntually exclusive? they usually march on each other and at times overlap or\nblend. So perhaps it would be better to say that national organizations\npresent a graded scale or gradual spectrum, whose two extremes have the\nfollowing characteristics:\nAt one end are those national associations whose purposes and interests are\nso specialized, and whose protagonists and champions so few, that only by\ndrawing upon the whole nation can they hope to assemble an effective band of\nenthusiasts. Hence the word, \"National,\" Their purpose is to stimulate a\nnationwide interest in their programs, to advertise, to evangelize and make\n♦Presented at the annual banquet of the National Association for Mental\nHealth, New York City, October 24, 195^*"
