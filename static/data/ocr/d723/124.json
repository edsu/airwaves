However, a station cannot subscribe to the in-school\nservice without taking the full service of the Network# Several of our\nmember station®, operated by school systems, do not operate during the\nmsaaer months* They are therefore permitted to take the regular offerings\nduring three quarters of the year, plus the in-school offerings, without\nthe payment of an additional fee for the use of the in-school programs*\nYou will notice that the annual assessment fee amounts to very small\ncharge per hour of programing received (Approximately! Class A - $1*00,\nClass B - #.63, Class C - #*38, for the first year), although we do not\npermit stations to be billed at an hourly rate for programs used — they\nmust pay the entire annual assessment whether they use all or only a part\nof the offerings made by the network*\nIn addition, stations must pay postage for tapes received from, and shipped\nback to, the Network. For a station in your locality this will amount to\napproximately #120*00 a year, if you used approximately all of the tapes\nmade available*\nIf after you've had a chance to look over the materials I'm sending you\nhave any questions, please let me know, and we would be glad to consider\nthe Buckner Orphans Home's application for membership.\nSincerely,\nHarold £• Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHtJy\nEnclosures ^\nccs Miss Marguerite Fleming\nDireetcr-NAEB Region Y"
