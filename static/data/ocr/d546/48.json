Axford\nAssociate Director\nInformal Instructional Services\nUniversity Extension Division\nThe University of Wisconsin\n606 West Wisconsin Avenue\nMilwaukee 3, Wisconsin\nDear Rogers\nAt last I have gotten back to your letter and the presentation on\nMr. Lighty.\nThis interests ms very such fear publication in the journal—but for a\nnational audience I think it would need rewriting, accenting the\n\"pioneering\" more and tbs Wisconsin personalities less. Also, for this\ntype of article, Ifd prefer it about half as long as the present one*\nIf you can find the time to rewrite along those lines, I would very much\nlike to see it again. We have had requests from tins to time for this\ntype of article dealing with key personalities in educational broad¬\ncasting.\nAgain, thanks very much for thinking of us. And I hope to hear ftm\nyou soon—in the affirmative.\nBest regards.\n(ftrs.) Betty MsKenzie\nPublications Editor\nSC/dp\nblcct Walter B. Emery\nHarold E. Ell (/\""
