I am in favor of a citation for Siegel*\n3* I am in favor of citations for Stanton and Bullitt-\nprovided you recognize at least one educator of the\ntype represented say by the personality of Arthur Adams.\nPublic relations-wise all commercial recognition is un¬\nwise in my opinion. Possibly Siegel and McCarty are the\nanswers to my criticism*\n1*. I am against the recognition of Storer and/or the Okla¬\nhoma broadcaster who gave Dunn's outfit help, UNLESS you\nget several more such men and (based on advice from Steetle)\ndo a kind of across-the-board-recognition so that the\nprinciple of saluting a number of commercial broadcasters\nfor this activity is recognized, e. g. that we don't adorn\none or two who had private reasons for their beneficence.\n5. Yes for McCarty.\nI suggest the headquarters re-review all of these names after votes\nare in so too many citations don't cheapen the recognition.\nSincerely,\nRichard B.\nDirector, i\n► Hull._-\nRegion IV\ncc-NAEB Board (except Siegel)"
