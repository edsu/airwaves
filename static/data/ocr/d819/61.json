I now raise some questions. Xou understand,\ns'ir, that I»m simply raising questions; 1‘m not\nobjecting to anything. If we subscribe, should it be\nfor (A), (B), or (O? And, no matter which, do\nyou still think it worth it for HAEB? And even if\nyou do, would it not be wise to bring the matter\nup for discussion with executive committee again?\nHot that it hasn*t technically been decided, but\nbecause of the sum involved? Or, do you feel the\nmatter is more urgent, and X should proceed to\norder?\nRelated to the question of which part of ser¬\nvice, (A), (B), or (G), might be Just parts what\nheadquarters will be getting.\nAgain, sir, no objections; I*m Just raising\nquestions.\nRegards,\nFESjfmh\nFrank E. Schooley\nStation Manager"
