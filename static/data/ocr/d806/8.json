Griffiths\nDirector of Hass .Media\n9Xli East Green Street\nPasadena, California\nDear Bllli\nOw Hkm Executive Consrrdttee, meeting in Wbana last\nweek, discussed at considerable length, with Wilbur Schramm\nand as a committee, some of the most obvious needs for trained\npersonnel in educational television stations and explored a\nnumber of possibilities.\nJim Miles will draw together our ideas on the subject\nand will take them up with Wilbur and Bob for their reaction\nand they in turn will probably present these ideas to the\ncommittee on scholarships, fellowships, etc. for their considera¬\ntion. This would seem to be a simpler plan and a more efficient\nway of handling the whole question of the training of educational\nn personnel than attempting to set up a separate program.\nWe discussed at considerable length the seminar on\neducational television and conceive of it as a part of the\nbroader aspects of readiness for launching tbs educational sta¬\ntions across tbs country. 1 asked Jim to spend some time on this\nseminar and come up with some recommendations in the very near\nfuture. You may expect to hear from us soon concerning it. Wt\nare particularly eager to get a date for the seminar set so we\nmay begin shaping up plans for it. Late May or early June would\nappear to be the most desirable time in light of the unusual\namount of activity everyone ia currently Involved in in respect\nto television development on the local levels. We conceive of\nthis seminar aa a vital and necessary prelude to the launching\nof the stations for our seminar should give direction and leaning\nto all of our future activities in this field. We are most\ngratefbl indeed for tha cooperation of the Fund for Adult Education\nin making this seminar possible.\nI send this along in the hope of clearing up any Ma-\nunderstandlng that might have arisen earlier."
