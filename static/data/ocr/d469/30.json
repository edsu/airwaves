As proposed, the assurance would be required that\nan applicant which is otherwise superficially eligible as a nonptofit\ncorporation is so organized as to be reasonably representative of the\neducational cultural and civic groups in the community to be served, and\nfree from control by a single private entity.\nAnother one to look for is a proposed new assurance that the amount of\nthe non-Federal share indicated in the application is the maximum amount\navailable to the applicant. This, of course, relates to the legislative\nhistory in the excerpts from the House Report included among your papers.\nBriefly it will mean (if it is included in the final regulations) that\nafter determining estimated total project costs, an applicant will file a\nspecific assurance that the amount represented as the applicant's share of\nthe project is the maximum which he can raise from non-Federal sources.\nThis would also be the applicant's share of the final total project costs,\nand would be applied to final costs before determining the final amount of\nthe grant."
