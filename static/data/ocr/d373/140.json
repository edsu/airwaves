That\nFCC's various divisions can provide some valuable\nassistance to communities, and to individuals\nwho bear the responsibility for planning the use\nof such systems.\nThe most significant contribution which the FCC\ncan make to the efforts we are describing here\nlies in this critical area of professional guidance\nin the uses and values of mass communications\nsystems.\nIn some regions of the country, only one source\nof electrical power exists which provides services\nto rural areas. For example, the REA (Rural Elec¬\ntrification Agency) a division of the U. S. Dept,\nof Agriculture, provides the only source of elec¬\ntrical power for the rural areas of Appalachia.\nREA came into being with the emergence of the TVA\n(Tennessee Valley Authority) as a reality."
