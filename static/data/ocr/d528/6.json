Incidentally,\nwe are, or soon will be, a \"qualifying\" CPB station, so the\namendment would apply to us.\nOn another subject, the Memo to Managers (dated May 29) refers,\nin the section \"FCC Amends Rules Relating To Financial Support,\"\nto a Memo to Managers dated May 15. We did not receive that\none for some reason. We would appreciate your sending us a\ncopy and the Memorandum Opinion and Order mentioned. Many\nthanks.\nCR/cd\nCharles Rasberry f\\\nDirector of Broadcasting"
