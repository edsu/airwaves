Health per¬\nhaps to follow. However* the Committee agrees that other considerations may\nwell dictate a wholly different ardor*\nIt will bs noted that the budget for each is within the sum we under^\nstand to be available* 3h all cases this represents a reduction from originally\nrecamoandsd sums. W6 believe good programs can result on the basis outlined.\nOur sincere thanks for the opportunity o? presenting these proposals\nfor your consideration.
