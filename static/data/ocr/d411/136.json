Becker\nDirector, Division of TV-Radio-?ilm\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nKeith tells me that you will not he able to attend the Institute this year.\nI am very sorry to hear this because I looked forward to seeing you again,\nand also because I am stuck with the chairmanship of the clinic. I thought\nyou would be interested in knowing what we have planned.\nWe have decided to center the discussion around the four following areas:\n1. Significant recent research in U. S. commercial broadcasting.\n2. A review of the NAEB seminar on educational broadcast research.\n3. Recent developments in CBC research.\n4. A report on the outstanding broadcast research study completed\nwithin the past year.\nBor point #2, if it meets with your approval, I plan to ask Ken Harwood to\nreview the WEB seminar.\nI might note that we do not plan to bill point #4 as the outstanding broad¬\ncast study, but will simply have a study reported on. I would be most happy\nto receive by return mail your suggestion as to which study should be pre¬\nsented.\nSincerely,\nIrving R. Merrill\nDirector of Television Research\nIEM/edm"
