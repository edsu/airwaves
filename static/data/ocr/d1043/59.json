I called a meeting of the Executive Committee for\nFebruary 20 in Chicago in order to get rid of some of our\nbusiness so that we,would be less involved at the time of the\nOhio State Institute. Copies of separate memoranda and minutes\nof Secretary Harley covering the meeting are enclosed.\n2. As a result of our meeting I also discussed with\nLenny Marks some of our problems and confirmed our understanding\nin writing. For your information I am enclosing a copy of my\nletter to Lenny.\n3. At the present time I am hoping that the Board\ncan do all of its business in a one-day session prior to the\nInstitute. Also, I’m hoping that prior to the meeting I can\nget you an agenda along with some accompanying memoranda\nwhich we might wish to consider.\nU* With this mailing there is a ballot on number 5\n(Item $) on which you are requested to vote. Most of you are\naware of the difficulty we have had in getting this project\nwound up. I know of no other way except to take the bull by\nthe horns and throw it.\n5. Prior to the Institute you’ll receive some\nsuggestions and comments regarding the proposed renewal of a\nKellogg project. This I consider to be one of our most important\nitems' of^ business.\n6. Unfortunately, because of illness. Bob Coleman was\nunable to get to Chicago although he had planned to until the\nlast minute."
