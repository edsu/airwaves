C.\nDecember 23, 1959\nDr. Harry Skornia, President\nNational Association df Educational\nBroadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nIt was good to see you again last week, even though briefly,'\nand your presence was, as usual, the generator of some thinking. One\nof the objects of cerebration was the McLuhan project and we wish now\nthat there had been more time to discuss this with you.\nThe office file, and our brief conversation, and talks which I\nhave had with Dr. Stone indicate that Phase I of the project is at or\nnear completion and that a decision concerning continuation is about\ndue. Would you be good enough to check the project status and let\nus know of the NAEB Research Committee's recommendations concerning\nfuture work on this project?\nWe received information from Fiscal Management indicating that\na check for $15,000 was prepared on the fourteenth and mailed to you.\nThis money would, I believe, represent the better portion of the\nFederal support for project Phase II, if the decision is to continue.\nIf, on the other hand, there is to be no continuation, then we must\nplan for a final accounting and redeploy the resources.\nWe will appreciate your help and advice.\nSincerely yours.\nWarren F. Seibert\nSenior Research Coordinator\nEducational Media Branch"
