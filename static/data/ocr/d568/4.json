Not only is the NAEB facing a financial crisis,\nbut the whole system of public broadcasting is under severe\nstress and possible subversion. The response of the licensees\nto this menace to their independence and to the integrity of\nthe system has been to throw the governing board chairmen\ninto the breach and, meanwhile, try to set up a single\norganization to speak for the licensees, using the clout of\nprestigious laymen.\nThe establishment of a single organization - either a merger\nor amalgam of existing agencies - clearly affects the NAEB\nand its future; hence, it also affects budget and plans for\nwhich budget is the blueprint.\nThe budget presentation also reveals the problems of operating\nthe Association as a central structure and yet permitting\nfiscal autonomy for its independent segments.\nThese two topics are the only matters that should concern us:\nthe plans for the new structuring of public broadcasting and\ntheir relation to NAEB and how the Association keeps functioning,\nuntil, if, or instead of the establishment of such an\norganization.\nIn my own view, the establishment of a single voice for the\nTV licensees, at least, can be done and must be done. If we\nblow this opportunity, we will not only miss a chance to\ndevelop a new level of significance and power for public\nbroadcasting but, worse, we will confirm the fears of our\nfriends in Congress and the foundations that we are indeed\nimmune to leadership, that we can not put our house in order,\nthat we cannot unite in common effort and act in concert and.\naccord."
