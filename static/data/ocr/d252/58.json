MAXIMUM)^\nI'd like to turn our attention to something beautiful and\nat the same time uniquely Japanese: the bonkei or miniature\nlandscapes mounted on trays. Among the many fascinating things\nwhich one notices especially in the villages of Japan are\nthese bonkei in shop windows. These artificial landscapes,\nsmall but perfect in detail, are often copies of an actual\nscene. Here to tell us more about the bonkei is K0 TAKEUAKA.\nBonkei landscapes consist of some kind of earthlike material\nwhich forms the foundation, the plains, the hills, and\nmountains. Vie find pebbles and sands, moss, small living\n(or artificial) trees and plants representing the flora, while\nthe fauna as well as the little human figures and buildings\nare made of baked clay.\nFor the making of tray landscapes comparatively few implements\nare necessary. One, two, or three, differently shaped and\nsized spatulas are the most important tools. These are to\nthe modeller what the brush is to the painter.\nSmall sieves are used in connection with the laying of different\nkinds of pebbles and sands. Three types of brushes serve\nfor putting color on the mountains and rocks; to smooth the\nsurface of hills; and to clean pieces of unwanted material"
