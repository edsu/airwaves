Mott, Executive Director,\nNational Educational Radio\nSubject: Future Role of NER Network (Redraft of August 5 document)\nThe Holt Public Radio Study reiterates a key element concerning\neducational (public) radio. The study says educational radio lacks\nsubstance, system, structure and organization.\nThe CPB Radio Advisory Council reached certain conclusions at\nits meeting in Madison, Wisconsin on duly 31 and August 1* These\nconclusions identify the future role of NER*s Network.\nNERN would continue as a taped program service tentatively\nidentified as NER/PS in this document.\nNER/PS would continue to function as a radio tape program library.\nIt would continue to duplicate and distribute taped radio programs.\nSources for programs would include domestic station productions,\nprograms taped from the NPR live network, audio tracks of TV programs\nfor CPB supported productions, instructional programs, materials from\ninternational sources (coordination between NER/PS and NPR would be\nrequired here), the current materials available at NERN and at BFA.\nIn addition, the library would include material from other sources\ngenerally available without production or use costs.\nNER/PS would not be a production agency but minimal production\nmay be necessary and desirable on a limited basis. Generally, NER/PS\nwould limit its activity to the concept of taped delayed broadcast\nprogramming.\nGenerally, NER/PS would not Initiate program production or provide\nfunds for production of programs."
