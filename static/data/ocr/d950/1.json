Should he want to consult with a\nrepresentative of the research committee on questionnaire design, etc.,\nI think this would be most appropriate.\nThe systematic collection of factual information is an important activity,\nand it is to be hoped that many of the committees will have occasion to\ndo so. If all such projects were to be funneled through the research\ncommittee we would end up a bottleneck rather than a facilitating committee.\nSincerely,\nIrving R.
