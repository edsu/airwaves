Burton Pculm\nRadio Station IOJOU\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nDear Burtons\nThanks for your note, the flier on the fall meeting, and\nthe revised list of members. I have had the material for the\nbrochure in Si*s hands a couple of weeks but he has not yet\nreturned it. He feels that we should have an up-to-date list\nwhereas Griffith thinks it would not be desirable to do so. I\nshould appreciate your vote on the subject.\nAs for the convention, I vote for Friday, Saturday, and\nSunday—three days should be enough—and suggest you reserve\nall of the Center’s sleeping accomodations. I believe we’ll\nhave at least sixty-six people registered and I, for one, feel\nthat we can and should ignore the football game* It is too\nfar for most of us to travel to waste time seeing a football\ngams after we.gget there. I can’t afford to be away from home\nany more than is absolutely necessary to take care of business\nCongratulations upon the last Newsletter. It was indeed\nexcellent. You continue to amaze me by your efficiency.\nSincerely yours.\nGraydon Ausraus,\nVice-President\nHA33B\nGA/ns\nenc* 1"
