I will take up the matters you presented\nin your letter in the order in which you stated them.\nFirst, I agree that it would be good to line up contact people at the\nuniversities sponsoring summer workshops and I will st at the matter\nright away an I let you have the names of the contacts as fast as I get\nthem. I think this is a great idea.\nNext, let’s pass up, at least for the nonce, Mamet*s ideas for the com¬\nmunity workshops and the awards. I will tell Mamet that we already have\nthe descriptive brochure.\nThere certainly is a person that can do a better article on station pro¬\nmotion than me. It is a member of our committee. Miss Marion Cornell,\nHenry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan. If you\nwill write Marion and tell her that I wanted her to do this and thought\nshe was the best person on the committee to do so, I am sure that she\nwill come through with something very well done.\nCordially yours.\nElmer 0. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\ncci Mr. Harold Hill"
