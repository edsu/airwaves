It was clearly the intent\nof my motion %o establish a committee of three on\nInternational Negotiations. You will recall that\nthere was a fairly vigorous exchange between Sy\nand George on the division of the field of activi¬\nties. By establishing a committee of three X was\nputting the determination of possible conflict in\nfront of tiie new ^resident so that he could listen\nto the discussions pro and con and decide on the\nmerits of each such case.\nThe likelihood is that in the actual opera-\nt -ana .. wiII have few such conflicts.\nX think tiie distinction is sufficiently clear,\nhowever, by tbs mare section and that which is re¬\nported to require a modification of the minute®,\nif the other member® of the board concur in my\nmemory of what occurred.\nCordially yours.\nAllen Miller, Director\nRegion VI\nAMtgb\nccj Members of the Board\nGeorge Probst\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
