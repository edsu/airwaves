Hull\nDirector of Radio and TV Broadcasting\nOhio State University\n215 West Nineteenth Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio\nDear Dick,\nWe have set up a preliminary meeting with the RCA people in\nWashington on July 7, We plan to meet for lunch in the Saddle\nand Sirloin Room of the Marriott Motor Hotel and then spend two\nor three hours in having a look at the whole Burns proposal and\nmaking some determinations on how to begin and where. I have\nstressed in conversations with Mr. Wentworth, the man in charge\nof the educational electronics division of RCA, that some things\nneed to be shored up in NAEB before we can move ahead very sub¬\nstantially with the Big Dream. He agrees This may mean that\nwe can get some kind of underwriting to help us get this thing on\nthe road and put us in a position to effectively staff such an under¬\ntaking.\nYou, as Chairman of the Board, and for a multiplicy of other reasons,\nought to be present, if possible. I know you are having to run down\nto Washington quite a lot and are getting pretty tired of it, but I\nthink this is an important date and I hope you can manage to be present.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:kfm"
