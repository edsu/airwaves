  "text": "December 5, 1957\nFact Sheets are priced at 10$ each or $&5S© for all those issued during\nthe year. All though our supply is low, I believe we can furnish you\nwith the back issues for the years 1955 and 1956 (and of course, this\nyear). As of January, 1958 the Fact Sheets will be incorporated into\nthe NAEB Journal and will no longer be mimeographed. The subscription\nprice at this time will be $4.00 per year.\nThe Fact Sheets are an effort to digest and centralize available research\nprincipally on the effectiveness of radio and television as instructional\ntools. The Sheets are issued as a continuing series at irregular inter¬\nvals .\nIf you desire more information, please let us know.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gans\nSecretary\nP. S. Iam also enclosing a listing of our materials which are available.\nPerhaps you will find something of interest listed.\nEnclosures ®"
