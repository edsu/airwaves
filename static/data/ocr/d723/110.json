Maclin, Jr.\nDirector, Radio-Television\nMississippi Southern College\nStation A, Box 52\nHattiesburg, Mississippi\nDear Mr. Maclin*\nReference is made to your letter of October 11, requesting information about the\npossibility of Active membership in the NA3SB for your wirednwireless station, WMSU.\nAs Mrs. Etryner pointed out in her letter of October 15, such stations are not\neligible for Active membership, such membership being restricted to actual educa¬\ntional, non-commercial broadcast stations. I am enclosing a few brief items which\ngive some information at»ut t^ie Association and which more clearly explain the\nclassifications of membership.\nI would guess that Mississippi Southern College does not do regular educational\nbroadcasting over a coonarcial station, and therefore would not be eligible for\nAssociate membership. However, the College would be eligible for Affiliate\nmembership, and I am enclosing an application blank for your use in applying for\nsuch membership. As a EBmber-based organization all applications must be approved\nby the Membership e omit tee and the Board of Directors and such action takes\nseveral weeks. Therefore, if you would like for me to return the check for $15*00,\nwhich you mention is being forwarded, 1*11 be happy to do so. On the other hand,\nif you would like for us to hold the check until your membership is approved, we\nwill do that} and since Affiliate membership is only $10.00 a year, we could apply\nthe extra $5*00 to next year's dues (1958).\nUnder separate cover I am sending you some examples of the types of reports, surveys,\netc., which we issue for our membership from time to time, and we are looking forward\nto your application for membership. If, in the meantime, we can be of any service,\nplease do not hesitate to let me know.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
