This is strange and has many serious implications.\nIt appears that FAE will permit such a meeting to be held, stand by while the blood\nflows freely, ignore the dead bodies and then bind up the wounds of their favorites.\nIf possible, I would insist that FAE be present and moderate. There’s the well\nknown ’’nigger in the woodpile here”. Watch them very closely, Mr. President $\n5. With the economy trend in educational circles become tighter, I don’t see how\nwe dare raise anything — dues, network fees or anything else. My budget for 1954-55\nis the same as this year. If anything is increased in the way of NAEB fees, it will\nmean that we will simply have to take it away from another vital function of the\nstations ( if we can afford to do so). We have cut back on so many important aspects\nof our operations that our efftiveness has been pretty well dulled. In some direc¬\ntions we have been thoroughly emasculated. I wish I could be more helpful along\nthis line. Maybe I will get an idea in the midst of our Gethsemane.\nIn conclusion, I would urge that every economy be practiced at Headquarters, that\nwe make every effort to pull ourselves out of the hole. It may be that this will\ntake several years to do so. I don’t think we’re going to receice any aid. I hope\nI’m wrong.\nAs ever\n/"
