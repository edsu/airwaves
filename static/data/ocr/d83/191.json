  "text": "Mr. McLuhan\nJanuary 26, 1960\nPage 2\nWe also talked at our Chicago meeting last September of using some\nstandardized tests and some personality tests. I think that this\nshould still be done. Somehow, though, I would be very much\nbothered - and I am sure that anyone who reads the new proposal\nwill be - by a study which proposes to test the effects of something\nif they do not have some fairly specific idea of the effects which\nthey are trying to achieve.\nYou might be interested in the reaction to your last mailing on your\ngrade XX lecture and discussion sessions. This came from one member\nof the research committee.\nAlthough 1 did not undertake to edit the several pages in\nj detail, I noted the fact that certain elements seemed\nespecially difficult for secondary school students. You\nrealize, of course, that I have no information concerning\nplans for testing and evaluating whatever it is that is\n\\ going to be measured. My impression is that this will be\nlargely a matter of value judgments of a subjective nature.\nAm I correct? If so, is this an acceptable procedure?\nIf not, where do we go from here?\nI would think that at least some of the goals ought to be related to\nthe out-of-school behavior of these students. Do their reading and\nviewing and listening habits change? If so, in what ways? For how\nlong? Perhaps a sample of them could be induced to keep diaries\nof their media behavior - starting before the course and continuing\nfor some time after the course - including not only their exposure\nto media but their reactions to them. This, too, could be an im¬\nportant learning experience as well as a source for data. These\ncould be content analyzed. Again, this is not a very rigid sort of\nmethod but, in the early stages of such research, should be a hypo¬\nthesis generator.\nSLB:ks\nCC: Skornia, Ellery, Evans, Harwood"
