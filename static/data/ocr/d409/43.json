  "text": "6\na public relations act*\nPublic Service Function\nColleges and universities are inextricably bound up with their communities\nand service areas. To advance the quality of living in their localities, insti¬\ntutions of higher learning provide certain public services.\nThe audio-visual center is in a position to provide consultative assist¬\nance and to make certain of its facilities and materials available for off-campus\nuse. In some colleges the income from small fees charged for such off-campus\nservices makes possible the maintenance of a much larger materials collection\nthan would be possible otherwise. Such an arrangement may be advantageous to\nboth the public and the university.\nMajor Areas of Activity\nThe procedures thru which audio-visual materials and equipment can be\nrequested, obtained, and used may look very simple to an outsider. Indeed,\nfrom the point of view of the user, these procedures should be free of compli¬\ncations. To give efficient service, however, many behind-the-scene activities\nmust take place methodically and smoothly.\nThis section describes the activities which must go on if the center is\nto fulfil its functions. To an institution just beginning an audio-visual\nservice program, many of the activities and jobs to be done may seem extensive\nand even unimportant. Experience shows, however, that the activities suggested\nin this section are essential to insure the most common services demanded by\nfaculties.\nA study of the function charts (Pig. _, ___) will show how two institutions\npicture their organization of services. Appendix B gives four case studies of\naudio-visual services, one in a teachers college, one in a liberal arts college,\none of an AV center in a university, and one of a library-centered AV program\nin a university."
