Becker\nDivision of Television, Radio, Film\nUniversity of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam,\nIt appears unlikely that I will be at the NAEB Meeting\nsince unless I am definitely on the program there is no\nparticular reason that I would ordinarily attend. I\nbelieve Roy Barthold will be there, however, if there\nis anything that you might like to pass along to me\nresulting from the Research Committee’s Meeting.\nA lot of interesting findings are emerging from our\ncurrent Title VII Project. I will be interested in\nyour reactions to our final report.\nAs chairman of the APA-Division 2, ETV Committee, I am\nstill negotiating with Seth Spaulding concerning our\nproposed big scale conference dealing with learning\ntheory and the new communication media. At the moment,\nwe will be watching the Michigan State University Con¬\nference this fall for any possible overlap with our\nproposed conference.\nHave you considered the possibility of a Title VII\nProposal channeled through the NAEB Research Committee\nconcerning some problem such as the “Changing Image”\nof ETV nationally as a result of recent pronouncements\nsuch as those of Newton Minnow?\nAt any rate, Sam, keep in touch with me, and in the\nevent that something unexpected happens that I have to\nbe in Washington at the time of the NAEB Meetings, which\nis possible in terms of a proposal we’re negotiating with\nNSF, I would be delighted to be at the Tuesday, October 2hth,\n8:00 A.M. Committee Meeting.\nCordially yours.\nRIE:v\nRidhard I. Evans\nProfessor of Psychology\ncc: Roy E. Barthold"
