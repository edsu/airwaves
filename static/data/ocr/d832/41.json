Active Radio Members, Region I\nFROM: A1 Fredette, Director, Radio, Region I\nDATE: December 6, 1963\nThe main reason for accepting a nomination for a second term on the\nN.A.E.B. Radio Board in 1962 was because of my former role as Vice-Chairman\nfor Development of the Educational Radio Network. The philosophy was that\nthe interests of radio in the region might best be served by someone actively\ninvolved in both areas.\nAlthough the Educational Radio Network is still in existence on a limited\nbasis, the reorganization of the N.A.E.B. together with the emergence of the\nEducational Communications System, overshadows the previous situation.\nStill based on the foregoing philosophy, I am not accepting a nomination\nto the N.A.E.B. radio Board, but wish instead to nominate Jack Summerfield,\nManager of WRVR and Chairman of the Educational Communications Advisory\nCommittee.\nOver the years I have come to know and respect Jack and feel that he can\ndo the kind of a job necessary in furthering educational radio, both regionally\nand nationally. I strongly urge you to support him in the coming election.\nPlease let me make it clear that this does not indicate a lack of willingÂ¬\nness to serve educational broadcasting through the N.A.E.B. in any other\ncapacity. On the contrary, if there is any service I can perform for you\nindividually or for the N.A.E.B., I stand ready to be of service.\nFinally, I would like to say once again thank you'* for your past\ncooperation and support"
