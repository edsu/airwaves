Also, see no reason why you shouldn t\nappoint committee to get started on it. However, do\nbelieve we should not have any public notice at the\nmonk.at, such as announcement.\nI think the convention will work out all right.\nWe’ll just have to be a little definite at times. I\ntried my best and kindest to explain this to Marguerite\nthe other day. Then comes a misunderstanding through\nthe mails, and a number of pages which won’t help to\nget off dead center, but we can follow up at appropriate\ntime.\nIncidentally, have written Dr. Faust both regarding\nthe TV seminar and about consultation with him* No reply\nto either. He may have been out of town.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFES:nb\nCC: Skornla"
