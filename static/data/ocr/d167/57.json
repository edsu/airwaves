Kenneth Wright, Chairman Ed Burrows\nDear Kens\nThis is to suggest topics which seem to me to need discussing by\nthe radio fraternity at Tampa. I'm sure neither you nor the other\nmembers of the panel need such a list but to the extent this may\nreinforce or contradict your own views of what might usefully be\ndiscussed, it may be of some help. If you will distill an agenda\nfrom these and your own ideas, Ken; and from suggestions from the\nother members of the panel, which 1 hereby request they send you,\n1 think we will have more than we can handle both Friday afternoon\nand Saturday morning. In order to provide every opportunity for\ninformal as well as formal discussion, I 11 be sending out a notice\nshortly, as 1 indicated to you, setting a place for early arrivals\nto get together Friday morning to talk radio. I plan also a post¬\nbanquet get- ogether about which more later.\nX intend for the Saturday morning group to comprise a caucus of the\nwhole for the purpose of making some specific long range plans and\nrecommendations. Xt would help to have soundings on these matters\nfrom your Friday session. By these matters , 1 nave in minds\nWORKSHOPS\nThe need for workshops in production, in music, in pro¬\ngramming, in financing, in promotion, in program sources\nand program exchange. It is a tired thing to say, but\nthere is not enough time at these quickie regionals. The\nquestion that needs settling is how we do this* by\nextending the length of the regional meeting? perhaps by\nscheduling it at and holding it in a resort\narea? or by scheduling these workshops individually as\nRegion XXX did in the case of music?"
