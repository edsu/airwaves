In the event this is a personal subÂ¬\nscription entered by Mr. Martin himself$ the address should be changed to\nBoston University* where Mr. Martin is employed. If on the other hand the\nsubscription was taken out by tbs University of Alabama the name of Harwood\nshould be substituted for Martin and the address continued as before.\nI do not have the treasurer's records with m in this office so I\nam not certain what the procedure should be. Would either or both of you\nlet me know how we should settle this little problem.\nBP/em\ncct Gray don Ausmus"
