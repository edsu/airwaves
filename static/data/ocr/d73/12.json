Although no rigid priority system\nis necessary, the open-circuit broadcasts, it seems to me, should\ncome first because they would serve to showcase the virtues of\ntelevised education to the community in the most eloquent manner\npossible. Concurrently, in many places, would come the closed-circuit\nsystems and tape machines which would form the ultimate hard core\nof instructional facilities, bringing the advantages of multiple-\nchannel television to every classroom in the nation.\"\nMr. Burns, a former teacher at Harvard and Lehigh, said\nthese three accomplishments would \"solve our basic national education\nproblem within a decade,\" and added that it is against the backdrop\nof this probability that the cost of $2j billion should be evaluated.\nHe said it would represent 13 per cent of one year*s national\neducation budget.\n\"To raise such a sum,\" he said, \"a supreme effort will be\nrequired by every element involved in education â€” Federal, State and\nLocal Governments, Foundations, Business and Industry, and other\nprivate sources. It will not be easy, any more than the shift from\nplanes to missiles was easy in a military sense. But it will be just\nas significant to education as missilry is to security.\""
