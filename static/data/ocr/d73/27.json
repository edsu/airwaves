The result can be, and often has been, worse than\nno television at all. An unimaginative teacher in one classroom is a\nmisfortune for 35 or 40 pupils, but if you put him \"on camera1’ you multiply\nthe misfortune for hundreds or thousands of students.\nWith a program of the scope I have suggested, we could select\nthe best teachers available and support them with the most effective aural\nand visual techniques. By combining the most venturesome concepts of\neducators, broadcasters and graphic arts specialists* we could develop\nmore stimulating presentations in every subject from arithmetic to zoology.\nAnd we could make these presentations available promptly to teachers’ colleges\nand other educational groups, thus starting a chain reaction of teaching\nexcellence. We need training schools for television teachers just as we\nneed dramatic schools for actors and actresses.\nShakespeare’s schoolboy \"creeping like a snail unwillingly to\nschool\" was a victim of poor teaching, but no power in his day could rescue\nhim from this fate. Today, we can do something about the educational\nfate of 45 million American students."
