Above the table, perhaps, is a chart, listing characteristics of\nliving things.. .characteristics of non-living things.\nWe see on screen some drawings of plants and animals which the students have at\nhome.. .arranged under symbols of the seasons., .to show how seasonal changes affect\nthem.\nWe see a vocabulary drill ...on animate, inanimate, life cycle, environment,\nhabitat, characteristics, plants, animals, adapt, seasonal.\nWe might see children pretending to be a stone, a tree, a flower, a log, a bear,\na bee, a chair, etc. and explaining what characteristics they are showing. Or we\nmight see them engaged in a guessing game, in which each has pinned to his back a\nsign showing what he is, and others must ask questions until they guess.\nYes, says the Narrator, you could have done any of these things as an introduction\nto the lesson. Or you could have done a good many others, which you have thought\nof yourself. Just as you would have used such activities to introduce a lesson in the\ntextbook*. .or to prepare your students for a radio broadcast or a film. You would have\nplanned activities to whet their appetites, to give them a foundation, some stepping\nstones of understanding, to insure readiness for what they are about to experience.\nAnd during the lesson? While the television teacher is presenting the lesson\ncontent.. .what could you do.. .as manager of the learning situation?\nThe Narrator says that although this depends in part, of course, on what kind of\nlesson it is and what is taking place on screen, there are some underlying precepts."
