The Executive Director shall\ncarry out these instructions informing the President currently\nabout his activities. The President and the Board shall\nfrom time to time review the work of the Executive Director.\"\n1. The Board of Directors, by unanimous vote, removed from this\nstatement of assignments the following paragraph from the\nExecutive Committee^ original. (This did not indicate\ndisagreement with the instruction, however, but rather the\nfeeling that the Board*s attitude about this could better\nbe expressed informally than through a formal statement:)\n\"The Executive Committee recommends that the Executive\nDirector visit member institutions only in the course of\nbusiness trips taken primarily for other authorized purposed,\nand that he assign to such trips a lower priority of\nimportance than the performance of the headquarters function\noutlined elsewhere in this statement. When he does take such\ntrips he shall make reports to the Board of Directors as to\nhis itineraries and observations.\""
