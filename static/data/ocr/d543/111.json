Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nPurdue University has never planned to conduct any\nWORKSHOPS DURING THE SUMMER OF 1959) HENCE WE AT LEAST\nHAVE NO PROPOSALS TO OFFER FOR USE OF THESE FUNDS* I\nAM SORRY IF I CREATED THIS IMPRESSION* As t INDICATED IN\nMY PRE VIOUS LETTER, 1 AIN *T MAD AT NOBODY.\nIF THERE IS A TIME LIMIT ON THE FORD FUMDS AND IF\nTHEY ARE EARMARKED FOR WORKSHOPS, THEN I THINK THIS SHOULD\nBE A SQUIB IN THE NEWSLETTER* (F NOT, PERHAPS IT SHOULD\nBE HELD FOR AWHILE. AFTER ALL, MOST OF THE WORKSHOPS THAT\nARE GOING TO BE HELD HAVE BEEN PLANNED BOTH AS TO FINANCES\nAND PROGRAM, HENCE A GRANT NOW WOULD NOT PROMOTE THE\nHOLDING OF ANY ADDITIONAL WORKSHOPS THIS SUMMER, WHICH AS\nI UNDERSTAND IT 18 THE PURPOSE OF THE FUND.\nI AM WELL AWARE THAT PURDUE UNIVERSITY HAS HAD MORE\nTHAN ITS SHARE OF GRANTS FROM THE NAEB. FOR THIS REASON\nI AM LOATH TO MAKE ANY FURTHER APPLICATION. I DO NOT\nBELIEVE WE WOULD DO SO EITHER THIS YEAR OR NEXT EVEN IF\nFUNDS ARE AVAILABLE.\nThanks for the informative letters to Lenny Harks\nand from Jim Armsey. The Armsey letter is about what i\nMIGHT EXPECT. i AGREE THIS IS A MOST DIFFICULT AREA BUT\nI DO THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH TALKING TO HIM ABOUT IT. ON\nTHE OTHER MATTER, IF LENNY THINKS HE CAN GET THE DOLLARS\nFOR EBU MEMBERSHIP, I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF IT*\nSorry that we are not going to be able to see one\nANOTHER OVER THE FOURTH, BUT I DO UNDERSTAND* HOPE YOU HAVE\nA PLEASANT TIME.\nS INCERELY,\nJSH S VML\ncc; Bill Harley\nDirector\nfBAA Radio - TV Unit"
