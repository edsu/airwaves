X think we need to he very specific in this. Vague state¬\nments about research needs, in my ©pinion, do not get us far*\nBy the way, Xrv Merrill has expressed the hope that the NAEB\nformally request the Bureau of the Census to include questions about\nradio and television ownership in the forthcoming 1960 Census of\nHousing* X heartily concur* How do the rest of you feel?\nX will take no more of your time at this point. X would appreciate\nhearing from you* X would like to know if you will be at Columbus and\nif you think a meeting of the Research Committee could be held during\nthe Institute period. If not, would you be willing to stay an extra\nday? If you cannot make the Institute, X would appreciate your reactions\nto the above plus any other ideas which you have which you feel should\nbe considered by the committee or which yew feel the committee can do\nsomething about*\nBest,\nSam L. Becker, Chairman\nHAEB Research Committee\ncc: Burton Faulu\nHarry Skoraia\nJack McBride"
