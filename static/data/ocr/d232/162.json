It may not be possible\n?e vice-president in view of my absence from the country—\nalthough that would work out nicely locally. But if not, could I at\nappointed by the president as NAEB representative to the\nUnited Kingdom or some such thing?\nAfter reading Harry's letter to Graham, Larry, and me of October 21,\nI realize how unlikely is financial help from NAEB coffers. Neverthe-\nlessjfor tne record, here is the Paulu's parallel to Larry's story as\ntold m his letter of October 8. Like Larry, we are finding after a\nmonth abroad that ray appointment is much more rewarding from a\npersonal and professional than from a financial point of view. We of\ncourse are prepared to do whatever penny-pinching may be necessary to\nsee us through the year, but ! had strongly hoped some assistance might\nbe forthcoming to meet the fixed dollar commitments in the States which\nI previously outlined for you. Otherwise we most certainly shall ex¬\nhaust all our reserve assets at home, and in case of some large unex¬\npected outlay on the upkeep of our house (our water heater will quite\npossibly need to be replaced, for example) it may even be necessary to\nborrow money from my father—who is living on a teacher's retirement\npension—to pay return passage for Frances and the children.\nMy living allowance here, like Larry's, is predicated on a maximum of\ntwo dependents, so two of the children are excess baggage# Upon\narrival here, we were quartered by the Fulbright people in a by no\nmeans elaborate residential type hotel where the charges for the five\nof us ran to slightly over $100 per week. After two weeks of intensive\nhouse-hunting, we had a choice between a maisonette in Chelsea or this\nhouse in Ealing, either of which would cost us 10 guineas ($30) per\nweek exclusive of utilities. (Housing is extremely scarce; families\nwith children are a doubtful risk; and landlords tend to raise their\nrates the moment an American approaches them.') Rather than let our\nhotel bills run on, we decided to move to Ealing. Here X am about\nan hour from the BBC, but we are able to send Sarah to a County\nCouncil (publicly supported) school, so we at least avoid the ruinous"
