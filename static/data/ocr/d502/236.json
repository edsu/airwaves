It is ex¬\npected that Mr. Novik*s services will be little needed in State-University-based\nlocations, the need being greatest in community-station areas.\nSo far we feel that the service has been definitely justified. Besides the\nstation-by-station guidance above, Mr. Novik has provided excellent inspirational\nand factual help and guidance to the programs of the TV Production Workshop and\nthe NAEB Region I Conference, particularly.\nH.
