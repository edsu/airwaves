As director of your region, why not try to have a meeting\nin a central position in your region, or Work out a joint meeting with\none of your neighboring regions for February or March, This is a lax\nperiod for national meetings generally and you should be able to pull\ngood attendance* Such a meeting would serve as a stimulus for getting\nmore people to come into the organisation and to attend the NAEB\nColumbus meeting as well as laying the groundwork for a big attendance\nat our fall meeting at Piloxi next year. If I can be of service to,\nyou in planning such a regional meeting, please call on me.\nRAKB is our organisation. Let's put a lot into it during the '\nsignificant twelve' months ahead. The success of the organization in,\nyour region depends largely upon you-and HAEB will be only as strong\nas its individual regions make it. *\nYours for a good year*\nSincerely*\nGraydon Ausmus, Â¥iere-President\nnational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nGA/ns"
