I am sorry that Sabine will not be available* My\nREACTION TO THE HUNTER SUGGESTION IS POSITIVE* I SAY THIS\nFOR TWO REASONS* FIRST ARMAN MAKES A GOOD SPEECH ANO HAS\nA GOOD STORY TO TELL ANO SECOND 1 KNOW OF NO OTHER\nIMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE SUBSTITUTE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT\nHIS TOPIC WOULD BE EXACTLY THE ONE WE TALKED ABOUT, BUT I\nAM NOT CERTAIN THAT THIS IS 100 PER CENT VITAL*\nI AM SENDING CARBONS OF THIS LETTER TO BILL HARLEY\nano Harry Skornia. If they have any reactions, I take it\nTHEY WILL LET BOTH OF US KNOW AT ONCE. OTHERWISE IF YOU\nDON’T HEAR ON THIS WITHIN A WEEK, LET’S FIRM UP HUNTER.\nIF THE CENTER WON’T HOUSE OUR THREE RING CIRCUS ON\nFriday, I suggest that all the meetings, for the morning\nAT LEAST AND POSSIBLY FOR THE ENTIRE DAY, BE MOVED TO THE\nUNION TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY TRIPS BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS.\nI HAVE HAD A TURN DOWN FROM GEORGE JOHNSON REGARDING\nTHE EXPERT SESSION. I HAVE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HIM. Do YOU\nTHINK THAT CflV MERRILL COULD HANDLE THIS OR IS HE ALREADY\nINVOLVED? IF YOU THINK HE CAN, WOULD YOU APPROACH HIM ON\nIT AND LET ME KNOW AT ONCE.\nHarry Lamb sent his advance registration to me, hence\nI AM sending it along* In addition will you make tentative\nRESERVATIONS FOR THREE PURDUE PEOPLE FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT,\nTHE 18th LATE ARRIVAL, AND SIX PEOPLE FOR THURSDAY, THE\nI9th* I’ll fill you in on the names within the next week.\nJames S, Miles\nDirector\nWBAA Radio - TV Unit\nJSM:vml\nEnclosure\ncc: Mr. Bill HarIey^"
