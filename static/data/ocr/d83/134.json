In the same way we could\npredict the exact means by which Algebra or Literature\nwould have to be taught, and how long before saturation\nby such means would require a shift to other media\nin order to achieve the same ends. This may sound like\ndeterminism. It is not. Determinism is the result of\nsubliminal control. You may have noticed on ny chart\nthat the upper left HD corner contains not only the con¬\nscious elements in media, but the individual ones.\nThe lower right ID comer contains the subliminal and\ngroup characteristics of media. I did not plan it this\nway. It just turns out that the subliminal characteris¬\ntics are group dynamics. Consciousness will always be\nthe area of the individual and freedom, but of course\nmost of those who talk about such things may be merely\nsubliminally misguided people. Is it not strange that\nas we push into the areas of awareness of our own mechan-\nisims people should shrill \"determinism\" when all they\nmean is that thev are becoming conscious of their own\nt mechanism, that Consciousness can never Itself be mechanical,\nherefore the more consciousness the less mechanism.
