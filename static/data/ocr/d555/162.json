The series deals primarily with Europe as a whole, as far as it exists,\nrather than individual countries.\nThree types of programs are used in the series;\n1. Commentaries of Dr. Schmitt from various capitals of countries participating\nin the European Coal and Steel Community or maintaining accredited missions\nthereto;\n2. Interviews with leading individuals who are either directly concerned with\nthe community or who are notably pro or anti European;\n3. Reports from sites and locations which represent in some unique way the\nachievements or problems of integration; places of relocation of workmen,\nsuch as the steel producing areas of Lorraine, which have absorbed workers\nfrom central France, where inefficient coal mines had to be closed as a\nresult of integration; the Saar, which has been returned to German control, etc.\nThe recordings are made in Europe and forwarded to WNAD where they are screened\nfor quality. Although the mail being what it is has caused some delay in the\nforwarding of some programs, we try to get these to the stations as quickly as\npossible."
