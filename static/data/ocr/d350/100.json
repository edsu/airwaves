In other\nwords, I think that through experiences such as these his abilities as an adminiÂ¬\nstrator and organizer have been strengthened.\nWe are about tb open an EM educational radio station and are conducting experiments\nwith educational television, including the production and recording of TV programs,\nunder Wynn's leadership. Hence, I feel this is no time for a change. On the other\nhand, I doubt if the University would stand in the way of his making a change for\nthe better, especially one of such national importance as that offered by the NAEB.\nSincerely,\nRussell M. Grumman\nDirector"
