Harley\nPresident, NAEB\nSuite 1119\n13^6 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nI havenâ€™t had your answer to my letter of February 7* Kay Lardie\ndid answer, gave me her blessing, and gave me a drubbing for\ncalling the judging of submissions subjective. My plea can only\nbe another generalization: all judgments are subjective, but\nsome are less so than others. (I'm enclosing a copy of her letter.)\nNow Bob Underwood (in a postscript of a letter on another subject)\nwrites that John von Szeleski has been dropped from the 1961 School\nCommittee and asks me whether I'd \"like to ask another party to\ntake his place\" and to send notice of my choice to you and him.\nHe assumes my acceptance of the chairmanship, but I was serious\n(and am serious) in not wanting to accept unless we could shift\nthe nature of the committee function as indicated. It may not get\nany better results, but we could try.\nAs for a substitute for Mr. Szeleski, I'd suggest any producing\nmember of the NAEB using the Radio Network Service. If you wanted\nFlorida represented, then Roy Flynn of WFSU-FM or Clif Mitchell\nof WTHS-JM or Mark Frutchey of WFRK-FM would be eligible.\nSincerely,\nHarry D. Lamb\nDirector\nHDL/jb\nEnd.\nCC: R.E. Underwood"
