  "text": "January 13, 1955\nMr. Allen Miller\n(Former) Director, NAEB Region VI\nDear Allen:\nDuring the past six months I have from time to time picked up the typed\nreport of the REGIOM VI Meeting and reviewed it. It lacked considerable co¬\nhesion so I asked my secretary not only to read it but to attempt to type it\nup in better form and to make some sense out of some of the places where ob¬\nviously words were copied down wrong. My immediate chore and reason for doing\nall of this is, as you know, to write a report on the REGION VI Meeting. This\nI agreed to do in a moment of weakness as Chairman of the NAEB Publications Com¬\nmittee for the year of 195k. I have now come to the conclusion that I shall\nnot attempt to digest the things that were said there more than a year ago\nbut rather will attempt to comment on the written report as I have it, bring¬\ning out the ideas that were expressed and then allowing you to comment on\nthem in rebuttal or agreeing as you see fit. I do think that Dr. Newburn*s\nspeech was of such a nature that it should be reported in toto and it is\nattached herewith.\nI know that you know that I have been associated with the NAEB and its\nworkings for some time. You will remember that I have served (1) on the Board\nfor two two-year terms, (2) as Executive Director for almost a year and a\nhalf, and (3) a year as secretary of the organization. This past year has\nbeen one of relative quietude while I served as Chairman of a rather stormy\nConstitution Committee and the not so stormy Publications Committee. Like\nall good NAEB*ers I read the NEWSLETTER from \"kiver to kiver\" and plan always\nto see the offerings of the NAEB Tape Network as they come in."
