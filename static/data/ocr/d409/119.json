  "text": "Re -the attached letter from Ralph Hall:\ni *\nI hate to be selfish about this, but I do feel that we have to protect\nour own interests. Recently there have been several other suggestions\nabout how people might exchange programs without going through the NAEB\nNet - i.e., this DAVI thing, several of our regional meetings have dis¬\ncussed such an exchange, etc. I’m a little leery of this sort of thing#\nWe hope to strengthen our in-school position in the near future - and will\nif the committee gets going as it should. But this DAVI repository is,\nI would say, in direct competition. If schools can get tapes from DAVI\nfor classroom use at a very nominal sum (what is it, 50£?), they’ll soon\nfeel that there’s no need to pay a larger sum to get NAEB programs and\nbroadcast them to the classroom. If this comes about, we’re not only\nhurting ourselves, but, indirectly, are hurting the chances of the school\nstations to survive.\nThe DAVI library is growing rapidly as it is, but it still may not con¬\ntain the programs that our members really want. Therefore, I don’t feel\nthat we should weaken our position by exchanging tapes with DAVI. I doubt\nthat they have much we could use, and, as I’ve said, if both places have\nmuch the same in programming, who’ll pay our higher fee?\nI think we’d better get busy and strengthen our own in-school position\nand begin to worry about some of the problems they have or we’re going\nto start losing them as Net subscribers. I think this is applicable not\nonly to better programs, but, as I’ve said, I think we should do something\nabout modifying the cost if a school station can only use a small part of\nour offerings.\nheh\n5/3/55"
