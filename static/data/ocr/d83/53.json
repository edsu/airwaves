CANADA\nSeptember 20, I960.\nMiss R. Kusbaum\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nI have been consulted by Professor Marshall\nMcLuhan in connection with a copy of a letter sent on\nbehalf of your client. Miss R. Nusbaum, to the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters.\nI have gone into this matter at some length\nwith Professor McLuhan and from the information that he\nhas given to me I have advised him that the claims of your\nclient do not appear to he to be supportable.\nFirstly, your client knew from the beginning of\nher employment on this project that it was a project of an\nindefinite term and that no one could tell how long it may\nlast. She was advised at the beginning that her employment\nmight be for a period of six months or a year and perhaps even\ntwo years, but it was absolutely impossible to forecast how\nlong her services would be required. She also knew from the\nbeginning that she was to be paid in American funds, since\nthe moneys for the project were from an American grant and\nnot a Canadian one. Naturally, she would have to absortybhe\ndiscount on the American exchange. If she was not satisfied\nwith this arrangement she should have made that clear from the\nbeginning, but this she did not do.\nAlso, it was understood and agreed from the beginning\nthat her salary was to be on the basis of #4500.00 per year. At\nWITHOUT PREJUDICE\nHarvey R. Baiter. Esq.,\nBarrister, Solicitor,\nSuite 703 - 330 Bay Street,\nTORONTO (1), Ontario*\nDear Sir:\nRe:\nAnd"
