Kraetzer, our Radio-Television Co¬\nordinator.\nPerhaps I should have written to you directly\nat that time. Since Mr. Kraetzer is specifi¬\ncally assigned to this activity, I should\nappreciate it if you would transfer the insti¬\ntutional membership from my name to his.\nSincerely yours.\nIk),\nrames W.
