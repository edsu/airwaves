  "text": "£ ability of Model 300 to maintain its\ninitial accuracy of motion is largely due to\nits carefully designed capstan drive. By pre¬\ncision manufacture and rigid unit assembly\nconstruction both flutter and mechanical\nvibration are eliminated. Under continuous\nduty Model 300’s reserve capacity pays off\nin unequalled recording performance and\nnegligible maintenance and servicing re¬\nquirements.\nPRECISION DRIVE MOTORS\nSPECIALLY BUILT FOR MODEL 300\nFINEST TAPE TRANSPORT MECHANISM Ever Built for Audio Recording!\nSPECIFICATIONS\nr\nAll performance characteristics of the\nModel 300 Magnetic Tape Recorder equal\nor exceed the standards of the NAB (Na¬\ntional Association of Broadcasters). All\nAmpex audio recorders produce a tape fre¬\nquency characteristic which has been ac¬\ncepted as standard by NAB.\nTAPE SPEED\n1 5 inches per second and 7.5 inches per\nsecond, with speed change effected by\na single control. The same control also\nprovides the necessary equalization\nchange to compensate for the change\nin speed.\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15 inches ±2 db. 30-15,000 cycles.\n7 V2 inches ±4 db. 40-15,000 cycles.\n±2 db. 40-10,000 cycles.\nSIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO\nx Over 70 db. unweighted noise to maxi¬\nmum recording level. Over 60 db, as\ndefined by NAB standards. By NAB\ndefinition, the signal-to-noise ratio is\nthe ratio of peak recording level to the\ntotal unweighted playback noise when\nerasing a signal of peak recording\nlevel and in the absence of a new\nsignal. Thus bias and erase noise are\nincluded, as well as playback ampli¬\nfier noise. All frequencies between 50\nand 15,000 cycles are measured. The\npeak recording level is defined as that\nlevel at which the overall (input to out¬\nput) total rms harmonic distortion does\nnot exceed 3 % when measured on a\n400 cycle tone.\nSTARTING TIME\nInstantaneous. (When starting in the\nNormal Play mode of operation, the\ntape is up to full speed in less than\n1/10 second.)\nSTOPPING TIME\nWhen playing at 1 5 inches per second,\ntape moves less than 2 inches after de¬\npressing Stop button.\nFLUTTER AND WOW\nAt 15 inches per second, well under\n0.1 % rms, measuring all flutter com¬\nponents from 0 to 300 cycles, using a\ntone of 3,000 cycles. At 7.5 inches,\nunder 0.2 %.\nPLAYBACK TIMING ACCURACY\n0.2% or ±3.6 seconds for a 30\nminute recording.\nPLAYING TIME\n33 minutes at 1 5 inch speed on stand¬\nard NAB reel, 66 minutes at 7.5 inch\nspeed. The Model 300 will also accom¬\nmodate the standard RMA reel in vari¬\nous thicknesses.\nREWIND TIME\nOne minute for the full NAB reel (2400\nfeet).\nCONTROLS\nStart, Stop and Record are push-button,\nrelay operated and may be remote con¬\ntrolled. Normal Play, Fast Forward, and\nRewind on a selector switch, with rapid\nshuttling back and forth made possible\nby instantly changing from one mode\nof operation to the other without stop¬\nping in between.\nCOMPLETE PLUG-IN HEAD HOUSING\nDouble mumetal shield cans on play¬\nback head, equivalent shielding on\nrecord head, matching self-aligned\ncovers on hinged gate. Drop-in thread¬\ning.\nSIMULTANEOUS MONITORING\nIndependent record and playback sys¬\ntems allow the tape to be monitored\nwhile recording.\nRECORD AMPLIFIER\n10,000 ohms bridging input, normally\nset up for +4 VU in balanced or un¬\nbalanced.\nPLAYBACK AMPLIFIER\nAdjusted for +4 VU output, 600 ohms\nor 150 ohms balanced or unbalanced.\nWill deliver -j-20 dbm without exceed¬\ning 1 % total harmonic distortion at\nany frequency from 30-15,000 cycles.\nDIMENSIONS\nMechanical unit on 24^/2\" panel and\nElectronic unit on 12V4\" panel. For\nstandard rack, console or two case port¬\nable mounting.\nSHIPPING WEIGHTS AND MOUNTING\nConsole 270 pounds, 2 Case Portable\n175 pounds. Rack 140 pounds.\nPOWER INPUT REQUIRED\n3 amperes, 115 volts, 60 cycles. (Also\navailable for 50 cycles.)\nMETER CONTROL PANEL\nAvailable at extra cost with features\noutlined as follows: Mounted on 5’A\"\npanel for rack, console, or portable case\nmounting. Bridge Input step control\nwill adjust record level for any input\ngreater than —20 VU, 10,000 ohm\nbridging, any balanced or unbalanced\nline. Output Step control will adjust\nlevel up to +8 VU with normal of tape\nlevel — 600 ohm or 1 50 ohm balanced\nor unbalanced line. VU meter will meter\nplayback output while recording or\nplaying back. Calibrated for +4 VU\noutput. Output key (line or cue). Phone\nJack with input-output key (A-B Key).\nCATALOG NUMBER\n(115-120 Volt AC)\n60 50\nMODEL NUMBER cycle cycle\n300-C.Console 560-C 3389\n300-R.Rack Mounted 560-R 3390\n300-S ..
