A graduated\nscale has been set up whereby new stations do not pay the full fee until\nthe third year. Annual Network assessments are based on the same power\nclassifications as membership*\n2rA i&ar\n$300.00\n500.00\n300.00\nr§l ,2BfiE\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nIn addition, member stations must pay postage both ways on tapes shipped\nto and from the Network. For a station in your area this would amount\nto approximately $27.50 a year if you availed yourself of all the pro¬\ngrams made available by the Network. (There is a strong possibility that\nthere will soon be Congressional action to lower rates far educational\nrecordings, which would make postage payments considerably lower.) Even\nwith the postage charges you see that the cost per hour of programming\n(for 400 hours, or more) is very low.\nIn addition to the regular Network service described above (a sample Net¬\nwork offering is included in the material being sent separately), we make\navailable in-school programs to those stations who do in-school broad¬\ncasting. For this service a station pays an additional fee of one-fourth\nof the regular assessment, or $2.00 per reel, whichever is less. However,\nsince many in-school stations are not on the air during the summer months,\nsuch stations are allowed to substitute the in-school programs for regular\nprograms they would receive during the summer, and thus pay no additional\nfee for the in-school service.\nIf, after you’ve had an opportunity to look over the materials I’m send¬\ning, you have any questions about the NAEB, please let me know, and we’re\nlooking forward to the opportunity of serving you.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEIIsjy\nEnclosures"
