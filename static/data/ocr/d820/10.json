The reactions of Keith along with the reactions of\nmy own engineering staff lead me to the following propos¬\nals:\nI would like the Engineering Committee of the NAEB\nencouraged to conduct a preliminary discussion to deter¬\nmine if this committee wishes to recommend to the Board\nthat funds be requested from some appropriate source to\nconduct an extensive engineering survey along the fol¬\nlowing lines:\n1. A nation-wide engineering survey to determine\nthe practicability of a national multiplexed\nnetwork with or without the installation of\nadditional transmitters.\n2. A pilot experiment in t^ie state of Michigan\nor in any other state’ that they might con¬\nsider to be more appropriate to be operated\nduring the time the national survey is being\nmade.\nIn the event that such a request should come from\nthe Engineering Committee, in the event that the Board\nof Directors approves the request for funds, in the event\nthat these funds are forthcoming, and in the event that\nmultiplexing ultimately develops either on a state, nat¬\nional, or regional basis - I would anticipate the follow¬\ning benefits to NAEB member as compared with the present\nNAEB tape network:\n1.
