Holt and his staff\nshould be widely disseminated. I hope that you concur\nin this view and that after appropriate review and\nevaluation within your organizations,the material or\nan abstract of it can be made available for publication.\nEBR would, I think, be a highly appropriate vehicle.\nWhile the research relates, as I understand it, primarily\nto public radio, I believe the Commission on Instructional\nTechnology would be interested in receiving the radio\nmaterial. The Title III study is nearing completion but\ninput to the Instructional Technology Commission staff\nmight be of value even at this time.\nOur radio division direction Bob Mott, tells me that\neducational stations across the country have been most\nreceptive and cooperative in the preparation of the\nPublic Radio Study. Station personnel indicates to\nhim a strong interest in appropriate distribution of the\nresearch as soon as practicable.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley"
