Guess I\nneglected to say anything to you. It's now a basic document for use by\nmy Seminar students. Excellent job.\nI too am too busy to do a decent job of writing. Been particularly\nrushed with trips etc. lately. Expect to be in N. Y. Wednesday night\nand Thursday a.m., in fact. Have at least three conferences, but will\ncall you if I have time. Staying at the Shelburne Hotel, near Air\nTerminal, 303 Lexington Avenue at 37th Street.\nAttached are two items. Taishoff's insistence on taking ETV frequencies\naway, moved me to write the attached letter to the Editor. Suppose he'll\nuse it? Would like to get this point of view to readers of his magazine.\nThe other (the dittoed one) is one I haven't placed yet, either. If you\nhave any ideas, let me know.\nRegards,\nHJStjy\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
