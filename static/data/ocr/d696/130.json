Sulaer, Director\nRadio-TV CommicaKeioia©\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Stood:\nBill would like to have a proposal from you, as chaiimn of the MSB Public\nBelationc Ccfiiaitte©, to present to the MSB Board of Directors at the time\nof its faceting here at the convention.\nBe would like a specific proposal for the production of an MSB slid© to\nbe used by member stations, together with copy to be read by an announcer\nwhich could be used for either TV (in conjunction with the slide) or radio.\nSince this is something you’ve been in favor of doing Tor seme time. I’m\nsure you’ll be happy to come up with such a proposal. The proposal should\ninclude some rough drawings of what two or three sample slides might look\nlike, plus costs of making the Hides, if you can get that, plus some sam¬\nple scripts for use as indicated above.\nSince the Board will actually meet before your committee does, I presume that\nyou’ll have to do this on your am as chainaan unless you think you have time\nto poll the committee and then get the proposal to me a few days prior to the\nconvention so X can include it in the Board agenda. However, I don’t think\nthere would be anything wrong with your doing it alone (since your committee\nhas talked about this before) and then telling your ccaaaittee about it at the\ntime they meet here - in fact, by then I may be able to tell you what the Board\naction has been.\nELease let me know what you plan to do (just to keep me informed) and then I’d\nappreciate the proposal Just as soon as you can get it to me. Shanks, and I\nhate to rush you at the last sHmifce, but it couldn’t be avoided.\nCordially,\nBarold £• Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nBEHj/mla"
