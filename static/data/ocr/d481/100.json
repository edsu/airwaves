Harley\nPresident\nN.A.E.B.\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nI note in your confidential memorandum as of February 14, 1961, that you ^\nagreed to take an assignment at the DAVI Convention in Miami as of April 22.\nDo I understand by this that you are cancelling your appearance at the\nRegion II Conference in Birmingham on April 22, 1961?\nYour memorandum of February 9, 1961, states that: \"Because the TV members\nof the Board will be on hand anyway (at Center expense), this occasion proÂ¬\nvides an opportunity for assembling the entire Board and taking up some matters\nthat need reporting or policy decision.\" Farther on you state, \"Board members\n^ not attending as Center Affiliates should make their own reservations using the\nenclosed card.\" No card was enclosed in my communication, and so I do not\nunderstand provisions thereon. The two statements above quoted from your\nmemorandum do not agree for certainly as a TV Board member myself I am not\nincluded in the invitation that the Center is giving. Before making any decisions\nor statements in this connection, I will await a reply from you. The earliest\npossible response to the above questions will be appreciated.\nSincerely yours,"
