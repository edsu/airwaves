SIEGEL, PRESIDENT\nHerewith are copies of suggested releases for each of the\n13 programs which constitute \"The Jeffersonian Heritage\" series* These\nreleases may be re-written completely, if you so desire.\nThe best way to make us of these is to mimeograph or\nduplicate each release - after filling in your station call letters, and the\ntime, day and date that the program is to go on the air. These should\nbe mailed to all the radio and newspaper editors in your area at least\n10 days to two weeks before air time.\nYou might use extra copies and send them directly to some\nof the important people in your institution, and your community.\nPlease note that the use of term \"Release Number 1\" should\nnot appear on your own copy.\nWe would be delighted to hear from you as to how you are\nmaking use of this audience building aid.\nsns/t\nends."
