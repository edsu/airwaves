LOUIS\nDIVISION OF AUDIO'VISUAL EDUCATION\n1517 SOUTH THERESA AVENUE (4)\nOctober f>, 1955\nDear John:\nMr. John Holt, Manager\nNAEB Tape Network\nllli Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nEnclosed is a copy of the letter and questionnaire that the\nIh-School Committee asked me to compose.\nI do not have the list of stations to whom this should be\nsent so I think it is wise for me to send this on to you and\nask that the letter and questionnaire be sent out and returnÂ¬\ned to you. If I can get the answers soon enough to compile a\nreport and if you want me to, 1*11 be glad to do that part of\nit.\nPlease feel free to make any changes you think should be made.\nI decided it was best to include all five years instead of just\nlast year since we had the fewest offerings last year. However,\n1*11 leave that up to you.\nHastily,\nSt ation KSLH\nMF:s\ncc-Mr. aarry J. Skornia\nMr. Harold Hill"
