You may have\nseen the recent study which indicates that the educated Negro is often just\nas angry and just as ready to go along with violence as is the less well\neducated precisely because he has made the educational hurdle and is still\nbarred from the economic promised land.\nSo, it is not enough for television to educate the disadvantaged.\nIf domestic peace and justice are to be achieved, will television not also\nhave to educate the rest of us to accept the practice of what we preach?\nIf we really believe that education is the barrier, then once the dis¬\nadvantaged are educated, we must be ready to break the barriers. We\nmust educate the ghettos, yes, but we must also educate the suburbs.\nThe people on the outside of the ghettos who still practice a TV kind\nof paternalism. How long do you think society can keep saying: \"Look---\nbut don’t touch.’?\nWe are talking about television; and we are all of us tuned in.\nThe Bible says that the child is father to the man. Freud said that what\na man will be is determined by the time he is three years old. And the\nlatest statistics say that two-year olds spend about 20 hour per week\nwatching television.\nWe—all of us--need the education that television and the other elec¬\ntronic media can provide. Just as we want the people inside the ghetto to\nlearn, those of us outside of it have also got to be ready to learn. For\nthe many of us who have been emotionally raised in a world of platitudinous\nbeliefs and verbal rationalizations it isn't going to be easy. But in\nrealistic terms, for those who can't see it from any other point of view,\nI suspect that it beats having to choose between hiding out forever in the\ncrab grass or risking a hole in the head to visit the art museum in the\ncenter of the city."
