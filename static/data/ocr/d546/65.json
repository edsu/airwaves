If we do\nnot get that many, those we do have may be more\nof a nuisance than anything elseâ€”because they\nmay not make enough money to make their time\nconsumption worthwhile.\nHad I been working at the usual schedule on the\nJournal, instead of various other projects, it's\nconceivable that this one ad could hold up the\nwhole Journal.\nAnd I'm not really griping, but you asked me to\nkeep you informed as to how -the ad went. .. and as\nBusiness Manager, I think you should know all\nthe gruesome details. So here you are, sir...\nwith my love.\nbmck"
