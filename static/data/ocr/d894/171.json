  "text": "Freedom for the New Communications,\nA reader, commenting on pur re¬\ncent editorial, “Radio Editorials Up\nFor Hearing Again,’’ raises a ques¬\ntion: “If and when radio facsimile\nnewspapers become common, what\nshould be the rule covering ex¬\npressions of editorial opinion?”\nThe question is an important\none. We said in our editorial that\nthe changing technology of com¬\nmunication makes any conclusions\nabout freedom to editorialize by\nradio tentative. Although we men¬\ntioned only television, we might\nproperly have included both fre¬\nquency modulated radio (FM) and\nfacsimile printing by radio.\n(A report on the background of\nfederal licensing of radio stations\nand control of program content, to¬\ngether with some of the implica¬\ntions for facsimile newspapers is\npresented on this page today.)\nIt is conceivable that the limited\nfreedom of radio stations might be\nchanged to complete freedom—as\ncomplete as the freedom of news¬\npapers— if FM radio becomes gen¬\neral. FM transmission permits a\ngreat number of radio stations to\nbroadcast simultaneously without\ninterference. Government licensing\nmight become so free (like the sec¬\nond class mailing permit of a news¬\npaper) that it would be feasible to\n. remove1' all restrictions oh radio\nbroadcasts of opinion.\nThe same general conclusion may\nhold, also, for television. The limit¬\ned range of television may 'mean\nthat many more stations could, be\nestablished all over the country—\nenough so that licensing would be¬\ncome free enough to permit edito¬\nrializing by station owners. On the\nother hand, television development\nmay take other directions; no one\ncan be sure.\nThe key to freedom for broad-\ncasters to editorialise is freedom of\nv:* entry into the business. That is\nthe reason why radio station edito¬\nrializing is restricted now—because\nof the necessity for government li¬\ncensing of the limited number of\nradio frequency channels available.\nFacsimile printing by radio raises\nstill more troublesome problems. Is\nit radio or is it printing? Since\nfacsimile will be transmitted by FM\nradio, the same conclusions prob¬\nably would hold for it as $or FM\nsoubd broadcast.\nWe are entering into completely\nunexplored fields of communication\nat breakneck speed these days. It\nwill take level-headed statesman¬\nship to develop procedures consist¬\nent with our basic tenets of free¬\ndom of speech and freedom of the\npress."
