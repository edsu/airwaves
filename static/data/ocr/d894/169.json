B. Moorman pointed out that\nby square shooting he means shoot¬\ning only cock pheasants and leav¬\ning hens. By shooting cocks only,\nbreeding stock can be maintained\nand there’ll be plenty of birds to hunt\nnext year. Killing a hen pheasant\ncuts the following year’s crop any¬\nwhere from three to six birds.\nHe also appealed to hunters to\nobserve the short hunting day. Then\nthe birds have a chance to feed in\nthe forenoon, and with the close of\nthe hunting day at 4:30 p.m. they\nhave a chance to get back to roost¬\ning areas before dark. This gives the\npheasants a chance to escape hawks,\\\nowls and predatory animals,\ncording to Moorman.\nTODAY S WEATHER\nToday should be another fine\nday according to the weather man.\nToday’s high temperature should\nexceed yesterday’s. With a clear\nsunny day the thermometer will\nrise to the sixties.\nWOI-TV Equipment\nCoaxial Cable Now\nGrads Don’t Write—\nLivestock Show\nBegins Monday\nAt Dairy Farm\nThe 1949 Little International gets\nunderway at the college dairy\nfarm Monday afternoon at 2.\nCo-eds representing dormitories\nand sororities will vie for the title\nof Milking Queen in a milking\ntournament staged during the after¬\nnoon.
