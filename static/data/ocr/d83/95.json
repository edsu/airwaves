Our fiscal report won’t\nbe sent in until July at the earliest, so we can take care of state¬\nments after June 30.\nThank you for sending on the checks to the various caapanies.\nPlease tell Dr. McLuhan we were all shocked by the sudden death of\nDr. Skornia‘ s father and are trying to lighten the load by being as\nhelpful as possible at a time like this.\nThanks again Ruth for the nice note.\nSincerely,\nRSsjl"
