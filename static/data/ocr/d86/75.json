Friday afternoon I went down to the Governor’s office\nto check on the Oren Harris comraunication picture. Much scurrying about and\nasking people if they had seen anythihg come in. Ed Fossett said he had\nalerted everyone. No results, though.\nAppears to be some chance that if anything came in it was routed over to\nWendell Butler by Wendell Ford. Fossett had to remind him that he had been\nasked to keep an eye out for such a communique.\nSuggest that Harold Hill direct an inquiry to the Hill about the subject.\nShould Harris s-c staff claim they sent request, then chances are good that\nthe thing did come in and was referred to Education. If it was handled in\nthis fashion, Lord only knows what came or will come out of it.\nAsked Billingsley (privately) what his views on mentioning ChaAhel 10\nin '-'ommittee^ meeting were. He was puzzled about Hudson’s not mentioning it.\nIf WAVE doesn’t imow about it, they evidently have not been too thorough in\ntheir engineering. If they do know about it, why haven’t they mentioned it?\nProbably very simple answer to whole thing. My problem is that 1 do not trust\nbusinessmen any more-only government employees.\nA11 for now.\nEd"
