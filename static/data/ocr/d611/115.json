Other stations are simply pleased to learn what\nis going on in other shops. But just knowing what is going on\ncan promote a number of positive avenues. If nothing else, it\ncan fire our imaginations and encourage us to stretch, to seek,\nto explore and to finally turn the mirror back on ourselves and\nask, \"Is it enough?\"\nThe measure of effectiveness of these programs is different\nfor every station. There are no general rules. We are writing\nrules today and changing them tomorrow. I urge you to write some\nof these other stations and put your questions to them. I think\nyouâ€™ll find some of their answers remarkably useful.\nSincerely yours.\nKenneth R. Clark,\nProject Director\nKRC/odl\nP.S. I cannot resist pointing out the nomination of Julian Bond\nfor Vice-President by the Democratic Party last night!"
