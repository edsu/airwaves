  "text": "OW NOT TO SPLICE\nThe splices shown in the above photograph were not made up for this occasion. They\nare actual splices taken from tapes received here, tapes upon which we were supposed\nto record programs for use over the air. We know we did not make these splices;\nthus, by examining this photo and reading the comments below we feel you will agree\nthat some definite steps had to be taken to improve the Network tape situation.\nIf you inadvertently break a Network tape - or any tape for that matter - it will\nbe to your advantage and to the advantage of all Network members if you splice it\ntogether according to some recommended manner. Please bear in mind that we are not\nattempting to dictate the method by which you should splice tapes; our sole interest\nis in obtaining well spliced tapes if, indeed, the tapes we use must be spliced ones.\nIt is safe to say that if the tapes we use were either free from splices or spliced\nproperly according to recommended methods we would be able to operate at higher\nefficiency and output, and all stations would be able to air our tapes without the\nfear of having them skip or break during a program.\nAlthough there are many ways by which splicing should not be done, here are a few\nof the common splices found in returned tapes here:\n1. The Overlapping Splice. The picture shows the oxide side of the tape, and the\nsplicing tape is not shown. Here the loose ends were not joined, but one end\nwas placed on top of the other. Notice, also, that the bottom piece shoots off\nat an angle, indicating that the splicer did not bother to use a splicing block."
