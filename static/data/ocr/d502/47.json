Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\n1954 - ' :r:-. o\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nMAR 23 1954\n1,2,3,41^\ni\nOne or two items that have crossed my desk recently lead me to\nask you whether you are under the impression that we have here\nall we need in order to take some action with respect to your\nrequest for funds for a \"consultant on labor matters\" (Morris\nNovik).\nPossibly there was some lack of communication on this one,\nbut you will recall that in any formal request to the Fund you\nhave included the Labor Consulting Services as one among several\nother such items with no separate budget for this service in its\nown right. My recollection of our talks in Chicago was that you\nwere going to discuss with Harry Newburn and possibly others, the\nidea of the NAEB's offering such a service, but doing so in the\ninterests of all organizations and agencies concerned—so that\nyour man, in effect, would be alert to the needs also of the\nCenter, the JCET, the NCCET, etc., and might, on occasion, take\ncare of quite specific matters for them. Also, as I recall it\nwe were to get a further statement from you on the particulars\nas to the budget for this service—fees, travel, etc.\nLet me hasten to add that I may be in error as to how things\nwere actually left. In any event, we really should have a state¬\nment covering the above points just as soon as possible.\nM\\y very best.\niffiths\nv"
