  "text": "Skomia - 2\nan archetypal game or play situation which ensures for the\nwhole of mankind the utmost possibilities of creativity.\nThe perpetual interplay between our private and our techno¬\nlogical sensoria constitutes for the whole human family\na continuous life of learning and discovery. Such was not\nthe case when one or another of our senses was externalized\nas in writing, or in film, or telephone. Such lopsided\nparameters of limping intensity have for many centuries\nalienated men from the equilibrium they had earlier\nachieved by means of the technology of speech (organized\nstutter). For in speech all of our senses are simultaneously\nengaged as they are not in any other medium.\nI hope you will feel that I am not letting the NAEB\ndown nor above all your confidence in me in tackling this\nstaggering concept.\nArt Knowles is working on the problem of graphics\nand film clips for the Gutenberg video which we hope to do\nin Detroit at the end of this month.\nWould that we could get vast quantities of TV into\nAfrica. TV is a cool medium. Radio is a hot medium. Dis¬\ncussing this matter with Philip Deane (who will be here\nApril 28th) he agreed and said that the political effects\nof TV in North America are tending toward rigor mortis.\nI am most curios to hear some details about Castro*s\nusing of TV in Cuba. While he is on TV daily, the overall\nsituation is probably kept very hot by radio. Philip Deane\nsaid that he would like to say these things about the media\nin the press, but there is not an editor in the world who\nwould let the stuff through. He and I hope to collaborate\non some magazine articles on these matters.\nMost cordially."
