I can do that in three\nsentences.\nFirst, define your objectives specifically in terms of your own museum.\nSecond, make a study of your community to find out what the prevailing attitudes\nare. Find out the radio and TV stations in your community and their interests.\nFinally, work out plans of activities and translate your program into action.\nThere you have it. It*s really very simple.\nHow, lest you think I haven9t gone into your field a little more in detail,\npermit me to suggest that Mr. Edward L. Bernays* survey of some years ago is familiar\nto a great many educational radio people. There seem to \"be four problems facing\nmuseums:\n1- The problem of personnel to head museums.\n2- Support for museums -- inadequate contributions and the problem of getting\npeople to attend and use museum facilities.\n3~ The problem of satisfying the needs of various groups which use museums,\nchildren, adults, and etcetra.\n*4- Public relations problem of using all avenues of approach to the public to\nmeet your problems of financial support and attendance.\nIn the present state of civil defense planning, the problem of morale is still\nan important one. Museums more than any other single force can build morale by inÂ¬\ncreasing people* s belief in the future and themselves by showing them the past and the\npresent.\nMuseums also provide an escape for people made tense by continued, highly charged,\nnews reports."
