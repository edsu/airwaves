An\nalternate suggestion would be to supply a script with the\nslides or filmstrips for local presentation,\n- Film documentary showing a variety of class activities that\ndeveloped from one educational broadcast. This could start\nby showing or playing a part or all of the film or tape of\nthe program stimulating this utilisation,\n- Collections of class work resulting from educational broad¬\ncasts , such as art work, literature, science, music and\nsimilar projects,\nI am not trying to spell out a specific project we would like you\nto do. You are the only one who knows what is possible within your\ndepartment.\nAfter you have had an opportunity to look over these comments,\nperhaps you will have some specific suggestions or questions.
