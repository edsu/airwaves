However, we know at least that\nthe University of Michigan Press is affected by this provision and\nthere nay be other college and university presses which would bo\nhit through this restriction,\nMichigan Stata would take the poeition that the bill should be\nmdifled to exclude the college or university presses, or those\npublishing activities conducted by a recognised and accredited\neducational institution. This at least would stake it possible\nfor any of the university presses to have some leeway in the\nfuture without jeopardising the broadcasting stations and sorvieas\nwhich they night have in operation or plan to put into operation\neventually,\nfrm what I can gather in the trade press it doesn't look as UP\nthe bill will have much chance of success, inasmuch as it is being\nopposed by the full weight of the commercial broadcasting industry.\nHowever, should there be any possibility that this bill or a modi¬\nfication of it might be enacted, then I think that the college and\nUniversity presses and broadcast stations should be exempt from its\nprevisions,\nSinoerely,\nAmend I*, mntar\nDirector\nALH/im\nMay 2, 19S8\nMr* Marcus Cohn\nCafrlts Building\nWashington 6, B* 0.\nc.c.
