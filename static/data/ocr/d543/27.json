Leonard and I are\nworking on something else which I expect he will bring in at\nthe Monday Board meeting. We believe that this problem has\ngot to be solved; and I think you are quite right in continu¬\ning to oppose anything which does not take care of the community\neducational television station, because it seems to me that this\nis a type of station which is becoming more and more important.\nOne comment about Dallas, however. I*m ashamed of you. You\nshould know that Dallas is above Federal aid of any kind.\nBest personal regards.\nRFS:rs\ncc: NAEB Board Members\nDr. Harry J. Skornia\nMr. Leonard H. Marks"
