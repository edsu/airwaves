Tyler\n1564 Fulham Street\nSt. Paul 8, Minnesota\nDear Tracy:\nAs you recall from the Publications Committee meeting in\nOctober, 1959, it was decided that the position of editor\nof the NAEB Journal should be a rotating one with a new\neditor appointed each year. Accordingly, Dr. Skornia\nre-elected you for this position for 1960.\nI have not chosen a successor to you as yet, but I did\nnot want the end of your term to go by unmarked or unrecogÂ¬\nnized. You have done an outstanding job for many years as\neditor of the Journal and your editorial comments have\nmaintained a constant high level of scholarly insight and\nbalanced judgement.\nI am aware that this has been largely a labor of love\nwith scant recognition and rewards counted only in the\nsatisfaction that comes from doing a professional job\nwith competence and in so doing, making an important\ncontribution to a cause in which you believe.\nYou should also count among these intangible satisfactions\nthe gratitude of your colleagues in NAEB and all those\ninterested in educational broadcasting. In their behalf,\nX extend our thanks for your many years of selfless service\nand editorial leadership.\nI trust that you will continue to serve as a member of\nthe Publications Committee so that the Association may\nhave the continuing benefit of your Invaluable advice\nand counsel."
