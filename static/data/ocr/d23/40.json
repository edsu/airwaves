If faulty operation is indicated, non-remote\ncontrol and operation and re-calibration of the remote control system\nemployed should be promptly carried out. Experience with remote control\nsystems has indicated that occassionaily improper bridging of the telephone\nline circuits employed or the existence of ground currents or line surge\ncomponents will result in spurious readings not attributable to the antenna\nsystem performance. When such conditions arise engineering judgement should\nbe brought to bear and the system of the control apparatus should be serviced\npromptly. Whenever possible buried telephone pairs should be used to avoid\nseasonal weather problems such as lightning and snow damage.\nSection 8(8)\n’’Whether and how often remote meters should be\ncalibrated, and whether such calibration curves\nshould be posted at the control point7n\nWeekly calibration of remote antenna meters where employed should\nbe sufficient. It is recommended that existing systems should be maintained\nin this respect to aid in routine inspection and maintenance procedures\ninvolving the array. Calibration curves at the remote control point should\nnot be required.\nWeekly calibration of the remote control and operation metering\ncircuitry should be carried out during routine maintenance periods. Hourly\ncalibration check provisions inherent in control equipment operation should\nbe observed.\nIn the event that the proposed or similar amendments are adopted\n- 4 ."
