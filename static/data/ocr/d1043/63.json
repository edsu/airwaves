Schooley\nRe: Columbus, and other items.\n1, Tentatively onlyj I’d suggest we plan to meet starting Monday\nevening, April 11, in the Deshler-Hilton, and plan meetings for\nTuesday only. I’m opposed to meetings beyond Tuesday, although\nwould meet for any emergency matters.\n2c After conferring with the Executive Committee, the 1955 Convention\nCommittee, and with Keith Tyler, I have invited Senator John W.\nBricker to be our luncheon speaker at Columbus on April 14. This\nshould be confidential\n3. I am asking Harold Engel, WHA, to be in charge of the luncheon\nat Columbus.\n4„ On or about April 1, I hope to set up agenda for Columbus\nmeeting, get copies to you, along with any major proposals,\nso that you can consider before coming to the spot. At the same\ntime, I shall firm up meeting times. Personally, I ivould be quite\nwilling to meet with those present on Monday evening, forgiving\nany late arrival, if saving one more day makes it easier on any\none or more members, and providing it is agreeable.\n5a FYI. confidential, have this day invited President Pusey of Harvard\nto deriver'lceynoTer at 1955 NAEB Convention in Chicago. Have\nalso done some spade work, getting others to urge acceptance.\n6o Incidentally, these items by mail and actions by Executive\nCommittee have been effort on my part to expedite business, and to\nhold down length of Board meetings in Columbus. Most of youfll\nrecall that Executive Committee is empowered to act providing\nactions are reported to Board and made a matter of Board record.\nThis was action taken at Biloxi. I assure you, individually and\ncollectively, that if Executive Committee acts on some item or\nitems that you wish reconsidered, this is within both protocol\nand rights of Board member and your president was so ruled.\nBut if there is no descent, then we’ve saved time."
