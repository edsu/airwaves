An acceptable minimum\noperation schedule for a public station might be eight\nhours per day, five days per week, 52 weeks per year.\n6. Philosophy of Programming. While the previous crit¬\neria are valid the most significant factor is: How does\nthe station licensee and its management identify its\nrole in serving the public? If, in fact, the station\nacknowledges that it is serving a limited public or a\nselected audience without intending to serve a variety\nof publics covering a spectrum of the community, it would\nnot qualify as for CPB support.\nPerhaps the simplest approach is to develop categories\nand ask stations to identify themselves as public, in¬\nstructional, religious, campus-oriented or whatever.\nObviously, some refinement of these comments would be\nneeded before establishing a scale for determining\npublic and non-public stations. A station should not\nbe ruled out on the basis of a single factor. Rather,\na combination of factors should be utilized to make the\njudgment.\nThe essential factor is that not all stations operating\ntoday should be identified as public stations. The\nCorporation would be wise to separate the wheat from the\nchaff in a rapid threahing exercise.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAMilkl\ncc: Robert Swezey\nWilliam Harley"
