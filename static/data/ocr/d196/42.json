Xetf there gag organization and the\norganizers were skilled. ‘They knew where they were going and what\nthey were going to do when they got there. The mob was not orderly,\nbut it was ordered*\nIt was ordered by young men carrying the banners of the lily of\nTrieste or the flame of the neo-Faacist party or, perhaps, the tricolor\nof Italy. These young men knew what they were doing when they led the\nway to the Piazza Venezia and they knew what they were trying to do\ndel\nlater in the day, when they stormed up Vla/Babulno toward the Piazza\ndi Spagna.\nVia del Babuino is the narrow thoroughfare that connects two of\nRome's beat known squares — the Piazza del Popolo and the Piazza di\nBpagna* The students had reformed in the Piazza del Popolo and started\ntoward the Piazza di Spagna to demonstrate in front of the British\nconsulate* Once again they Jammed a narrow street with a raging sea\nof young humanity* It would have been hopeless to try to move down\nit against the tide*\nBut this time the Interior ministry's riot squads were on hand*\nBy Jeepload and truektoad these national police pulled into the square,\nblocking all incoming traffic and taking positions where they could\nmove quickly to cover any of the arteries leading into It*"
