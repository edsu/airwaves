This includes:\n- The audited financial report of Ford Foundation grant uses,\nsigned by Mr. Jack L. McGregor, Auditor.

This\ncovers the period of earlier grants from the Fund for Adult\nEducation and the Ford Foundation as well as a complete\nrepeat covering the period of our latest grant. If additional\ncopies of this report are needed, we shall be glad to provide\nthem.\nAlthough our program report expresses more formally the very profound\nappreciation and gratitude of the NAEB for the support we have had from\nfunds provided by the Ford Foundation since 1951, the Board has asked\nme to express, once again, our deepest thanks for the very great sup¬\nport which these grants have provided to the many recipients who have\nshared in their benefits.\nWe have attempted to administer these funds responsibly on behalf of\nAmerican education, as well as on behalf of the entire educational move¬\nment. We hope you share with us the pride we have in the accomplish¬\nments of the last few important years.\nSincerely yours.\nhjsrrs\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
