Fairchild, Chairman\nDirector of Adult Education\nDivision of Social Philosophy\nThe Cooper Union\n8th Street at Uth Avenue and Aston Place\nNew York, New York\nDear Johnson:\nfirst of all let ms say what a real pleasure it was to have the oppor¬\ntunity of getting to know you a little bit at Biloxio Such opportunities are,, to\nmy mind, the greatest achievement of such meetings *\nEnclosed is a copy of the letter which I am sanding to Mr* Burdello\nThe only thing I can think of that possibly should have been added is the hope of\nsome day of being able to offer printed copies of the talk, but I don't know\nwhether or not to go into that so I Just left it out*\nI have also suddenly been inspired with the idea that it is highly\ndesirable for us to distribute the program booklets to our member stations. For\nthe current forums I brought back enough of the booklets from Biloxi to make 'this\ndistribution. Could you arrange to have approximately 100 of these sent to me\neach time they are published and we will distribute them to all the member stations?\nAs usual the stations are looking forward to another successful winter\nof forums. It is .really true that the acceptance of these long talks somewhat\nflabbergast the older radio personnel.\nWith warmest regards, I am\nCordially,\n/s/ Richard L. Rider\nRLRjWC\nEnc.\nRichard L« Ridar\nManager"
