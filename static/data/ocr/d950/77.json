Keith Tyler of Ohio\nState and of the NAEB Research Committee, The seminar brought together\nresearchers in tangential fields for the purpose of laying out some of\nthe problems on which research is is needed for educational broadcasting\nand to point out some of the ways in which these problems can be attacked.\nIt is hoped that the summary of the conference results, now being consoli¬\ndated by Dr, Tyler, will provide some guideposts and inspiration for much\nadditional research by educational stations, educational institutions,\nand research agencies*\nFortunately, the NAEB Board of Directors made it possible for the\ngrants-in-aid program, started in 1955-1956, to continue during this\npast year. The NAEB can take credit for making possible some excellent\nresearch projects, with the expenditure of comparatively little money,\nthrough this partial support of research projects* The announcements\nfor the 1958-1959 program of grants should now be in the hands of NAEB\nmembers and others interested in research of significance to educational\nbroadcasting. A special attempt was made to get these announcements out\nearly this year so that greater time and thought can be given to the\npreparation of research proposals."
