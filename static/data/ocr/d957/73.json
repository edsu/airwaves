MR PRANK SCHOOLEY\nUNIVERSITY OP URBANA (ILL)\nDEFINITELY INTERESTED IN OFFER CONTAINED YOUR WIRE OP\nSEPTEMBER 12th RECEIVED ONLY TODAY IP PERMANENT STOP\nAPPRECIATE FURTHER INFO STOP AVAILABLE MAY STOP\nH J SKORNIA*\n2o By way of explanation, the embassy in Vienna didn®t deliver\nthe wire to Skomia for some reason. Some flunky\nthought it was a broadside looking for help. It found\nway back to Urbana, in hands of a State department\nrepresentative, who called me to see why I°d sent that\ncable to Austria. I told him in no uncertain terms\nwhat I thought about failure to deliver. He sent fast\nword back to Vienna.\n3. If I may suggest, I believe this now calls for some\nletter of explanation by the chairman, Graydon Ausmuso\nI merely suggest this so that matter isn8t left undone.\nIf I am to act further regarding Skomia, Ausmus please\nadvise.\n10-9-52"
