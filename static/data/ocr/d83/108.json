Some¬\ntimes I feel as if I am off in the wilderness—\nso far removed from the NAEB office, and\nnestled so quietly in the confines of the\nUniversity. However, it has been an interesting\nexperience working with Prof. McLuhan here.\nWould very much like the address of Mr.\nR. J. Coleman, Rose. Would you mind sending\nit along to me? There are a few matters I have\nasked Prof. McLuhan to clear up for me before\nthe end of the project. Will send a copy of his\nletter to you and Mr. Hill.\nThank you again.\nSincerely,"
