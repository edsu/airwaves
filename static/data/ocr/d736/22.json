  "text": "Through the Crusade for Freedom, organized in\n1950 by General Lucius D. Clay and now led by\nHenry Ford II, the American public actively partici¬\npates in the Committee’s work. In two years 25,000,-\n000 Americans have given several million dollars to\nhelp set up and expand Radio Free Europe’s facilities.\nIn 1950 the Crusade installed in Berlin the famed\nFreedom Bell, symbol of the Committee’s efforts to\nrestore liberty to the oppressed. The dedication of the\nFreedom Bell was witnessed by 400,000 Berliners,\n100,000 of whom risked the trip from the Soviet sec¬\ntor. At the end of each RFE program four notes of the\nbell are heard, with the words: “That was the Freedom\nBell to remind you that this is Radio Free Europe.”\nDuring the summer of 1951 the Crusade launched\na dramatic balloon campaign, distributing millions of\nleaflets behind the Iron Curtain via the “Winds of\nFreedom.” This daring project infuriated the Com¬\nmunists and forced them to dispatch special squads of\nsecurity police to pick up the leaflets. It caught the\nimagination of the free world. Most important, it\nproved to the subjugated peoples that they are not\nforgotten by the West.\nThis year the Crusade for Freedom has intensified\nits campaign to support the Committee’s program of\naction against Communism. The Crusade has set a\ngoal of $4,000,000 to increase the effectiveness of\nRadio Free Europe. It will also give support to Radio\nFree Asia’s efforts to penetrate the “Bamboo Curtain.”\nAct now. Your help is urgently needed. Send\nyour contribution to Crusade for Freedom, c/o Local\nPostmaster. Help Truth Fight Communism."
