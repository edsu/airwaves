  "text": "TELEVISION LESSON\nExcept for the first paragraph*, this section of\nlesson is not seen on screen.\nTeacher in ocean depths set. She is in classroom dress...seated on a\ntractor. Near her there is a vacuum cleaner...a pressure cooker. The dogfish\nis tethered to a tall sea plant. An axe is within reach.\nIn answer to the three questions in the introduction, the teacher on\nscreen answers:\n*\"Right here. Where I am. In the depths of the briny, treacherous,\nbeautiful, vast, and fertile ocean* How did I get here? The same way YOU get\nlots of places where YOU want to be but can't go. By imagination!\"\nShe says there is plenty of room for imagination in this new strange\nworld of water...not only because of the size (The Continental Shelf alone is as\nbig as Asia)...but because so little is known about it that we are discovering\nnew things every day. Things here are very different from the world as we know\nit. Just as our ancestors..-moving from Europe to America... or from the forests\nof the new land to the grassy plains farther west...found that their old ways\nof living, thinking, and doing didn’t fit their new situation, so our scientists\nexploring the ocean today are constantly meeting new dangers, new conditions,\nnew problems.\nJust picture to yourself, she says, this skillful hero of the timbered\nregions (SHE SHOWS A PICTURE OF A RUGGED PIONEER FELLING A TREE TO BUILD A\nCABIN OR CHOPPING FIRE WOOD) out in the middle of the rolling prairie without\na tree in sight. Don’t you imagine he must have felt that this axe (SHE EXHIBITS\nAXE) was about the most useless tool he could imagine.\nAbout as useless as what else you see? (SHE LOOKS AROUND AT THE\nVACUUM CLEANER, THE PRESSURE COOKER.. .THEN DOWN AT THE TRACTOR.) That’s right.\nThe familiar tools, the familiar ways of doing things...won’t work."
