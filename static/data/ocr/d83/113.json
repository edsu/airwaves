Skomia,\nNAEB,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Ill.\np*\nDear Harry:\ni\nEnclosed letter from Lee Dreyfus shows that things\nare moving. I want to get your approval for diverting\nsay $100 of my travel money to enable Art Knowles (my\npart time assistant from the National Film Board) to spend\nfour or five days in Detroit working on the matters that\nare indicated in the Dreyfus letter.\nIf it should be easier to use funds in the budget\nfor film and videos for this purpose, its all one to me.\nAlso, I have kept forgetting to ask you whether\nyou consider the occasional book a legitimate part of my\nexpenses in the project. As you are well aware, for anybody\nmaking up a syllabus on the teaching of media, there are\na good many books appearing from month to month which are\nnot accessible in public libraries. So far I think I have\nbought about four or five such books.\nMost cordially."
