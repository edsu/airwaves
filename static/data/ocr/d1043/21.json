At this point of the program I fade out and\nyou fade in* Your board is going to set the policy for the project, within the\nlimits and conditions of the grant, and your representatives are going to execute\nthat policy. The grant is to the University of Illinois, but in a very real\nsense, therefore, it is your grant. This is your cue* You are on the air."
