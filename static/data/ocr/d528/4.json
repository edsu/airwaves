Mott\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bob,\nYour bulletin, #73, of May 29, 1970, gives us real concern. From\nthe beginning of CPB we have given assurance to our administration here at\nBrigham Young University that CPB was an independent public corporation,\nactually separated from the government of this country. It would appear to\nus that if Section Three amended Section 399 of the 1934 Communications\nAct, is passed by the Senate, all that we have said and CPB has said, as\nwell as Congress, in passing the Public Broadcasting Act, is refuted.\nIf Congress is passing rules for the CPB, reaching through the Corp¬\noration's actions to qualify the spending of monies by CPB, it would appear\nthat the element of \"independence\" is somewhat farcical and nonexistent.\nWe do not object to making audio or video tape recordings and sub¬\nmitting these to CPB, but feel that this request should come from CPB and\nnot through Congressional Act. Perhaps we don't understand this proposal\ncorrectly, but this is the interpretation we find in the language in the pro¬\nposed amendment as printed in your bulletin.\nCordially,\nEarl J. Glade, Jr\nDirector\nEJGJ:cmw\ncc: Donald Quayle"
