  "text": "11\n2) Regional; The ten provinces are grouped into three regions and programs\nare planned and presented jointly. Provincial curricula are taken into\nconsideration and as far as possible programs fit into the general pro¬\ngram.\n3) National: These programs are presented by the Canadian Broadcasting\nCorporation on the advice of the National Advisory Council on School\nBroadcasts. The subject of these programs centers around Canadian citi¬\nzenship and unity. The complete presentation of a Shakespearian play\nis part of the National series each year.\nU) International: These are international exchange programs from members\nof the British Commonwealth of Nations.\nB) Each Provincial office produces one-half hour of programming a day. School\nbroadcast supervisors plan programs to aid teachers - a few are of a direct\nteaching type, but most of the programs are planned to supplement the work\nof the teacher, especially on the imaginative side.\nC) School Broadcast Supervisors have the advantage of working with the best\nproducers, actors and technicians in the CBC. For dramatic scripts, pro¬\nfessional writers are used and since programs are planned at least one\nyear in advance, these writers are able to sit in on the early planning con¬\nferences of the educational \"experts” in the various subject matter fields.\nThe philosophy is to use the daily half-hour of broadcast time to present\nsomething from which even the best-qualified teachers feel their classes\ncan profit. Script writers are provided with the basic material to be\nused in each program, and they are able to consult with the Supervisor of\nSchool Broadcasts and class-room teachers at any time. Then the writers\nare given free rein in the treatment of these materials, but know full well\nthat School Broadcast Supervisors do not hesitate to ask for re-writes."
