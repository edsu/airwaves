Unfortunately the earlier\nletter referred to was not available so I don’t have the specific\ndetails*\nHowever, it seems possible that we might be caught under wording\nas general a s may be expected in such legislation. Most institu¬\ntions engage in one way or another in publishing activities or\nrecording activities which might make them vulnerable*\nWe urge that NAEB give careful attention to securing provision\nin the proposed legislation t o prevent unfortunate restrictions on\neducational institutions’ activities, and that we be notified in\ncase our help is needed in securing the changes needed.\nI’m sorry we can’t be more specific; but without proper sources\nto refer to we can only express our feelings in a general way*\nSincerely yours.\n>ld A^ AEpgel\nHAEsjc"
