I\nhave had sTfew expressions of interest, but no definite\ncommitmentsT* '\"\"Dolour records show any new members at all\nsince October 20?\nAlso Ifd jrfee some information about AERT chapters. I\nhave been telling some of my prospects that an AERT chapter\nhere in Connecticut would help to develop a group made up\nof both lay citizens and professional educators who could\nbe expected to have some background knowledge of educational\nbroadcasting problems. Where are state and local chapters\nto be found now? And can you easily add the number of mem¬\nbers in each? What is the total membership of the AERT?\nDo you have membership application blanks?' If so, I\ncould use a few, as well as any other promotional material\navailable.\nWith the best greetings of the season.\nSincerely yours"
