There are three different sections _ for\nbeginning, intermediate and advanced students. Courses include the study of the language,\ncivil history, art history, philosophy, literature, and one devoted entirely to Dante's\n\"Divine Comedy.\"\nIn the 33 years of its existence, the University for Foreigners has enrolled some\n17,000 students from 78 different nations.\nThe biggest single group of students has come from Germany, with Americans second.\nBut the annual invasion of American Fulbright grantees for their month of special orienta¬\ntion is closing the gap.\nThat American invasion this year came on Sunday, September 26.
