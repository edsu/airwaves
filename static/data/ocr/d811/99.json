The network became self-support¬\ning within five years, and now distributes recorded educa¬\ntional programs at the rate of a thousand tape recordings a\nweek.\nWhile NAEB headquarters is slowly achieving self-support\nitself, part of the present grant will be used to carry on\nits regular services* Dr. Skomia said that the funds will\nallow the NAEB to hire a full-time editor for its various\npublications.
