Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nThanks for your June 15 letter and enclosures.\nI would be willing to look over any proposal you might want to submit\nanytime, but I can't be very optimistic about a possible affirmative reaction\nto one that seeks \"the creation of a profession of educational broadcasters\nand creation of standards. \"\nI wonder off-hand if professions are \"created\" in this way, if we do not\nrun immediately into all of the problems that sooner or later confront all\ngroups that seek \"professional\" status, and if perhaps the way this is done is\nnot through long-term high quality performance, the emergence of a literature,\nthe development of professional education, and the forward movement of the\nother trappings of professional status.\nIsn't this the kind of thing we should talk about at some length before you\ngo to the trouble of preparing a formal proposal? It's a complicated and comÂ¬\nplex subject which I'm sure would be worth exploring in some form but for\nwhich I am doubtful that we could do much, if anything.\nI'd like to attend your Washington meeting in September -- for the subject,\nas you know, is one in which we're interested -- but I have some long-delayed\ncommitments on the date of your meeting and will hence not be able to attend.\nSincerely,"
