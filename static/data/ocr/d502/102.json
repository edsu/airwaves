Novik\nSeptember 10, 1951*\nOraydonj\nI meant to got this note off to you sooner#\nI spent three hours -with Ken Yard August 30th\nand met Bob Hudson and Mr. Woodbum# X now have a\nbetter idea of the general problem. The immediate\nproblem is getting AFTRA to recognise the special\nposition of educational, non-commercial TV stations\nand give them special consideration as IEEW and\nIATSE are doing with the engineers.\nI have told them frankly that I didn-t ant\nto get into this until T talked to you two guys and\nalso discussed it informally with neorge Heller,\nthe head of AFTRA. I made it very clear that I did\nnot fant to do anything that would jeopardize NAEB.\nI have a feeling that because they have Ford support,\nit makes it harder to get concessions for them than\nfor an individual, non-commercial, educational TV\nstation. I*m not looking for new clients, but I\nrealize the importance of the Canter to the develop¬\nment of the existing and future stations. Will you\ngive me your off-the-record guidance? I it 11 be spend¬\ning a lot of time with Heller in the next three weeks.\nIf you* re near TV Monday, September 20 at 8:00\nI suggest you turn on NBC for the Amy salute to the\nentertainers, (Goerge and I have been cooking this\none up for over six months and it1 a something that X\nhave been thinking about for a couple of.jrears).\nNAEB\nMSNjck\ncci Harry Skomia\n?i?i¥iiO(ii,i\ni"
