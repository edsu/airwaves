  "text": "A Look at\nSOCIALISM\nThis is the first of a bracket of three films examin¬\ning the major political and economic systems of\nthe world today. Starting with Webster’s definition,\nthe philosophy, the substance, the origin and the\nrecord of Socialism in practice are objectively\nstudied—through dramatizations, actual film foot¬\nage made in England, and the many other interest¬\ning facts at hand. England under the Socialist-Labor\ngovernment serves as an example of Socialism in\npractice. Documented facts are presented to show\nthat the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx is the\ncommon inspiration for British Socialism as well\nas Russian Communism. The miserable plight of a\npeople living under Socialism is Documented.\nThe lesson here is: the theory of Socialism may be\nexciting; its promises glittering; but in actual\npractice it leads to poverty and loss of individual\nfreedom.\nLeft: The common origin of\ncommunism and socialism is\ndocumented through this cen¬\ntennial edition of the mani¬\nfesto published by Britain’s\nSocialist Party. Right: a\nweek's ration of these food\nitems dramatizes Britain's\n“Austerity\" under Socialism."
