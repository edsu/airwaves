The group ihowed li;tle\nInto1 suggested \"seriec on Education in the Modtrn World. But\nwo thought that member stations would indeed like to h&v» a resumption\nof Invitation to Read and Window^in the Ivory Tower.\nWe all feel that it would be presumptuous to ask Dr. C# stall f:<r an\naudition tape, so skip it.
