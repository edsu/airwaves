We must\nestablish contact with reliable capabilities for\nthe production of the \"software\" materials, to\nreinforce our efforts with the mass communications\nmedia.\nIn New York City, plans are underway for the develop¬\nment of an educational experiment at the Elementary\nSchool level, with a device known as the Talking\nTypewriter. This instrument affords us the opportunity\nto test the concept of \"Responsive Environment\" in\na controlled way. In a New York Times article,\n(Oct. 28, 1966) this technique is described in\nthe following way: \"When a child touches a key,\nthe machine not only prints a letter, but pro¬\nnounces the letter, figure or symbol. Later the\nmachine displays and pronounces letters for the\npupil to type, and progresses to words and sentences.\"\nTelevision has been included as part of this ex¬\nperiment, so that hopefully, that experience can\nbe replicated in other geographical areas, shared\nwith other people working in similar areas of concern."
