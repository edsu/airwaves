As Pascal said \"Sorry, I didn't have time to make them\n^shorter.\" And if you have any criticisms, fellows, will you please shoot\nthem direct at me? I liked John’s direct recent letter re. my not giving\ntime to reply, on that score. (I could reply about being caught between\nthe need to do something and need to get responses, but 1 think you all\nknow the feeling). I’ll try to be equally honest and frank with you.\nSorry I can t be any other way.\nOne things if the Hewglfttep is to carry neyg of members,\nRegional Directors will haye to help us. Can not canvas every member\nindividually. Pleasel"
