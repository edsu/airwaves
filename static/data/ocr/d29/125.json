We certainly want to avoid\nany “double taxation/' If we find that you are liable for tax in both coun¬\ntries, it might be possible to work out some sort of “grant\" to your univer¬\nsity for your salary, and they could then pay you.\nIf you'll look into both matters up there, i.e., your liability for Canadian\ntax and the possibility of a grant to the university for your salary, and\nadvise me fully. I'll then proceed to assemble all available information\nfrom both countries so the best decision can be made by all of us,\nI don't think there will be any problem on the secretary or the graduate\nassistant because they will receive less than $5,000 a year each.\nCordially\nHarplct E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nhehirs"
