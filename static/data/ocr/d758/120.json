We will\nno longer have separate sections for Actives, Associates, and\nAffiliates — an arrangement which has always been confusing —\nbut will indicate these categories within the listings by states.\nThis Directory will go only to the institutional, sustaining, and\nindustrial associations, thus saving more money.\n4. Your letter has prompteduus to take action on the “Welcome\nLetter *. We have referred this to a special committee com¬\nposed of three members of the Public Relations Committee plus\nLew Rhodes, Vice Chairman of the committee for Individual\nMembers, asking that a newer and better letter be prepared,\nwhich we will then have printed rather than mimeographed.\n5. Thanks for the kind comments on the Journal and the Newsletter.\nI am particularly pleased with the new heading on the latter and\nbelieve it is really getting to look very professional. Harold\nand I are trying to work out arrangements to have it issued twice\na month in order to keep abreast of fast-popping news.\nFinally, thank you for your taking the time and trouble to react to these\nmaterials. Never hesitate to fire off a letter of this nature, because we find\nsuch sophisticated judgments especially helpful.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G.
