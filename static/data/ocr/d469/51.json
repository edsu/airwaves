  "text": "-6-\nMoving now to Section I in this qualifying heat of the rainbow,\nwe are immediately confronted with one of the most critical hurdles of\nall, (for if you don’t clear this one, the race is over for you), and that is\nthe legal qualifications of the applicant. Substantiating your organization’s\neligibility as an applicant completes two of the five assurances specifically\nrequired in the Act, The kind of documentation you must provide is\nindicated in this section.\nIn Section I you will have indicated the category in which your organization\nfalls. In Section II (pg.3) Exhibit 2A, you are required to document it\naccording to the definitions and requirements set forth in the program’s\nRegulations and Instructional Manual,\nA few of you who may be representing a high school (or some other\ninstitution under your State Board of Education) probably will find you are\nlegally eligible to qualify in Category 1,\nOthers of you who can document that your organization is a bona fide\nState Radio Agency will find you can readily qualify under Category 2,\nMost of you fall in the third category - a college or university - no\nproblem for some, but a real stickler for others. A college or university,\nto be eligible, must receive direct and continuing State or local tax revenues\nfor a current academic program of instruction for which credit is offered at\nthe higher education level. ■If your.institution is privately supported, it is\nineligible,\nSome of the stations represented here may be eligible under category 4 as\na non-profit corporation. An applicant wishing to qualify as an eligible\nnonprofit corporation, foundation, or association must provide documentation\nto substantiate that the applicant is so organized as to be reasonably\nrepresentative of the educationa, cultural, and civic groups in the community"
