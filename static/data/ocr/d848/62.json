You see, she explains, \"weeds\" to\na fish farmer aren't plants. They're tiny, inedible creatures like this brittle\nstar (SHE EXHIBITS A BRITTLE STAR OR FACSIMILE) and this starfish (SHE EXHIBITS\nA STARFISH OR FACSIMILE.) These, we are told, eat all but a tiny percentage of\nthe fish food in the sea. You need a tractor all right, says the teacher,\nbut explains that to clear these weeds, she'll probably have to trade hers in\non a pressure-proof submarine.\nEven then, points out the teacher, fish farming wouldn't be easy. How\ncan we get our fish-crops to \"stay put\" and grow.. .instead of swimming away.\nShe mentions fences with which scientists are experimenting, based on what is\nknown about how fish react to color, noise, disturbed water. If these don't\nwork, she says, she may have to give up aquaculture.\nOf course, says the teacher, I might take up whale ranching. It is\nclaimed that this could be a very profitable in the future, because, in addition\nto everything else she has of value, a mother whale gives a ton of milie a day.\n]y&ybe she'd even teach me to breathe under water, says the teacher.\nShe says she knows some scientists predict man will someday be able to have\ngills imposed by surgery. But she doesn't want gills. She'd rather get the\nwhale to tell her the whale's breathing secret. Then, looking straight at the\nclass, the teacher leaves a provocative question for the pupils' consideration.\n\"What could that secret be?\""
