If not, is it\nO.K. if we attach with the next Newsletter the material we had\nalready stenciled on this (I'll be glad to let you see it in\nadvance) which at least reveals the rules involved.\nLike Hill whose comments 81*6 attached, I wondered a bit at the\n\"approximately $1*00? I also wonder about whether separate entry\nfees beyond dues are required.\nOn the Lowell thing, it will be nice to have any definite infor¬\nmation which Mr. Lowell can provide. Before you send it, how¬\never, I suggest you check the fiscal report George provided.\nI believe I gave you a copy. If not I'll be glad to bring you\nthe file cqpf I have, attached to the unsent letter from Ausraus\nwhich Probst drafted for him.\nHarry J. Skomia"
