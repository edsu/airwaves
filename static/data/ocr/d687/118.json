I see that the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters will be holding\nits annual meeting in New York City October 27-30.\nWill you fill me in on the NAEB and who makes up its membership, and\nhow it serves the educational field? As you know we are\nmoving into a pretty extensive program in the educational\nfields of both radio and television, and it occurs to me\nthat probably we should have a membership in NAEB.\nDo institutions take out memberships, or are memberships held by indiÂ¬\nviduals who teach and work in the field of educational\nbroadcasting? If institutions hold memberships what is\nthe annual fee, and if individuals hold memberships what\nis such fee?\nPerhaps answers to the above questions will set me straight on the\nforthcoming convention, but I am interested to know if\nyou think we should be represented at that meeting. I\nshall appreciate any of your suggestions in regard to\nour future relationships with this Association.\nIncidentally, we are going ahead with construction of our studios for\nboth radio and television, but will have to await action\nof Legislature next spring before we can proceed in\nequipping the television studios. I see frequent mention\nof your program and its progress, and while I suspect\nyou are not getting everything you want, I hope you are\ngetting sufficient support for an adequate job.\nWith sincere personal regards, I am\nCordially yours.\nROW/baa\nRae 0.
