Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nNational Association of\nL\nEducational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harold:\nWell, I see that the Hill family is going to pickup bag and\nbaggage and leave Champaign for our nation’s capital. I\nhope you enjoy becoming a big city boy, but I -would be will¬\ning to bet that you will miss the cheerful atmosphere of\nUrbana-Champaign.\nThe purpose of this letter is to inquire as to the makeup of\nthe Public Relations Committee of the NAEB for the current\nyear. One or two members of last year’s committee have come\nto me with projects, but since it is my feeling that we have\nno status currently, I have bottled up such activities.\nFurthermore, I have a promotion idea that I would like to\npresent to the new committee, so will you clarify this matter\nfor me at your convenience.\nGive my best to Betty.\nEGS:mm"
