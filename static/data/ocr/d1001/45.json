THE OPENING SEC¬\nTION IS AN ON-THE-SPOT DESCRIPTION OF NORTH AFRICA MADE BY MrS. COREY\nAS HER PLANE LANDED IN LIBYA. A SECOND REPORT PRESENTS MRS. WANCY\nCOLLINGS, WIFE OF A RETIRED BRITISH ARMY GENERAL, WHO LIVED FOR MANY\nyears in Africa and the Near East. Interviewed in New York by KSLH\nSTAFF MEMBERS WHO MET HER WHILE ATTENDING A CONVENTION, SHE GIVES\nA FIRST-HAND ACCOUNT OF A VISIT TO THE DESERT TENT HOMES OF THE\nBeduoin Arabs. In the third part of the broadcast, Wassef Youssef\nWassef, student of clinical psychology at Washington University and\nnative of Cairo, describes a trip to the oasis of Siwa, \"Egypt. Be¬\ntween EACH REPORT COMMENTS BY A NARRATOR POINT UP THE SIGNIFICANCE\nOF THE MATERIAL, SET THE SCENE FOR THE NEXT REPORTER, OR ADD PER¬\nTINENT INFORMATION.\nReactions to the first series of seven programs indicate that they\nARE FILLING A REAL NEED FOR TEACHERS BY STIMULATING BOYS AND GIRLS\nTO WANT TO KNOW THEIR WORLD NEIGHBORS.\n--Ken Wright, WUOT"
