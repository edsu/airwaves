Art Director of the\nRoyal Ontario Museum, who has worked for years with me\non the effects of print. He is a trained typographer\nhimself. He makes it possible for us to be completely\nspontaneous and to dispense with script.\nBob Shafer makes the third member of the dialogue\nteam. He has offered to chip in a few hundred dollars\ntowards the cost of this video. It fits very well the\nneeds of his own project in teacher training.\nHere are the expenses that Parker and I incurred:\nAir porters and cabs 11.50\nReturn air trip for 2 $58.00\nHotel for 2 28.45\nMeals for 2 (two days)\nTOTAL\n30.00\n$127.95\nVery best regards.\nMarshall McLuhan"
