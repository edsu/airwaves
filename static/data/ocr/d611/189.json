Because of the heightened interest in educational\nbroadcasting’s role for the disadvantaged and because of the obvious\ninterest being demonstrated by this field’s capital resources I\nwonder if money can be found not only to continue your current\nactivity but to supplement it with actual program examples of what\nis being transmitted and reports on the success, almost-success or\nthe failure of the projects. It seems to me that such a rounded\ninformation service could serve as a fine demonstration basis for\nthe whole of the field as well as for those interested in what we\nare doing.\nThe real stuff of this letter was to be a request that you\nkeep your ears tuned on our behalf for anything in the area of\ninstructional television for the disadvantaged. Would you?\nBest wishes,\nEdward J.' Pfister\nDirector\nInformation Services\nEJP/mh\ncc: Chalmers Marquis"
