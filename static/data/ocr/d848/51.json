That the classroom teacher must know the\ngeneral purpose of the series (enrichment,\ndirect teaching, major resource, etc.)\nas well as the goal or puipose of the\nspecific lesson - as it has been developed\nby the television teacher.\n2. That the classroom teacher must select the\nfollow-through that will be most meaningful\nfor his particular class at this particular\ntime.\n3. That activities which are appropriate for\ndeveloping skills are not necessarily those\nmost appropriate for developing attitudes\nor reinforcing knowledge or establishing\nvalues; that is, the activity is not good or\nbad per se but as it relates to the goal to\nbe achieved.\n4. That the television teacher and classroom\nteacher are a team in the learning situation\nwith the television teacher's major respon¬\nsibility centered on the content and the\nclassroom teacher's major responsibility\nfocused on individual students.\n5. That the television teacher's primary concern\nmust be on the elements common to all learners\nwhile the classroom teacher's primary concern\nmust be on the individual differences of\nlearners."
