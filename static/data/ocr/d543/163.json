Toward this end there must be devel¬\noped a body of educational broadcasting practitioners - with its own\nstandards, professional publication, esprit de corps, respected status -\nwelded into a true profession under the leadership and banner of NAEB.\nOur new individual membership classification now has 300; it ought\nto be 3,000 - or more. Heretofore, nearly all of us have thought of\nNAEB in terms of participation via the membership of our institutions.\nX want to change this concept into an awareness of the need for parti¬\ncipation as individuals in a professional group meeting their needs\nfor growth and development and lending them stature and status.\nSince this institutional orientation is strong it will take some\ndoing. As a first step, important in its influence on others, I should\nlike to be able to enroll all of the Officers and Directors as indi¬\nvidual members. Seven already are members; I'd like to make it 100%.\nThere is no coercion intended here, of course; but X would certainly\nappreciate it if you could make this (tax free) commitment as an earnest\nof your belief in the role of NAEB as a professional association.\nVery cordially yours.\nWilliam G, Harley\nWGH: jc\nP.S. Jack White has committed his administrative staff of the Center\nto taking out Individual membership in NAEB."
