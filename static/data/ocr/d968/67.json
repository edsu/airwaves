JAMES R- KILLIAN JR.,\non bis visit to Buffalo this week,\nstrongly supported National\nEducational Television u\\ET>\nas the logical agency for han¬\ndling a national TV news sen-\nice for noncommercial stations.\nThis follows the «*ent re¬\nport of the, Carnegie Com-\nmission »i> Etlucational rele-\nvision, which Killian headed.\nNET already services most of\nthe nation’s ETV stations with\ntaped and filmed programs dis¬\ntributed by mail.\nKILLIAN also stressed his fa¬\nvoring of local-station autonomy\nin the event of a national public\nnetwork, and the importance of\nfinancial stability for ETV.\nThis . support has naturally\ncheered local ETV station mam\naeers but there’s a group of\neducational broadcaster* which\nis not so happy.\nThese are the men Involved « j\neducational radio statiohs, ^ ,\nBill Siemering of the State Uni\nversity of Buffalos WBFO-tM.\nAS SIEMERING says,\n“there has been much dis-\neussioit about educational TV. i\nbut many people are perhaps j\nunaware that educational radio\nis also included in proposed fed¬\neral legislation.\"\nThe National Educational Ra¬\ndio Network, of which WUl-0 is\na member, is also under study\nin hearings now going on before\nthe senate Communicauons\nSubcommittee (John F. White.\nNET president, speaks on\nhearing session aired on U1. r*\nat 9 tonight).\nA RADIO NETWORK spokes¬\nman, Jack Burke, says \"oui\nstory is one of incredibly \\ow\nbudgets, services to forgotten\naudiences, and bold plans for\nmeeting broad social and cut\ntural needs of the local* com¬\nmunity, statewide audiences\nand the nation as a whole.\n“Through the use of niidti-\nulexuig - whore three or more\nradio signals can be aired\nsimultaneously - (aild, t^®.\ndevelopment of statewide and\nregional networks, educational\nradio should be no longer the\nhidden medium.\n“AFTF.lt 45 YEARS, the\nport we’re placing before the\nsenators mav result in emcr\npence of a strong medium.\nOne result of the hearings,\nchaired by Sen.

Warren G. Mag™*\nson’s bill, called the Public\nTelevision Act. also provides,\nfor the first time, financial sup-\n! port for noncommercial radio.\nI The radiomen, who a wnile\nago staged a demonstration of\ntheir own \"live 1111 e ,r‘\nconnection w i t h nationwid\nbroadcast of West German elec¬\ntion returns, are looking hope\nfully to the future.\nTHEY HOPF. that, ill a world\nof globe-girdling TV satellites,\nthe public will recognize edu- |\ncational radio has something to {\noffer as well.\nAs Fred W.
