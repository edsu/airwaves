I have seen American iromen look lovely at a\ngarden party or cocktail party in modified Japanese styling.\nYou know, in conclusion I wonder how long the Japanese\ncan keep up this double existence of wearing both Japanese\nand Western clothing? They are completely different.\nAnd yet combining the two v/ould result in the loss of\ncharacteristic beauty of both. This means we should not\nregard the tvro as requiring a double existence. Or, wake\nup in the morning in Tokyo and say: Shall I be Japanese\nor Western today? But we must plan our lives over here in\nsuch a way as to preserve the individual merits of both\ntypes, and make them practical.\nOur thanks to you Miss Aiko Kitaoka, costume designer and\nmodel in Tokyo. (PAUSE). This is John Lerch bidding you\nseyonara until next week at this time.\nUP AND UNDER\nTape recorded each week in Tokyo, REPORT FROM JAPAN is\nwritten and produced by John Lerch.\nUP AND OUT\n( END )"
