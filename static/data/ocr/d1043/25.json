Rider;\nYou will receive shortly our check for $37*50 to cover WNUR’s service\nassessment fee for NAEB Tape Network programs, covering the period\nJanuary 1, 1952, to June 30, 1952.\nYJNUR understands the reasons for this fee and is very happy to cooperate\nin helping to finance the fine service received from NAEB Tape Network\nHeadquarters5 however, both Don Feddersen and I feel that perhaps a\ncloser examination of statical classifications for purposes of these fees\nis in ordero We feel that the present classification system which in¬\ncludes 10 watt FM stations in the general group of stations with less\nthan 1 KW of power is somewhat unfair financiallyo I should imagine that\nmost 250 watt educational FM stations, for exsjrple, would be in a con¬\nsiderably better financial position than that in which most 10 watt FM\nstations find themselves.\nI hope that you understand our suggestion. It means that although we\nrecognize the espenses of the NAEB Tape Network operation, and despite\nour admiration for your splendid program service, WNUR may find itself in\nthe unfortunate position of being unable to afford the rising cost of the\nTape Network programs. We hope that a fourth classification for 10 watt\nFM stations will be made.\nSincerely,\nRADIO STATION WNUR\n/s/ BUI Butler\nW. L. Butler, Jr.\nStation Manager"
