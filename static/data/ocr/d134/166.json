For such demonstrations\ninstallations in various parts of the XJ.S. would provide adequate facilities without the need\nfor any central installation.\nVII. Duration: The project proposed would require two years, with periodic publication of\ninterim results.\nThe first year would be devoted principally to experimentation, demonstration, consultation\nand evaluation. The second year would be devoted largely to verification of results and\npreparation of the finished results in publishable form.\nHie form and sponsorship of this publication remain open for discussion; if the Office\nof Educatfon does not itself wish to undertake it. Dr. McLuhan's reputation and the validity\nof the study are such that regular commercial publication is believed to be assured."
