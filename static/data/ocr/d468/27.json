  "text": "11-10\nTOCs\nNew York City right now for the Tammany Society dinner.\nWhat is the Tammany Society?\nSCHER:\nYou’ll find out. Now Ilve made all the arrangement. Mr. Morse who’s\na judge at Cherry Valley, he’ll introduce. Morse is a friend of mine;\nnice fellow. I’ve written it down for you; here’s the address.\nLANDLADY:\n(COMING ON)\nPardon me, gentlemen; there’s three gentlemen to see Mr. Tocqueville\nand Mr. Beaumont. Here’s their cards.\nSCHER;\nLet me see. I don’t know these fellows: but this is the New York\nEvening Post. Old Bryant’s got one of his men on the job. Well, do\nwhat you like with them; but don’t forget you’re going to see Governor\nThroop tomorrow.\nMJSICs\nTILL TOMORROW.\nSOUND;\nCARRIAGES AND HORSES\nTOC:\nWhat a scene of hurry and bustle in these streets. I wonder if all this\nrunning is typical of a democracy. You notice everybody overtakes us.\nI thought myself a lively enough walker; but over here, I seem only to\ndawdle. Why do the citizens of a democracy hurry?\nBEAU:\nHow do we know, Tocqueville, these are typical citizens? Elsewhere,\nthings may be very different. This New York is only on city in a vast\ncountry: do not begin, I beg you, to build your theories, until you have\nmore facts. I wonder what this Governor Throop is going to be like.\nTOC:\nThey say he is very pleasant. I took a few notes: he is forty seven\nyears old; formally a circuit judge...what is a circuit judge, I\nwonder? and he was only elected this year.\nBEAU:\nWait."
