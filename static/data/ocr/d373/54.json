  "text": "-2-\nRecently I was reading a review of a new edition of John Dewey's\n\"Lectures in the Philosophy of Education,\" originally written in 1399.\nThe review stated that Dewey's philosophy of education \"has only a\nlimited relevance .to the problems in our ’schools and colleges that\nperplex us most.\" The implication, as'I understood it, was that\nDewey's stress on the socialization of the child—that is, the education\nthat could put the child into an effective relationship with and control\nover his environment--was not entirely desirable or successful, as i\nrelated to the potentials and needs in education. Unfortunately, the\nreviewer seems to be further away from the realities of education today\nthan Dewey was 70 years ago. What are the desirable goals of education\ntoday? Combining the instrumentalist, rationalist and eclecticist\nphilosophies, education's goals are, briefly, fourfold: to educate the\nstudent to achieve effective participation as a citizen in the affairs\nof the world; to achieve self-realization; to acquire some degree of\nvocational efficiency; and to attain ethical and aesthetic growth.\nDewey could not do this, seventy years ago.or even thirty years\nago, except in a partial and limited way. Very simply, he could not\ntake every student in every classroom into every corner of the outside\nworld; and he obviously could not bring the world into the classroom.\nI don't have to tell you that we are doing precisely that today in\nevery classroom where the modern media of communication are present\nand are being used."
