The nations in question\nI will continue to have those weapons which they now have.\nThere is no time to lose, New tests increasing the danger\nmust not be allowed to take place. It is important to realise that\neven without new tests the danger will increase during the coming\nyears: a large part of the radioactive elements flung up in the\natmosphere and stratosphere at the nuclear experiments is still there.\nIt will come down only after several years - probably about fifteen.\nThe immediate renunciation of further tests will create\na favourable atmosphere for talks on banning the use of nuclear\nweapons. When this urgently necessary step has been taken such nego¬\ntiations can take place in peace."
