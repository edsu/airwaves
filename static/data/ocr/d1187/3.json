The electronic meter is installed\nin the home receiver, registers everytime the tuning dial is turned, trans¬\nmitting a signal to a central control board. In this manner a complete re¬\ncord of every metered receiving set is obtained, and then can be totalled\nup and averages of the audiences reached. .\nSixty of the meters have already been installed in Philadelphia, and twenty\nmore are being pub in each week, NBC has signed for the new service.\nSindlinger believes the system will prove much more effective than present\naudience sampling methods of random telephone calls. He expects his meter\nto show that radio listeners are more discriminating, than generally believed."
