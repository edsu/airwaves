  "text": "December 21, 1955\nMr. Earl Wynn\nCommunications Center\nThe University of North Carolina\nChapel Hill, North Carolina\nDear Earl:\nHarry Skornia and my planning sub-committee met in Chicago on December 3,\njust a day or so after I received a copy of your letter to Harry about the\n’’American Accents” show. I presented the idea to them, of course, and the\nresponse was generally favorable.\nWe are not recommending as a committee that the program be one of the\nfirst three selected for consideration as a prestige series; we really have\ntoo little information for that. But the group certainly thought that the\nidea was worth a grant if it could be worked out. There was some concern\nover two things; what seemed to us from your necessarily sketchy outline a\nlack of unity and central purpose for the entire series, and some doubt\nabout the mechanical problems involved in long distance pick-ups. I’m sure\nyou oan answer these objections without any trouble. Otherwise, the idea\nseemed an exciting one to Skornia, Eitzen, Vogl, and me.\nYou’ll be interested in knowing that the three areas which we are re¬\ncommending for a prestige treatment are (1) \"What Industrialization Means\nto America”, (2) some aspect of mental health, and (3) Geriatrics. We\nfeel that all three are related to the general confusion of our time and\nour adding machine society, and therefore each series is somewhat connected\nwith the other two.\n1 hope that you can work out detailed plans of the ’’Accents” idea, and\nsubmit them for a grant to the Center, You can do this through me, if you\nlike, or through NAEB headquarters.\nSincerely,\nKenneth D. Wright\nDirector of Broadcasting\nKW :ss"
