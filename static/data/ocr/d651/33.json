Please call me as soon as you have read It in order\nto give me any suggestions and changes you feel are indicated.\nAs you know, Loren Stone has seen fit to circularise the station managers\nwith memoranda of his own on this matter, which I feel are highly misleading,\nMy memo is an attempt to clear up some of this misunderstanding and\ncounteract the impression which his comments have created,\nLargely as a result of his memoranda we have had a number of vigorous\nprotests to the action of the Board from ETV station managers, almost all\nof whom react to the premise which Btone provided, that the TV Board had\nbeen overridden by the full Board. Numbered among these are Burdick, Appy,\nSiegel (Arisona), Morris, Collins (Buffalo), and Crabbe, The latter—to show\nthe seriousness of this situation—has indicated he will not renew his\nmembership.\nI feel that a great deal of this reaction is due to misunderstand resulting\nfrom Loren's stacking of the cards and 1, therefore, feel that it is imperative\nthat this matter receive immediate attention. 1 will be grateful for any\nsuggestions you may have for procedures to follow and changes In the pro¬\nposed memo. Perhaps it might be worthwhile to have this signed by the\nChairman of the TV Board as well.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGB:pw"
