At a recent meeting of the Engineering Committee a request was made\nthat something be done to improve the tapes used on the Network, and the Engineering\nCommittee as a whole requested the Network to study the situation and take some\naction.\nYou will recall that in the past the Network has urged its members to return tapes\nof good quality5 these urgings, unfortunately, fell on some deaf ears and all the\nmembers suffered because of this. Therefore, it has become evident that mere\nurgings are not enough.\nSince the major duty of the Network staff is to provide for the common good of all\nthe stations, the following policies have been drafted and will be put into operation\neffective January 1, 1957* These policies have been formulated after considerable\ndiscussion involving both members of the general Headquarters staff and the Network\nstaff, in consultation with the Engineering Committee and the Radio Network Committee,\nWe feel that these are prudent measures and that their initiation will greatly\nassist our constant efforts to make the Network a sound operation, both quality-\nwise and financially.\nRETJ:dfc\n11/26/56"
