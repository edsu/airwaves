This is an excellent idea. Insofar as the\nquantity of tape is concerned I can see no objection to your\nencumbering next year*s budget, if necessary. Certainly the Net¬\nwork must continue to function, and by next year there will undoubtedly\nbe funds available from the contributions of individual member stations*\nSpeaking about service fees, there is a serious doubt\nin my <xm mind as to whether or not a two -bund red~do liar fee could be\njustified in the case of WC*\nIn all of the packets we have received, or which we are\nnow projecting, there is only one series of programs in which we have\nany interest at all, and that is \"Stories and Stuff\"* Koat of the other\nofferings have already been on this station, or originate with us.\nObviously, I feel very strongly about our setting the proper sort of\nexample, but unless some additional compensating factor enters the\npicture, I shall be caught between two fires.\nPerhaps this is enough to write in one letter, but it\nexpresses some ideas which might serve as a point of departure.\n(more)"
