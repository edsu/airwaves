It arrived in the midst of a terrible\ncrisis* My secretary was ill for a week and a half and,\nas you can well imagine, the Television Center was in a very\nchaotic state from which we will not completely recover for\nsome time* Anyway, I want to apologize for the delay in\nresponding and for not having your letter here for reference.\nUnfortunately, I will be unable to make the Ohio State\nInstitute this year. I have recently received notice that I\nwas awarded a grant by the Fund for Adult Education for a year\nof post-doctoral study at Columbia University in the area of\nattitude measurement. This means that I have a great many\nunfinished projects to complete in a hurry. 1 must finish the\nanalysis and report on our experiment in methods of teaching\ncommunications skills for the Fund for the Advancement of\nEducation and must complete another study on audience reaction\nto educational television programs for ETRC before I leave.\nI am already committed to four meetings away from Iowa City\nbefore X leave for the year and do not believe that it will\nbe possible to be away more*\nSorry that I will not be able to make it. It would be\ngood to participate and to see you again. Thank you very\nmuch for the invitation. Again, I hope that you will excuse\nthe delayed response.\nCordially,\nSLB:mw\nSam L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
