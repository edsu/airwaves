  "text": "Teachers to-day face a quite different environment from\nthe one they themselves grew up in. The new problems in\nschool resulting from new procedures, new aids, etc., are\nminor. The big changes are outside in new relations between\nclassroom and community, in the new relevance of higher\neducation to business of production (assembly line now obsolete)\nin the new relation of education to politics and to world\nresponsibilities, in the multi-language situation and in the\nmulti-media world in which print is no longer monarch.\nUnfortunately, the problems for teachers and students,\ncreated by our changing environment, do not disappear when they\nare ignored. In the same way, the unnoticed and non-verbalised\naspects and effects of print, movies, of T.V., do not cease\nto work upon us because neglected. Media do not cease bother¬\ning about us, nor about one another, just because we do not\nbother about them.\nEducation has become everybody8s business in our society.\nThe globe has become a community of learning. The communica¬\ntions industries are many times larger even in capitalization\nthan heavy industry. With learning and teaching becoming the\nbusiness of everybody, round-the-clock, and round-the-globe,\nwhat becomes of the older roles and relations of teacher and\nstudent? Mist both teacher and student become more aware of"
