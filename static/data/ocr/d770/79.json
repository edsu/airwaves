  "text": "NOTES\nAn animated, cartoon in black and white, made very simply*\nExcellent for young children up to 7 years. Music very good.\nDurations 25 minutes. Commentary in English.\nCategory II;\nnLets Draw*1 (Radio Telefis E'ireann, Ireland)\nThe programme unobtrusively induces children, with very simple means, to\noccupy themselves playfully with pencil and brush.\nThe presenter shows the children how to turn chance forms into imaginative\ndrawings simply by using their imagination.\nNOTES\nAn excellent programme for children of 12-15 years. A young\nwoman with an attractive personality and a good voice encourages\nchildren to use their imagination in drawing. Black and white.\nDuration; about 20 minutes. Programme in English.\n\"The Young Bullfighters‚Äù (U.S.S.R. Radio and TV)\nThis contribution is marked by its fascinating tempo, its gratifying humour\nand inescapable hilarity..

Filmed in black and\nwhite. Duration: 30 minutes. The English translation is very\nwell prepared.\n\"Kuro Hime\" (Nippon Hoso Kyokai, Japan)\nConforming with the tradition of Japanese culture this programme presents\na legend of high ethical value with remarkable force and artistic precision.\nThe tremendous expressiveness of the puppets, the. lyrical tenderness, the\ndramatic fights, the brilliant colours and the masterly exploitation of all\ntechnical facilities make this programme a most impressive achievement\nand an outstanding work of art.\nNOTES\nIt was difficult to separate \"Kuro Hime\" and the U.S.S.R. programme,\n\"The Young Bullfighters\". They were of equal standard: though\nvery different. This programme, presenting puppets in colour,\nwas remarkable. I have never seen puppets so lifelike. A 'must*"
