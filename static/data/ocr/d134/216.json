Keogh and\nRobert Hinkel)in \"Auto-Neuroticism”\nOur highway system is the most efficient slaughter-house our nation\nhas ever had.\nThe car was first touted as:\nThe end to horse-pollution\nA way to get away from the city, for a spin in the country to get\n•t\nfresh air.\nThe car made possible a whole new system of courting -- back seat, no\npeeping parents.\nRoaring twenties:\nThe 30*s were simply the debris of the fast-paced decade. Hence\nthe depression was as much a psychological as an economic phenomaon.\nCar vocabulary:\ncrack-up, nervous wreck, breakdoen, traffic jams, jay-walker,\n\"crash\" programs.\n(now, \"TV” meals, furniture, values, art forms, soap operas, etc.)\nF. Scott Fitzgerald once sadi^ rather flippantly, that the crasn (the\n■\ndepression) was made inevitable by the Empire State Building.\nIt made it possible for man to climb up and look and see limits to our\nnation - which we previosuly thought had no real limits: to land,\no^jiir, or water.\nWar economy:\nThe pistons of steam engines and autos were the children of the\ndrilling of cannon bores (barrels). In the 17th century a French\nman proposed an engine to be driven by the force of gunpowder exploding\nin metal cylinders. We later found gasoline more practical."
