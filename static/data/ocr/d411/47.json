Cheydleur\nAssistant Director\nRadio Station WFSU\nFlorida State University\nTallahassee, Florida\nDear Ray;\nHave been going through the research files and corres¬\npondence this weekend. This is a gloomy Sunday afternoon\nin Iowa — probably too depressing a day to be writing drafts\nof letters — but my only chance to catch tip on this sort\nof thing.\n1 found a number of references to your bringing your\nsummary of theses on radio-television up-to-date. Wonderful\nidea. Was this done? If not, is it still in the works some¬\nplace? X also found references to the fact that a research\nmanual (I gather the same idea that X suggested in Chicago and\nfor which X have started a part on coincidentals) was being\nworked on as far back as 1954. What ever happened to this?\nDo we have any parts of it? Xf so, we could utilize them in\nour new manual. Xf it was done, we can simply save that time\nit would take to do it again.\nX have asked Paulu to request funds for a committee\nmeeting, following the completion of our Columbus report,\nfor the final drafting of our research proposals for presen¬\ntation to a foundation. X thought that the same amount of\nmoney which was available for our Chicago meeting would be\nadequate for this purpose. X think we will need to do most\nof this work by correspondence and each individual getting as\nmany of his ideas on paper beforehand as possible, but a meeting\nwill be needed to try to hammer out some final consensus.\nOn the implementation report from Gale, X do not think\nwe need to send corrections to Keith at this point. He, as\nX understand it, will send everyone a copy of everything for\ncorrections as soon as he has it all pulled together. X do"
