  "text": "POLY-ANTICS OP THE HIGHWAY\nA road is at first in Low Definition, coming into existÂ¬\nence to fetch rural produce to town areas--(before road, of\ncourse, the pedestrian and the mounted man).\nAs it goes into High Definition, it fetches the town\nto the country.\nIt next becomes a substitute for the country, and then\ndestroys the country.\nAs it continues to improve, or be more of a road, it\ndestroys the city, and is at that stage metamorphosed into\na new kind of city.\nThe current town planners talk of cities 3000 miles\nlong, and of hundreds of millions of people.\nI have omitted the vehicle component in this dynamic,\nbut obviously a road consists of two media simultaneously,\nwith constant interaction between them.\nSo, as a highway becomes a city, it also becomes\nan airway. And the airway is for travel, and the highway\nfor living. '\nA similar sort of reversal occurs in the vehicle\nitself which gives the experience of travel up to a certain\nspeed, and then there is the reversal into stasis. So that\nin jet travel there is hardly any experience of movement at\nall, and whether you are over Rome, or Tokyo, the experience\nis the same.\nMarshall ffcLuhan\nMarch 8th, i960."
