Because a good\nmany of the \"experts\" in this field are also applicants themselves, or\nclosely associated with applicants - it was no easy task to nominate\nqualified persons who would not be susceptible to conflict of interest\nconsiderations. In our group, we will have none who will have a conflict\nof interest problem with respect to any individual application. We will\nhave good cross sectional representation, from every section of the\ncountry - and we will have working with us people whose backgrounds include\nan intimate working knowledge of station operation as well as the range\nof instructional, educational and public broadcasting.\nI've taken a little time and gone into some detail on the appointment\nof consultants, because this is a topic NOT covered in the materials\nhanded to you. The other steps we've already taken to seek, the assistance\nwe will need are covered in those materials.\n(b) For example, in the Program Bulletin, on pages 2 and 3, we have\nindicated the status of pending applications and the necessity for each\napplicant to review and reconsider his application in the light of the\nfiscal facts for 1969. In addition, we have written each applicant\ndirectly, alerting him to the need for such review, and suggesting three\npossible courses of action an applicant may take with respect to an\napplication which is pending."
