However, such fare\ntends to be scheduled In times of crises when national attention is so focused\nas to make public affairs coverage profitable or is in response to critical scrutiny\nfrom the FCC.\nCrisis coverage, however, is not sufficiently consistent to make for an\ninformed public judgment.\nIn the Soviet world audience instruction is a matter of national policy;\nin the United States audience instruction is in irresponsibility as an incidental\naspect of marketing.
