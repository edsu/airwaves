  "text": "We should not forget that the peace, social\nprogress, national and human dignity which the\nfree nations of Asia seek with renewed vigor are\nprecisely the things for which the United States\nhas long stood. As an American organization,\ntherefore, The Asia Foundation believes in the\nright of the peoples of Asia to fashion their\nown destinies free of foreign domination or\nsubversion.\nX HE problems of Asia spring from a meeting\nof the old and new, from the need to reconcile\nthe truth of the East with the truth of the West.\nThey are problems of adjustment and adapta¬\ntion, problems which are not confined to eradi¬\ncating poverty and disease, but involve the mind\nand the spirit as well. Similarly, we should not\nthink only in terms of providing material aid\nand technical skills. Necessary as these are, as¬\nsistance in terms of increased human under¬\nstanding and moral encouragement is often\nmore important.\nThe Foundation thus offers to help those\ngroups and individuals who are promoting the\nmanifold aspects—spiritual, civic, economic,\nartistic, social and educational—of the Asian\nrenaissance. Its aid is private. It seeks to en¬\ncourage voluntary activity, believing that ac¬\ntion by individuals working as private citizens\nis a fundamental requisite of democratic socie¬\nties.\nIts programs are developed in response to the\nneeds of the countries of Asia based on requests\nmade to the Foundation’s representatives in\nthese countries.\nEducation, for example, being a principal\nconcern of these countries, the Foundation co¬\noperates with educational institutions in fur¬\nthering their functions as centers of learning\nand in the development of these institutions to\nmeet more fully the needs of the entire com¬\nmunity."
