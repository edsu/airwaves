Harley\nDate: December 2, 1958\nRe: Region III Convention Site\nFirst, thanks to all of you for going to the trouble of\nlooking up data and availabilities with reference to\nholding the convention in your area*\nAfter consultation with several Region Hirers, I have\nchoosen the Kellogg Center in East Lansing as the location\nfor our meeting* The decision was based upon such consider¬\nations as relative accessibility by car, physical facilities\navailability of a member station(s) for visiting, etc.\nThe dates for the meeting have been set for Feb. 19-20.\nThis is a bit later in the year than the time decided upon\nby the group at Omaha, but I felt it advisable to allow\nmore time for prior planning — particularly for the\nengineers— and also to allow ray successor as Region III\ndirector to get into the act before all is set and frozen.\nMore details shortly."
