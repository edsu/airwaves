  "text": "support as it demonstrates its contributions to instructional, research,\nand public service functions, “Whereas a few years ago AV service was often\nexpected to aim toward a self-supporting status, colleges today are includ¬\ning subsidies for campus AV services as a recognized part of the college\nbudget.\nIn Conclusion\nThe consultants preparing this brochure are well aware of the fact that\nno audio-visual service develops overnight from the idea stage to a complete\nservice, capable of meeting all campus needs. Small beginnings, if along\nwise lines, can develop into adequate service programs.\nThis brochure describes the services, organization, staff, space, and\nfacilities for an adequate college or university program. A picture of such\naudio-visual service will be of value to programs now in existence, as well\nas to beginning programs. Altho needs, and therefore the AV service, vary\ngreatly from campus to campus, much effort, time, and money can be saved by\nlooking and planning ahead and by profiting from the experiences of others.\nThose concerned with planning of campus AV service centers should be\ncognizant of the fact that the demand for service grows at an exceedingly\nrapid rate. Most campuses tend to underestimate their eventual space needs.\nIt is well to develop a flexible organization with space and facilities\ncapable of growing in any or all directions."
