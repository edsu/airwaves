  "text": "This, then, Allen, seems the gist of the REGION VI Meeting and my com¬\nments on it* It certainly is not a report and it may not even be a review\nin the strict sense of the word* Perhaps I have just taken it as a stump\nfrom which to express some of my own opinions. However, I believe they are\nthe basic problems confronting the NAEB today and they will require all the\nenlightenment possible before they can be solved. I hope the readers of this\nwill take what I have said and consider the source just as I took a good many\nof the things that were said in the meeting and considered the source of them.\nOne thing I haven* t done is follow through with the television discussion\nwhich I am sure was interesting, but which, by the very nature of the brute\nis changing so rapidly that what was said is undoubtedly considerably out-\nof-date now. Then, too, there is the possibility that some of the things\nthat were said should not be repeated now because of those subsequent devel¬\nopments.\nAgain, I am sorry I could not get to this meeting. I know now that it\nwas a good one and I would have liked to have sat in on the discussions.\nYou know, of course, that REGION IV has held a meeting since yours, so now\nif we get REGION I to hold theirs, in the very near future, we will have made\na complete round robin. When we tie this up with the combined Workshop-Con¬\nvention, forthcoming in Chicago next Fall, I believe that we will have rounded\nout five years of development, growth and expansion with the wonderful help\nof the Kellogg Foundation in an advisory and financial capacity, and the tre¬\nmendous work on the part of the members, both those who have served on the\nBoard and in officer capacity, and those who have not. In retrospect, it is\nall pretty wonderful."
