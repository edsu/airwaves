  "text": "«5~\nTherefore, it was the consensus of the Board that the several\ngroups and Interests Involved in educational broadcasting should\nre-evaluate their functions and performance in the context of\nthe nation’s present educational needs. This process might\nInvolve not only the leaders of education and educational\nbroadcasting* but advisors from other fields'as well.\nWhat might be the eventual outcome of such a group self¬\nappraisal? This no one can foresee. It might bring about new\ndefinitions of goals and objectives. It might lead to basic\nchanges* both within and among these organizations. It would not\nnecessarily enhance the role of the NASB: our purpose in\nadvocating such a self-appraisal is to advance the cause of\neducational broadcasting* not merely to change the status of any\none organization. As the preamble to our constitution declares:\n\"Believing that radio and television broadcasting are most\nimportant factors and influences in the national and international\nwelfare* we*the representatives of educational, cultural and\npublic service institutions, organizations, agencies and\nassociations engaged in educational and cultural broadcasting* do\nassociate ourselves to promote, by united effort and mutual\ncooperation* the dissemination of knowledge* information* and\neducation to the end that the educational* cultural and technical\nbenefits of broadcasting may be extended to all.\"\nSuch objectives, it seems to me* constitute a good guide for\nNAEB and all others in educational broadcasting, as we enter what\nwe hope will be\nA HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
