With its arrival now seemingly only a matter of days away,\nwe are making many plans not only to adequately use this piece of\nequipment but to change the operation of the network so that it can\nmore speedily and more surely distribute the many fine programs which\nare available to it.

These\nplans are again well under way. One new rrBiriber will be added to\nour staff in June and another perhaps in the fall as the details of\nthe operation are developed.

The\nengineering group is still working on tape reproduction standards\nand is making progress toward the ultimate goal of top quality\nmasters, top quality duplicates, and top quality reproduction by"
