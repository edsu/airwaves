Box 2002\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Mr. Ausmus:\nYour inquiry concerning Mr. Gale Adkins arrived\nseveral days ago, but this is my first opportunity\nto reply. It is a fine compliment to Mr. Adkins\nthat you are considering him for the important\nposition of Executive Director of the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters. However,\nI am confident that it would handicap our program\nhere rather seriously if he should leave prior to\nthe end of the current long session, as he is\npresently serving as Acting Director of Radio House.\nMr. Adkins has been connected with Radio House for\na period of at least eight years, and in my judgment\nhe has rendered excellent service. However, I have\nnot been associated closely enough with our radio\nwork to enable me to give you an accurate appraisal\nof his technical competence. Accordingly, I am\nreferring your letter to Professor T. A. Rousse,\nChairman of our Radio Committee, with the request\nthat he give you his professional appraisal of Mr.\nAdkinâ€™s abilities. I am confident that you will\nhear from Professor Rousse within the near future.\nWith best personal wishes, I am\nSincerely yours.\nJCD:bg\nJames C. Dolley\nActing President\nMain University\ncc: Professor T. A. Rousse"
