  "text": "-63-\nresolution, there are two reliable ways of\nachieving this:\n1) Early in the life of the TVA, the REA\ncreated an \"emergency conference call\nsystem.\" By using the power lines\nwhich this agency erected for these\nrural communities, they established a\ntelephonic \"net\" which linked together\nall of the TVA personnel working in\nthat region. What we suggest is the\nrevival and broadening of that facility.\nIt provides for a telephone instrument\nto be placed in each home in a given area.\nThose telephones are tied into a two-way\nsystem which, when activated, makes im¬\nmediate contact with a pre-set group of\nsupport facilities in the nearest com¬\nmunity. For example: Welfare, Medical,\nPolice, and any other critical service in\nany given area. These messages are carried\nover existing REA power lines and is rela¬\ntively inexpensive to install, operate and\nmaintain."
