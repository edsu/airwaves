That is not to say that there is no risk.\nIn this context I should like to quote the words of the American\nphysicists and member of the Atomic Energy Commission, Professor\nDr. Libby. ”The risk of radioactive poisoning must be balanced against\nthe risk to which the entire free world be exposed if nuclear tests\nwere abandoned before a safe international disarmament •. agreement\nhas been brought about* The tests are necessary if the United States\nof America are not to be left behind in the developement of nuclear\nweapons”-^"
