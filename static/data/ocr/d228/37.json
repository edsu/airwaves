In\nevery state and in every locality there are asple safeguards against\nsuch a thing happening. There is the F. C. 0. which passes v®on the\n^ualifieatiojss and responsibilities of the licensee. The State Agency\nfor Educational Television assumes farther prerogatives of control; and\nthe Commissioner of Education and Board of Control for Higher Educa¬\ntion exercise direct responsibilities. The *educational\" provision\nof the local non-profit charters, and the predominant participation\nof public schools in the cosaaunlty station davelopaent are further\nsafeguards against proper use of educational television facilities*\nWe believe that the purposes of the ^gnuson-Bc^>ezts bills\ncan best be accon^liched by making the funds available as origimlly\nproposed and in as single and direct a way possible, consonant with\nthe ainisRffii Federal restrictions incorporated in the bills.\naiank you, again, for your interest and great help in\nmsMi^g Federal assistance possible in the development of television\nas a great national resource for education.\nSincerely yours.\nWilliam 0.
