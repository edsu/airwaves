Â«\nActually, this matter goes back to a decision taken by the HAEB\nboard before either of us were elected. At a meeting of the Board in\nDecember, 1957, President Paulu was directed to change the chairman\nof the ^International Relations Committee, due to the ambiguity of his\ndual position in representing HAEB and BFA. I mention this only to\nindicate that this is not a matter involving a sudden or capricious\ndecision, but has had long-time consideration. The Executive Cemnittee,\nreexamined the issues involved, weighed the consequences, and decided\nunanimously on this course.\nI fully agree with you that \"Si is one of the most dynamic and\neffective men in our craft and this we need too.\" He should very\nmuch like to cooperate with BFA and avail ourselves of Si's abilities\nwhenever such assistance is clearly beneficial for HAEB. In the past\nthis distinction has been rather difficult to make.\nSince the appointment of committee personnel is the president's\nperogative and the matter was not really a local or district matter I\ndid not confer with you in advance of taking action. However, I'll\nbe glad to give you more details when we have a chance to talk and\nwill review this matter for the full Board at Columbus.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley"
