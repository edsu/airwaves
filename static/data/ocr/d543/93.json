HARLEY\nDATE: June 3Q, 1959\nYou have all received copies of say letter to Arthur\nAdams and John Sehwarzwalder*s reaction to it in which he\nindicated that my statement of HAE3!s position was far too\nmild and that wo should either decide to support Continental\nClassroom, Inc. as something worthwhile or, if we decided it\nwas a bad thing, use every means at our command to forthrightly\nopposing the new agency. He felt this was a matter of such\npressing importance that it merited, an emergency meeting of\nthe NA'STB Board.\nHe still feels this way about the matter but is willing\n?he decisi°n as to whether such a meeting be called to a\nmail ballot. His view is that (1) obviously no other group is\ndisposed to actively oppose Continental Classroom, Inc. and/\nHence, {2} NAKB has the opportunity and Responsibility to seise\nnational leadership in organising the opposition and leading the\nfight against a serious threat to BTV* b\nI have previously indicated my position in the letter\nto Adams ana in the covering memo which accompanied it. On the\n°JS5;S reactions volunteered by Board members and the discussion\n?SJ???^2‘nentaI Classroom,Inc. by ETV station managers (Center\nA«xx_iao0s meeting, St. Louis, June 2S**26), I do not feel such\na meeting is warranted. However, if five members of the Board\n(as provided in the Constitution) agree that such a meeting is\ndesirable, it will be called. Moreover, if there is indication\noi a substantial disagreement with my handling of the matter or\nthat ny letter did not accurately state NAFB* s position re Cont¬\ninence a j. Classroom, Inc., I am ready to reassess the situation\nand take whatever a ctlon is deemed appropriate.\nW. Cr. Harley, Hadio Hall, Madison 6, Wisconsin\n1.\nDo you favor calling a special meeting of the NA^B Board\noo discuss Continental Classroom, Inc.? VIS |~~g HO"
