The University\nof Chicago has made its roundtable program available to the tape network\nand has generously supplied enough tapes to enable all the stations to\nbroadcast a given program within a tiro week period.\nThe quality of programs of the network has been reasonably good, certainly\nbetter than one would normally expect in an operation where nearly every\nprogram that has been offered has been accepted. Nevertheless, the\nbicycle network has two great needs* (1) adequate facilities and staff\nfor the simultaneous reproduction of tape transcriptions and professional\nmanagement of the operation, and (2) the bringing of the best minds and\ncommunications skills in America to bear car program content and program\npresentation."
