Hill\nDATE: October 7, 1959\nDr* Anna Hyer, Executive Secretary, Department of Audio-Visual Instruction,\nNational Education Association, has been exploring with the United States\nOffice of Education the possibility of the Office including certain questions\nabout utilization of A-V materials in its biennial survey of the status of\neducation* She has kindly offered to submit questions about radio and\ntelevision if we can supply them.\nOf course, she is not certain that the USCE will be able to undertake the\naddition of questions in our fields, nor that they would accept any or all\nof the questions we might propose. However, this seems like an excellent\nopportunity to at least try to get soire information about uses of radio and\ntelevision in education in the nation* s schools.\nTherefore, will you please send me, as soon as convenient, a list of perÂ¬\ntinent questions, the answers to which you believe would be helpful to the\nNAEB and the entire educational broadcasting movement? The time on this\nis short, so I would appreciate anything you can do soon. Thanks.\nHEH: JO"
