Strongest opponent of the no¬\neditorial policy was Radio Attorney\nW. Theodore Pierson, who insisted\nthat a broadcaster “fulfills his duty\nif full and equal opportunity is af¬\nforded to all substantial sides of\nI broadcast issues.”\nPierson was on hand to repr\nKOB.

Va.; and\nWHj’to?d1thhe0 Commission his clients\nhave reached the following conclu¬\nsions;\n1. That Congressional action in the field\nof radio transmissions cannot be constitu¬\ntionally justified or authorized unless, (A)\n1 Government censorship is prohibited except\nfor utterances illegal as a matter of general\n'law; and,, unless, (B) a public duty is im¬\nposed upon the licensee of a facility.\n2. The licensee as a matter of law cannot\nexclude substantial views of public issues\nthat he decides to broadcast irrespective of\nwhether such views are contrary to or in\naccord with his own.\n3. The licensees’ duty not to exclude is\nneither made greater nor smaller by the\npresentation of the licensees’ views.\n4. The licensee fulfills his public duty\nwith respect to public issues that are broad¬\ncast if full and equal opportunity is afforded\nto all substantial sides.\n5. The full-and-equal opportunity princi¬\nple should be a duty not to exclude sub-\n! stantial sides rather than the impracticable\nduty to include all substantial sides.\n6. The expression of editorial opinions of\nbroadcast station licensees on matters of\npublic interest and controversy is consistent\nwith their public duty and a denial by the\nCommission of such a right is violative of\nSection 326 of the statute and the First\nAmendment of the Constitution.\n7. The Commission has the power upon\nreviewing the programs of the licensee to\ndetermine whether unlawful programs have\nbeen broadcast and to act in accordance\nwith such finding.\n8. While the Commission has the power\nto employ program examination in a lim¬\nited manner to judge an applicant’s qualifica¬\ntions, it does not have the power under the\nstatute or the Constitution to decide or de¬\nclare whether any lawful program or lawful\ntype of program is in the public interest.\n‘ Lawyer Morris Ernst of New YorK~\ntold the Commission that the ban\nshould stand except in those areas\nwhere there is true diversity of own¬\nership among stations. He said he\ndefinitely 4,would not allow an absen-\n! tee owner to editorialize.”\nCoy Suggests \"More Vitality\"\nFCC Chairman Wayne Coy. suggest¬\ned that “more vitality” might result\nin towns with but one newspaper\nand one radio station, not jointly\nowned—if the broadcaster were per¬\nmitted to editorialize in opposition to\nthe newspaper. That, said Ernst, is\nanybody’s guess. Commissioner Clif¬\nford J. Durr remarked that an enter¬\nprising broadcaster in such a situation\ncan see to it that public issues are\ndebated over his facilities.\nSaul Carson, radio editor of the\nNew Republic, told the FCC that “the\nvery attack against the Mayflower de¬\ncision is based upon one proposition\n— destruction of every regulatory\npower vested in the FCC. Wipe out\nthe Mayflower decision and you per¬\nform an act harmful not only to the\nmillions of owners of radio receiving\nsets but also to the thousands of own¬\ners of radio transmitters.”\nMilton Stewart, for the American\nJewish Congress, called upon the FCC\nto “go further than the ban on edi¬\ntorializing . . . the Commission should\nrip wide open the whole question of\nequal time for both sides on contro¬\nversial issues.”\nRep. Emanuel Celler of New York\ntold the Commission he was “one\ntook a like position. a‘9t*91 9V1999t\nPierson ran into’ length question¬\ning by the Commission—with Com¬\nmissioner Webster especially upset\nwhen Pierson suggested the FCC\nreach decisions on the flip of a coin.\nThe suggestion came in answer to a\nquestion by Commissioner Durr, who\nasked what the Commission should\ndo, according to Pierson’s views, if\ntwo applicants for a station seemed\nequal in their qualifications and one\nproposed a straight network program\nschedule and the other balanced\nschedule including local program¬\nming.\n“That’s not the Commission’s busi¬\nness,” Pierson said.\nWhen Webster asked if “court\nwould uphold a ruling made on the\nflip of a coin,” Pierson said he would\nbe “glad to supply the coin for future\ndecisions. It might be a good way to\nclear off the docket.”\nHe admitted in response to ques¬\ntioning by Commissioner Sterling,\nhowever, that the Commission was\nwithin its rights when it moved\nagainst lotteries on the air.\nScheduled to be heard today are\nthe CIO, Morris Novik and Erik Bar-\nnow of the Radio Writers Guild."
