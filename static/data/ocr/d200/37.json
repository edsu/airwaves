Leonard Press\nWBKY(FM)\nUniversity of Kentucky\nLexington, Kentucky\nDear Len:\nHave just talked with John Bystrom and he indicates\nthat the situation is about as we expected; namely, no\nmoney, no action.\nHEW had its hearing before the Subcommittee on\nAppropriations but has not yet got a report on how they\nmade out. They still have to go to the Senate Appro¬\npriations Committee after that.\nUntil they have an appropriation, Bystrom & Company\nare unable to hire any new staff. The people they have\ngot so far have been transferred from some other part of\nthe government payroll. He said that he had considered\nputting you on as a consultant, but recognized that you\nobviously would have to have a more permanent assurance\nthan that before you pulled out of your present sinecure.\nHe fully understands your difficulty in trying to\nkeep things in a fluid state but hopes you will also appre¬\nciate his difficulties in not being able to move any\nfaster in this situation.\nI will await a communique from you relative to\nscheduling the conference you phoned about.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:pw"
