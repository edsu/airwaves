Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Mr. Harley:\nMr. John L. Burns, President of RCA, informed me in his letter\nof May 10 (of which he sent you a copy) that he had also sent to you\nanother letter of mine suggesting a \"broad-guage committee\" to consider\nMr. Burns' recent proposal for an all-out educational TV effort.\nI am writing you to emphasize my own eagerness to be of help\nin any way in getting such a program underway. While Manager of the\nPublic Information Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nuntil 1960, I participated as a producer and planner in educational TV\nover Channel 11, WPIX. I am widely acquainted in banking and financial\ncircles in New York City. I believe that I could be of value to any\ncommittee attempting to enlist public support for the program and want\nto offer my services to you for whatever they may be worth.\nIn this connection, you are aware that Lehigh University has no\neducational TV facilities. I am, frankly, concerned about this situation\nand am hoping that, through cooperative local effort now being organized,\nit will be possible to move aggressively to gain facilities here. I am\nsure that you could give me and Lehigh helpful suggestions and assis¬\ntance in this matter, as I believe that I could give you helpful assis¬\ntance in generating important support for a much broader national effort\nin the educational TV area."
