Accordingly, we are extending\ninvitations to the newly elected officers and the five\nmembers of the Committee to meet with us at the Blackstone\nHotel in Chicago at 2:00 in the afternoon of Thursday,\nDecember k» We will act as hosts for this meeting and will\nbe happy to cover the travel and living expenses of all\nparticipants. It will probably be best, however, if you\nhandle your own hotel reservation direct.\nWe feel that considerable importance attaches to this\nmeeting and are most hopeful that all those mentioned above\ncan be present. We will appreciate your confirming your\nown plans for the meeting by collect wire. If we are\nunable to advise you in advance as to the exact room at the\nBlackstone which will be used for the conference, this informa¬\ntion will be available at the desk. The room will be in\nMr. Fletcher's name."
