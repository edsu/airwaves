In the United States,\nto which he soon returned, the Constitution had just been adopted.\nJefferson's instructions about his tombstone were drawn by him toward the end\nof his life (see illustration in The Jeffersonian Heritage).\nJefferson did have lodgings at the home of Jacob Graff in Philadelphia, al¬\nthough the precise circumstances of his taking them over are not known. His\nconversation with Mrs. Graff is true in that it shows the sort of man he was, and\nit sets forth in this incidental fashion some of his most characteristic ideas.\nThe motto, \"Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God\", enters more directly into\nthe next program. Another that is repeated in later programs - and almost every¬\nwhere else that Jefferson is talked about - is deservedly famous and supremely\ncharacteristic: \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against\nevery form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" We are getting ahead of the story by\nhaving him say this in 1776, for he said it in a letter to Benjamin Rush in 1800.\nHowever, he had precisely the same attitude at the earlier date.\nThe conversations between Jefferson and Dickinson, Livingston, and others are\nimaginary, but they summarize many of the arguments for and against independence,\nin Congress and among the delegates. Dickinson was probably the most conspicuous\ncongressional opponent of independence at this precise time, though he afterwards\ndid military service for the Continental cause.\nExperimental Discussion Program\nSubject to Revision\n15"
