It certainly will beer further inwstiga-\ntion«\nTHE MASS DUPLICATOR PRQBLBXI~*AHQng th© things I had thouglrb would take a few minutes\nto do in Washington was to visit Georgettsm University and see their msc duplicator\nin action* My first shook ms that it w&sn’t &t Georgetown but ms uith an engineer\nby tii© mm® of Ra*rd©a Smith, vdw ms setting up to make -taps duplicates on a con~\nmercial basis® My visit with Smith took something less than k hours during which\nI got a terrific sales talk on the value of the machine and some indication that\nhe, not Toogood, ms the man who would ©^mutually be able to supply us a roaohiae-\nbut no further indication ae to when sue!?, a machine might b© available®\nI then visited Dr. Dorstair, Head of the Linguistic Institute of Georgetown\nUniversity® This is an amassing institution which teaches 26 different languages\nand can make almost anyone a conversationalist in any of these languages within an\namazingly short time*\nTo do this they use some 100 brush soundn&rror tape recorders. They have\n16 of them set up so that they can put a master on any one and dub on the other 15.\nThe system works but the quality leaves much to be desired. Dorstair was very\ninsistent upon his need for a mass duplicator and was more than willing to go along\nwith us to get one developed. I plan to pursue this whole area much further in\nthe immediate future and will have a more complete report for you*"
