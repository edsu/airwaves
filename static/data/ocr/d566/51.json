Ideas far Television Programs\nMuch emphasis has been placed upon the obtaining of licenses and\nallocationso When can we start planning outstanding programs?\nWCAL\nMilford Jensen\nlo Could NAEB provide some type of program evaluation service? As we\nsee it, stations tend to become ingrown. Upper management remains soraewhat static\n(I have been at WCAL for 2£ years). Maybe the local station*s approach to a\nprogramming problem is right; maybe it isn*t. As for example, every station has\ncertain local conditions which it must satisfyo Each station has an institution\nbehind it which has certain aims and objectives. Does the station aid in reaching\nthese aims and objectives?

How can regional meetings be instituted? How frequent\nshould regional meetings be held? Are the regions of the NAEB geographically con¬\nducive to regional meetings? Someone ought to study this.\nX -5RB*\nWVSH\nM. McCabe Day\nWhat opportunities might the NAEB tape network open if universities\ndeveloped a real ’’classroom of the airf* type of program, in which listeners might\nenroll, and possibly follow a course outline, with an examination and even materials\nsent in for some sort of credit recognition? This may be a brainstorm, but it\nseems to me that there are possibilities in this concept of adult education. For"
