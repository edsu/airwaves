If you, as chairman, are unable to attend the\nconvention, perhaps you could designate another member on your committee to present a report,\nftr>d so inform said committee member.\nIf you care to present a report, we would appreciate your holding it to not oore than 10\nminutes. We would appreciate, too, your preparing your report in written form so that we\nmay have it for the complete record of the convention and for the official fries of the\nAssociation. This written report night well be only a page or two, and ycu could then use\nthis as a basis for expanded oral remarks.\nIf you would care to have your report duplicated for distribution at the convention, this\nwould be fine, and I would estimate that about 200-250 copies should be run off. While it is\nhoped that chairmen desiring to distribute their reports can have them duplicated and bring\nthem to the convention, we will try to duplicate for you any reports sent in by October 9*\nIf you follow the latter procedure, perhaps you can prepare the report on ditto master and\nsend it to us in that form so that all we have to do is run it off.\nFor all reports to be duplicated, may I suggest the format indicated below? Such uniformity\nwill give a better appearance to the reports >\nCommittee reports will be started at the first business session which will be h .‘Id Monday\nafternoon, October 23 * Those not presented at the time will be presented at the final business\nsession on Thursday morning, October 26.\nmi you please let me know by October k the answers to the following:\n1- Do you plan to present a report?\n2- Approximately how long will it be?\n3- Wild, it be duplicated by you for distribution?\n4- TO l you want us to duplicate it for distribution?\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\nReport of the xxxxxxxxacagocx Committee\nPresented at the MEB 37th Annual Convention\nOctober 23 - 26, 1961, Washington, ih C\nrnlm\n9/25/61"
