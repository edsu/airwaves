In addition, the University should have a first\nquality research center; a workshop, conference and convention center; a\nspecial training center for government personnel; consultant services to all\npotential users in all areas, including such things as systems planning; a\nproduced^ center for all communications needs; a special center for innovative\nexperiment and application; and, perhaps most important of all, the highest\nquality inter-disciplinary undergraduate and graduate degree and non-degree\nprograms.\nI believe that one of the most significant educational investments we can\nmake today is to establish a Communications University maintaining the highest\nacademic standards and services, not only for transmitting ideas, but for\nrelating people with people, and for reaching people with both content and\nnon-content motivation.\nI believe such a University could have great positive value in meeting\nthe immediate and ultimate needs of urban America as well as the needs of\nother geographical and sociological areas of the world.\nOne highly relevant point in terms of our particular discussion here today:\nsuch a University should be--would have, to be--developed through the cooperative\nefforts of government, education, industry, and foundationst\nI shall not take time here to discuss other efforts in the area of\ncommunications and formal education. What is important is our individual\ncommitment to an active role in supporting one or more of these efforts if we\nbelieve that communications and education are indeed remedies for the urban crisis."
