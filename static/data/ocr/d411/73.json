At present, we're working along two lines: (1)\nidentifying the person or group to undertake the compilation of the pro¬\nposed inventory; and, (2) exploring the possibility of making the project\na joint venture of NAEB, ETRC, and NPAC*\nOn the first point, Ken Harwood and his people have responded with\nwhat looks like a workable plan and are in the process of drawing up a\nformal proposal. No final decision has been made, but we're checking\nwith all of the people who offered comments and suggestions in reply to\nmy first \"round robin\" letter. On the second point, NAEB has agreed to\ncome in on a one-third-share basis, and I hope that ETRC will make a\nsimilar decision.\nThat's where things stand at present. I'll keep in touch as the\nproject develops and would appreciate having any thoughts or reactions\nthat might occur to you.\nSincerely yours.\nJMP: ts\nEnclosure"
