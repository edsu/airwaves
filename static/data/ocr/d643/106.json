Burton Paulu\nKVOM\n1 Eddy Hal 1\nMinneapolis 14, Minnesota\nDear Burton:\nIn haste, and in brief, because i leave for Madison\nwithin the hour.\nI had read the Schwarzwalder and Vogl letters.\nI think you wrote a good reply, too.\nRegarding circuiarizing all ETV stations, I think\n1 would play this by ear. If you are sure that some station\ngot such a letter, then fill in that particular station. For\nexample, Schwarzwalder did not send me copy. Maybe he sent\nRider a copy, but it has not been mentioned to me by Rider.\nI do think it important to follow up in places\nwhere you are sure John fired the ammunition.\ni* 11 take dope with me and talk with McCarty and\nHarley in Madison this afternoon.\nRegards,\nFrank E.
