Kenneth Harwood, Chairman\nDepartment of Telecomaunicatioos\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, California\nDear Ken:\nThank you very much for your letter and report. You\ndid an excellent job and 1 think that the recommendation is\na good one.\n1 assume that Harry will inform the recipients of\nthe grants of the fact that they are recipients and it seems\nto me perfectly in order that he urge Koger to take extreme\ncare in identifying opinion leaders and to consider care¬\nfully the possibility of obtaining his information through\npersonal interviews. (Harry, these suggestions were noted\nby Ken, ifamata, and Merrill and I certainly concur. If\nfollowed, these would strengthen his study tremendously and\nit seems to me clearly proper for the KAEB to make these sug¬\ngestions.)\nBy the way, Ken, John Parsey has informed me that you\nmight be doing the inventory-digest of radio research. I hope\nyou do. I assume that he will pass on the few comments that\nX had. The major me was that X would hope that you would do\nan evaluation as well as a summary and place some emphasis\non methodology as well as findings. (I am sure that you had\nthese things in mind anyway.)\nThank you again for your letter and your good work on\nthe grante-in-aid project.\nSincerely,\nSam L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLB;mw\ncc: Dr. Barry Skornia"
