KESSLER\nDecember 15, 1954\nDr. Harry J. Skornia\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dr. Skornia\nI am enclosing herewith the Stamped file copy of NAEB’s Reply\nComments in connection with the Commission's inter-city rule-\nmaking proceeding. There are also enclosed five additional copies\nfor your files.\nAfter considering your suggestion that we follow the JCET's Com¬\nments, I too agreed with its desirability. Thus, as you will\nnote, NAEB's Comments, in substance, merely reaffirm and support\nthe position taken by the JCET except that our Comments include\nverbatim copy of the Wisconsin State Radio Council’s letter to the\nCommission.\nUpon checking the Commission’s files, I ascertained that the\nWisconsin State letter was not a part of the official docket, and\nsince it so vividly presents the adverse effects upon educational\ntelevision of the Commission’s present Rule, I believed it desirable\nto quote the letter in full in our Comments.\nWhen you first wrote to Leonard concerning the preparation of our\nComments you enclosed your recent file of correspondence with the\nWisconsin State Radio Council and asked that it be returned to\nyou. This data is enclosed herewith.\nSincerely\nSylvj\nEnclosures"
