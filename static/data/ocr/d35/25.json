The interviews were then integrated into\none program with Arab and Israel answers to each\nquestion spliced back to back. This reminds us\nof a similar program in which WFBE interviewed\nthe two candidates for governor separately givi\ning them each the same five questions. They\nwere then spliced back to back and students\nwere given the opportunity to hear the two\ncandidates answer the same question.
