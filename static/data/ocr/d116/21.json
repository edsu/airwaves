This has been the most incredible\nmadhouse you can imagine getting a television operation\non the air and at the same time running our PM and AM.\nAlmost all of the headaches which people predict for\ntelevision operation come true, plus a few that they\nfailed to note. However, it is a very challenging\nproposition and a lot of fun. There has been considerable\nillness in our family for the past eight months and that\ntoo has complicated matters at this end. I hope the last\nhalf of the year will find me more communicative than\nheretofore.\nIt was good to hear from you.\nRichard B. Hull\nPresident\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES RBH l JH\nDALLAS W.
