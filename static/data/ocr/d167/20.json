I have asked him to appoint whatever Conference\ncommittees that he and our Virginia hosts deem necessary for plan¬\nning, promoting, and programming and conducting the Conference.\nIn addition to my geographical remoteness from the intri¬\nguing site of the Conference, my personal plans are so uncertain\nthat I could be of only limited help to our good Virginia hosts --\nwho, by the way, are arranging unusual events which will be ex¬\ntremely attractive to Region II members, colleagues and families.\nWhile I plan to submit to the Williamsburg Conference\ncertain recommendations relating to Region II organizational\nstructure, it is necessary now that a SITE SELECTION COMMITTEE\nfor the 1966 Conference begin considering -- or seeking, if\nnecessary -- invitations for the site of the 1966 Conference.\nI earnestly hope that the following will accept appointment to\nthis SITE SELECTION COMMITTEE:\nName\nHr7~Howard Holst, CHAIRMAN\nMr. L. 0. Press, VICE-CHAIRMAN\nMr. Duff Browne\nMiss Dona Lee Davenport\nMr. James Petersen\nAddress\nTOTTV, Memphis, Tennessee\n2580 Millbrook Drive\nLexington, Kentucky\n130 Sixth Street, N. W.\nAtlanta, Georgia\n1510 Exeter Road\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFlorida Atlantic University\nBoca Raton, Florida\nWe will look forward to a specific recommendation from\nthem for Region II members to vote on at the Williamsburg Conference.\nMy deepest thanks to all of you.\nPS--It would be nice if each of us could sign up two or three new\nindividual Members of NAEB, wouldn’t it?
