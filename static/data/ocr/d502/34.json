Louis, to give you an exaeaple\nof the sort of problem I referred to for th® consultant problem. I can’t\naccurately say how general the problem is but expect It will grow with TV.\nOff-hand there might not at first be much. Cohn and Marks started on a\nvoluntary basis, with only reimbursement far actual expenses (travel, etc.).\nThey this year presented a bill for 11,100.00, which the Board didn’t\nhonor, because it was, they felt too high, frankly we don’t haw funds far\nthis now, but w© haw requested several thousands for consultant services\nas needed. In such coses X think perhaps §100.00 a day plus expenses on\npersonal consultation, or perhaps a §200.00 or §300.00 consultatlcai re¬\ntainer basis, if any charge at all, far replying to occasional questions\nlike the attached might do it. As the amount or intensity of work be¬\ncomes mare obvious, perhaps in a month, or a year, wo could work out a\nmore equitable arrangement.\nThis whole consultant area is so new to HAEB that X hesitate own to send\nthe above. Uby don’t you get your ideas in, on the basis of your ©»-\nperionoG with consultant’s fees, before we get into any further official\nconsideration? How about that? Xf you’d rather not get involved at all.\nI’m sure all would understand.\nRegards,\nHarry J. Skarnia\nExecutive Director\nHJStms\nEnclosure"
