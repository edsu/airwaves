Ai\nthe same time, while the AFC voltage is\nremoved, the residual charge on the stor¬\nage capacitor of the reactance-tube\ndriver remains at a substantially con¬\nstant potential over periods of several\nminutes, thus holding or freezing the\nhigh-frequency oscillator at a frequency\nin close proximity to its last-corrected\nfrequency. In normal operation, when\ncarrier is present, the AFC circuit is rela¬\ntively immune to high noise peaks or in¬\nterference from jamming signals because\nof the protection afforded by the crystal\nfilter, limiter, and crystal discriminator.\nThe 100-kc. signal voltage, after pass¬\ning through the crystal carrier filter and\nthe carrier amplifier, is rectified by an\nAVC diode. Normally, it is then applied\nto the AVC circuit of the communication\nreceiver to provide protection against in¬\nterference which might otherwise gain\ncontrol of the AVC system. When used\nin a diversity system, the AVC voltage is\napplied to the diversity combiner, de¬\nscribed below, and is afterward fed back\nto the communication receiver. A switch\npermits the AVC system to be controlled\neither from the filtered and rectified\ncarrier alone, as above indicated, or from\nthe total rectified signal and sidebands,\nwhich is advantageous for tuning pur¬\nposes. The carrier meter furnishes visual\nindications of signal level and proper\ntuning.\nDiversity Combiner: The operating\nprinciple of the diversity combiner,\nshown in Fig. 6, is that of a diode gate\ncontrolled by the rectified signal so that\nthe gate selects automatically the audio\noutput from the receiver having the\nstrongest rectified carrier or total signal.\nThe audio signal from each channel of\neach receiver, Fig. 7, is fed through its\nindividual diode gate to a common load\nresistor, incorporated in a push-button\nswitching unit. DC voltage from the\nAVC circuit of each receiver is fed to the\nrespective audio diode gates of each\nchannel through isolating resistors, as\nshown in the diagram, and directly to an\nAVC diode gate. The diode gates act as\ncontrolled resistances, each of which has\na low value when the bias from the recti¬\nfied signal is high, and a high value when\nthe bias is low. The audio voltage fed\nthrough the controlled resistance to the\ncommon load resistance, therefore, is\nselected primarily from the receiver with\nthe strongest rectified carrier or total\ncarrier at any given moment.\nThe selected audio voltage in each\naudio channel is applied to one of the\naudio amplifiers in the combiner, and the\nDC voltage from the strongest signal is\nfed back to the individual receivers\nCovering the Coronation\nDespite Magnetic Storm\nWe take pleasure in informing you that during\nour coverage of the recent British Coronation ceremonies\nyour diversity single-sideband receiver Model 155 main¬\ntained high quality reception tinder trying conditions.\nThe Importance of your Crosby Trip]\nSingle-Sideband Receiver, Model 155, in our c\nBritish Coronation ceremonies cannot be over-\nWe depended on this remarkable receiver, as v\nModel 154H, for both precision performance ar\nreliability under the most severe conditions\nference and fading.\nSINGLE-SIDEBAND AND EXALTED CARRIER DIVERSITY RECEIVERS • BROADCAST AND COM-\nMUNICATIONS APPARATUS • MULTIPLEX TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING EQUIPMENT\nCOMPLETE ENGINEERING SERVICE\nFounded in 1948, Crosby Laboratories, Inc. is an engineering, development and\nproduction firm whose accomplishments include many original contributions\nto the science of long-range radio communications.
