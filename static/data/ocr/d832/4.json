In\ngeneral, these formal sessions covered areas of delegate background and experience;\nthe history of the NAEB: broadcasting philosophy; NAEB Headquarters, Network and\nCommittee functions; NAEB-Fulbright cooperation; Radio-TV developments in Region I;\nquestion and answer sessions, and group discussion and business sessions. Each of\nthe six formal sessions was individually reviewed.\nOpening Session\nProfessor Anthony Zaitz, WMQA, University of Massachusetts, served as chair¬\nman of the opening session. Mr. Zaitz extended an official welcome from the Uni¬\nversity of Massachusetts to the NAEB delegates, and expressed the official regrets\nof Mr. Macandrew, Director of Region I, on his inability to attend the Conference.\nThe Chairman called on each member to introduce himself, including a little back¬\nground on his institution’s activities in educational broadcasting. The follow¬\ning examples of responses are representative:\nDorothy. Daniel. WQED„ Pittsburgh. Pa: \"I’m here representing WQED, Pittsburgh.\nWe were the first community TV station on the air with no state funds nor any\nallegiance to a college or university. When we were first set up, there were four¬\nteen colleges and universities that gave all the help they could but now we are on\nour own. We are mainly community-supported and are mostly a volunteer staff\nwith some professionals. We are on the air 40 hours a week and our outstanding\nprograms are a really good children’s program and a high school hour, both of which\nare aired daily. We originally began with in-school broadcasting which we thought\nwould be no problem at all with a captive audience but which has turned out to be\none of our biggest headaches. We certainly don’t know all the answers on this\nproblem and are now more or less on the fance and profiting from our own mistakes.”"
