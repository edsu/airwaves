Seibert, Pag© 3, February 12, 1960\nthe $3,165.10 which w© can save before the terminal date of this project, as\nmodified, June 30, I960.\nThis whole project is so big that 1 feel a whole research department, with Mar*\nshall as consultant, is really necessary to carry it out. 1 would hope that\nthe start we*ve made with him will provide a plateau or launching pad from\nwhich others, or we, eventually can (again) take off.\nIf my efforts to get this re*plotted make some sense to you, we're agreeable\nto these changes. If there's anything further we can do, please let me know.\n1 expect the 15% indirect expenses to us will later need to be computed on the\nnew total. We'll be glad to return the difference, along with the other balance,\nwith out'final report, within some two months of completion of the project.\n(The lag occasioned by clearance of vouchers and bills.)\nThanks for your patience. And if you have other suggestions, please let me\nknow. I'm sure we can work them out.\nSincerely,\nHarry J, Skornia\nPresident\nhjstrs\nCC: Dr. Marshall McLuhan\nDr. Sam Becker, Research Committee Chairman"
