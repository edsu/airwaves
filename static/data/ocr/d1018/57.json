I welcome the opportunity to confer with you and Loren on the\nagenda before the meeting.\nNAEB did not file a protest on the report of Jack McBride; it pro¬\ntested at the fact that it was omitted from the agenda of the Plenary Ses¬\nsions after it had been assured by the New York representative of RAI,\nhosting the meetings for EBU, that it was to make the American presenta¬\ntion. Hence, we arrived with the expectation of making the presentation\nthen found that we were not scheduled at all and that Mr. McBride, repre¬\nsenting the Center, was to give the U. S. report. We compromised by\nhaving Hull share a part of the time with him. There is more to the story\nthan this, but we certainly did not protest Jack McBride's report, which was\nexcellent.\nI look forward to seeing you and chatting with you about NAEB and\nits future.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH/vr"
