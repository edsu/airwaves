Its relevance outside the news¬\npaper, for radio or movie or t.v., is very small.\n***\nWas it the newly achieved power of press technology that led\nMarx, in the same way, to assume that the important thing\nabout the means of production was who owned them? Xt is\npuzzling to know how Marx managed to Ignore the media of\ncommunication, as the major factor in the process of social\nchange. For the means of production, especially since Guten¬\nberg, are so many footnotes, or appendages, of the printing\npress Itself. This fact appears, clearly, at present, when\nthe assembly-line is obsolete by reason of electric tapes\nentering and altering the production patterns. Print from\nmovable types was the archetype of all assembly-lines, and\nof all static analysis of movement.\n♦##\nThe form of the newspaper changed many times, as various\nchanges were made in the speed of type-setting, and of the\npresses. These changes in turn affected the process of news¬\ngathering and news-distribution. As Innis showed, the news¬\npaper hastened and paid for the development of highways, and\nwas inseparable from the development of modern postal services."
