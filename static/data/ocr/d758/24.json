Grady, Schooley, Sulzer and Stasheff\nAbsent: Emery, Hiller, Martin and Tyler\nThe Committee met at 4 p.m* at the Statler-Hilton Hotel in\nSt* Louis, in connection with the NAEB Convention*\nThe Chairman opened the meeting and called upon Schooley for two\nimportant announcements: (a) that the first issue of the year was\noff the presses and on its way to subscribers, and (b) that the\nnew Managing Editor of the Joumal would be Richard A. Atwood.\nSchooley &lso suggested the inclusion of the NAEB FACT SHEETS\n(Research) as a center-spread insert in the Journal, thus giving\nmembers of the NAEB two services in one* Th& Committee approved*\nStasheff submitted to the Committee a high school course of study\nin Radio and Television Speech, which was being offered to the\nCommittee for publication by the Michigan Speech Association, for\nwhom it had originally been prepared. After some discussion, it\nwas agreed that the material would be of value to the non-college\nmembers, and that it should be published in some form. Schooley\nsuggested that it be run serially in the five issues between\nJanuary and June, so that any subscriber could save the five Issues,\nextract the course of study, and rebind it himself as a pamphlet, if\nhe so wished. It was also suggested that the printer be asked to\nhold the type so that after the final installment had appeared, the\nentire manuscript could be reprinted as a pamphlet, to sell to high\nschool and Junior high school teachers throughout the nation, probably\nat a price of $1.00. These suggestions were unanimously approved*"
