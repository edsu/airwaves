  "text": "INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\nThis study of personnel in educational broadcasting1\nresearch was undertaken by the Research Committee of the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters to provide\nbasic information which would do two things: (1) build a\nroster of research workers in educational broadcasting and\n(2) compile a list of completed unpublished studies, and\ncurrent projects.\nThe need for information in this area is clear. The\nproblem of duplication in research effort and research results\nis obvious to anyone who has tried to keep abreast of such\nactivities in the area of radio-television.\nThere are many causes and some valid reasons for this\nduplication, but much of it is unnecessary. One cause is the\nlack of, or delayed, communication among researchers, includ¬\ning not knowing of the other's existence. This is illustrated\nby (1) the time-lag of two years and more between the beginning\nof a research project and its eventual availability in readily\naccessible print form, and (2) completed research which never\nsees the dark of ink.\n1The terms \"broadcasting\" and \"broadcaster\" as used in this\nreport refer to all personnel and all uses of radio and tele¬\nvision in education, regardless of the techniques of transmission."
