C. 20036\nDear Harold,\nThank you for your letter of January 22.\nOur public relations committee was pursuing the speakers\nguide project at the direction of Bill Harley. He suggested\na year or two ago that our committee work on a published\nNAEB speakers guide and it has taken this long to begin to\nget it off the ground. Evidentally in the intervening time\nyou people have changed your minds about the necessity of\nthis type of booklet. If so, we will discontinue the\nproject.\nSincerely,\nMarion Corwell\nAssociate Director\nMC/hJk\ncc: Lee Campion"
