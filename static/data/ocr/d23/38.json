  "text": "The logging of loop current ratios and magnitudes hourly should\nbe required rather than base current ratios. The loop current magnitudes\nwould provide a further check on common point impedance stability. Extensive\nexperience has indicated that loop currents may be relied upon to indicate\nrelative radiation magnitudes whereas base current magnitudes are frequently\nsubject to variations with seasonal changes and extremes of weather. Base\ncurrent magnitudes and ratios should be required to be logged only at weekly\ninspection intervals to keep a gross check on the possible gradual aging of\nsystem tuning components. Where sampling loop systems are not in existence\na reasonable time should be allowed for compliance with this requirement.\nSection 8(3)\n*?Whether and how often the Commission should require\nthe logging of phase relations;''\nIt is submitted that the logging of phase relations should be\nrequired only at the time of weekly transmitter plant inspection unless\nthe loop current values as logged hourly indicate a departure in excess of\nfive per cent of the allowable values for the current ratios. In this\nevent both phase and loop currents should be read at hourly intervals at\nthe transmitting location for the period during which a return to non-remote\ncontrol and operation is necessary.\nSection 8(4)\n’’Whether and to what extent any of the information\nrequired to be logged by present or proposed\nregulations may be logged by automatic recording\ndevices\nThe provisions of Rule 3*39(b) would appear to be sufficiently\nclear for any operation proposed to be approved and no further suggestions\nare indicated. However, automatic recording at the transmitter site for\n- 2 -"
