Teachers ask us frequently for such\nhelp* and we do not have the personnel nor the budget to\nhandle all the requests*,\nArlene McKellar, Associate Director, Wisconsin School of the Air\nWHA, University of Wisconsin, HadIson, Wisconsin\nLetter - June 19, 1961\n& is #\nImperative to good teaching of any subject at any level\nIs the ability to teach children to do effective thinking.\nOne of the finest things we can do for those who are learning\nto be good teachers Is to demonstrate the processes by which\nthe raw fuels of learning — the things, facts, experiences,\nand events — are converted into children's creative thought.\nIt is not enough to provide the most effective and efficient\nteaching aids available. We must show our teachers-to-be\nhow to use these promising tools toward the shaping of con¬\ncepts. Those who are skilled In the ways of working with\nchildren must show them how.\nDr. Clyde Inez Martin, Associate Professor of Curriculum and\nInstruction, The University of Texas, Austin, Texas\nJune 19, 1961\n* * * *\nFor the past several years we have worked on in-school\nTV utilization with steadily increasing success. We attribute\nthis success to the gradual development of a sense of in¬\nvolvement of our consumer group, the principals and teachers\nof the schools using the courses we offer on television.\nThis 'sense of involvement* is developed through participation\nof teachers and principals from the viewing area in planning\nworkshops and conferences during which schedules and teachers\nguides are outlined. The enthusiasm generated in these con¬\nferences Is carried back to the various communities by the\nparticipants who feel that they have made a substantial con¬\ntribution to the over-all program."
