The increasing population of young people\nof school age, the increasing trend of students to continue their schooling to\nhigher levels, and the critical needs in our nation for a more highly educated\ncitizenry have resulted in heavy demands for additional school and college\nfacilities, increasing numbers of qualified teachers and the financial resources\nrequired to provide them.\nI. General Provisions\n1. It is the intent of the Legislature that the Educational Television Agency\ncreated by this act shall provide the leadership and coordination of public\nand private effort necessary to (a) improve the quality of instruction;\n(b) conserve human resources, especially in those subject fields in which\nthe greatest shortages of qualified teachers exist; and (c) conserve the\nfinancial resources of the State in the building and expansion of schools,\ncolleges and universities in equipping and operating them.\nIt is recognized that the most effective use of both open and closed circuit\ntelevision, and the sharing on a state-wide basis of instructional material\nrecorded on video tape or film may markedly change the requirements for\nschool facilities, and call for a redeployment of teaching personnel. The\nuse of these media poses problems of avoiding costly duplication of effort\nwith the minimum disruption of existing jurisdictions in education. The\nEducational Television Agency shall therefore ordinarily supplement the work\nof existing agencies, but it may initiate action on its own behalf when the\nproblems are not, in the Agency's judgment, being adequately solved elseÂ¬\nwhere. The Agency will study with the teachers of the State the status,"
