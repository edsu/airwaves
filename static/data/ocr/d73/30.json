Although no rigid priority system is necessary, the\nopen-circuit broadcasts, it seems to me, should come first because they\nwould serve to showcase the virtues of televised education to the community\nin the most eloquent manner possible. Concurrently, in many places, would\ncome the closed-circuit systems and tape machines which would form the\nultimate hard core of instructional facilities, bringing the advantages of\nmultiple-channel television to every classroom in the nation.\nThe television tape machines would introduce a new flexibility\ninto the curriculum, enabling schools to schedule demonstrations and\nother programs at the most convenient hours. Television tape would also-\npermit major economies through the repeated use of outstanding presentations.\nWith all these elements functioning in concert, every community\nwould be able to select the finest program material appropriate to its own\nneeds. Far from imposing uniformity on local curriculums, these systems\nwould impart a richness and variety often lacking in todayâ€™s academic\nprograms. They would serve elementary and secondary schools, colleges\nand universities, and even adult education classes."
