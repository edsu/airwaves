This\ndoesn’t really fall into the \"equipment\" category so far as expenses are con¬\ncerned. These item® are legitimately a part of “supplies and expenses.\" We’ll\nhave no problem.\nOn your hotel receipts — I’ve discussed this problem with Harry, and he has\nsuggested that you might want to make up a statement for your hosts to sign,\nwhich could then take the place of a hotel bill. The statement might say some¬\nthing like: \"In lieu of staying at hotel, stayed with friends. Gift in lieu\nof hotel payment — (and then indicate the amount — this you could insert\nlater to avoid any ©s^arrassment)\", and the naans and address of your host, in\naddition to his signature, should be given.\nBelieve me, we wouldn’t be so concerned about this if it weren’t that this is\nall taking place under a government contract and they might get quite concerned\nif we were careless in their estimation. Even if you were operating on a per\ndiem basis (s*y, directly from the government rather than through us), you\nwouldn’t hare to hare receipts — but of course, you wouldn’t have over ilO.OO\nor $12.00 a day for all expenses that way.\nHope this seems like the best solution to you.\nCordially,\nHEH: jp\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
