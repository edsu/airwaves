Dine)\nGHETTO RADIO EXPERIMENT\nBACKED BY CPB\nNEW YORK, August 19 â€” FM radio programming originating from a\nstorefront studio in the Buffalo ghetto will be expanded under\na one-year grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\nThe CPB announced today an award of $30,440 to WBFO-FM, Buffalo,\nto expand the ghetto radio experiment it began last September.\nEach week in the studio, ghetto people have been creating about\nsix hours of programs of all kinds and putting them on the air\nover WBFO-FM. With the grant the number of programs will be more\nthan quadrupled through the next year.\nThe storefront studio was set up experimentally by\nWBFO-FM, the station of the University of New York at Buffalo, to\ndevelop a medium for the ghetto communities. A goal of the\nexperiment was to enable people in the ghetto to develop a new\nway to communicate news of the ghetto, to inform about jobs,\nprojects, programs, health measures, and to celebrate black\nculture and history. Although the main purpose of the experiment\nis to provide a special communications medium for the black\npopulation, it is hoped that the experiment can also make white\ncitizens more aware of what is happening in the ghetto.\n(MORE)"
