These included:\n- New York Television (11951 and 1952) by Dallas W. Smythe\n- Los Angeles Television (1951) by Dallas W. Smythe and\nAngus Campbell\n- r.hinaan Summer Television (1951) by Donald Horton, Hans Mauksch, K, Lane\n- New Haven Television (1952) by Dallas W. Smythe\n- Three Years of New York Television (1953) by Dallas W.\nSmythe\n- Four Years of New York Television (1954) by H. H. Remmers\n- Some Comparisons Between British and American Television\n(1954) by John T. Suchy\nCopies of these studies are being forwarded under separate cover.\nThey have been widely distributed throughout the U.S. and Canada, as well\nas to many foreign research scholars. They are the only studies extant which\nconcern themselves principally with content, techniques, and methodology\nfor the evaluation of television as an effective tool for the communication of\ninformation, attitudes and values in the formative stages of television in the\nfirst nation to use it.\nThe first study,even prior to final publication, served as one of the\nmost important single supporting documents in hearings before the Federal\nCommunications Commission at the time of the NAEB's successful efforts,\nalong with those of other organizations, to secure the allocation of television\nfrequencies specifically for educational use.\nSubsequent to the above studies the NAEB has turned its attention\nprincipally to ongoing services of a somewhat different nature as outlined\nbelow."
