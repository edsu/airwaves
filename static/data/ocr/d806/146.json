I\ndid this by going through the thousands of addresses we have here and\nputting a paper clip on the cards involved in this series* As soon as\nthe card was mailed, the paper clip was removed. The addresses w© now\nhave are those who received cards bearing John Holt1® and Rosaline\nBiason’s signatures (Network relations people at each of our member\nstations), those bearing a rubber stamp indicating that the card was\nfrom me (journalists abroad, people with whom we here do business on a\nday to day basis, etc. X signed none of these), blank ones from the\norganimtic ly, and those from the two of us.\nWe are now making up a careful Christmas list, so that next year this\ntype of improvisation will not be necessary. If you would like us to\nsend you the packet of cards in this compilation, for comment, please\nlet me know.\nThe attached list is, to ay knowledge, approadmately the list of the\npeople to whom jointly signed cards went.\nWhat with paying for the duplicator, and all the other over charges\nI’ve mentioned to you, our Headquarters* budget is down to almost aero.\nHave you any idea when funds will be available from Kellogg!\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJSims\nEnclosure"
