Harry J* Skomia\nconcerning^ in part, ways hy which we could help make the Sultan's visit\nto^America a success*\nYou suggested some English-language radio programs* Although our fall\nschedule is planned, I believe we could sneak in a special program on\nthe Sultan and Morocco. I suggest either one or two fifteen or thirty\nminute programs or one hour long program* It is too late for us to stick\na whole series into our fall schedule, but we can accomodate a special\nprogram or two.\nAt the present time we have some eighty (30) radio stations scattered\nacross the continental United States as well as in Hawaii and Puerto\nRico. I have no idea of how many listeners our stations can command,\nbut I assure you that all of the stations will receive the program or\npr<^ams you send.\nI look forward to heasdjog further from you regarding this matter.\nSincerely,\nREO/dfc\nRobert £• Underwood, Jr\nNetwork Manager"
