I am sure, however,\nyou understand at least a part of the reason.\nThe subcommittee votes one for, one against, with Mix\nnot voting. You have Slack*s letter, so you know his views.\nThough I think the idea is very good and could make a\nfine contribution to the network offering, I do not (thds\nprogram is one which will do it forthe following reasons:\n(1) Buell is too patronizing, and his effort at being\ninformal shows. Informality is only as good as it is\ngenuine.\n(2) There are unaccountable references and asides to\nthe announcer who makes absolutely no contribution to the\nbody of the program. And he is only an adequate announcer.\n(3) Partly because of no. 2, this sounds much like a\ntelevision program taped for radio. Both media are unique\nenough to require certain unique techniques and treatments.\n(4) There is some possibility that portions of the\nseries could become dated. In a sense it is somewhat dated\nfrom inception. (This is the least of my objections.)\nCarbons of this letter are going out as noted below.\nSincerely yours.\ncc: Waldo Abbott\nHugh Mix\nEd Slack\nJackr-'K. Westbrook (WUOT)\nChairman,\nAcceptance Subcommittee"
