A\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE\nDIVISION DF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION\nBOX B45Q, UNIVERSITY STATION\nKNOXVILLE\nRADIO AND TELEVISION SERVICES\nRADIO STATION WUOT\nJanuary 10, 1955\nTO\nJohn Holt, Waldo Abbot, Hugh Mix, Ed Slack\nPROM : Jack Westbrook\nSUBJECT: Chicago Roundtable, Stories ’n’ Stuff, Children1s\nCircle, and Schools Today\n3Lo I vote yes for continuing all fonr of these programs\non the net.\n2. I am least satisfied with Stories ’n’ Stuff, which I\nfeel talks down to the children frequently. However, since\nit is used by so many stations (including WUOT), I think they\nshould continue to have it available. I think it could be\nimproved easily by a more serious and a more genuinely friendly\napproach.\n3. Children’s Circle is excellent.\nij.. Schools Today is a workmanlike, thoughtful presentation,\nthough somewhat mundane presentation, of some vital aspects of\nthe current educational program. It should be of interest to\nevery station’s listeners.\n5* Actually, John, WUOT does carry Chicago Roundtable.\nWe get it from the local NBC affiliate, running the week of\nthe broadcast.\n6. I have not received the votes of Mix and Slack, but,\nsince you will be receiving copies of their views, I thought\nthis might speed up final decision on these programs.\nack Westbrook\nL"
