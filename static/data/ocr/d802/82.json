The\nreadings had no more life than the commentary.\n(4) The Melian Conference -- u. of Chicago\nSame as above. This stuff requires people who know\nhow to act, not just read. This presentation seemed\nto have a minimum regard Tor meaning.\n(£) The Hour Glass — U. of Chicago\nA muddled, messy production. Listener is not oriented\nto either the situation or the characters. Poor\npacing, poor handling and balance on crowds, and a\nlot of frantic attempts at gaiety by the giggling\n\"schoolboys\". We had difficulty*figuring out what\nYeats was trying to say, and I doubt if the average\nlistener would make much effort after the first 3-4\nminutes. This was a poor choice for radio presenta¬\ntion.\n(6) What We Laugh At -- U. of Chicago\nMaterial here should have some interest, but Professor\nBlair was pretty slow and soporific in his delivery.\nOne auditor listening with us literacy went to\nsleep.\nThat takes care of all we’ve received to date.\nHope you’re having a good summer, and best regards.\nnd/pac\nNorthrup Dawson, Jr.\nActing Manager\nKUOM"
