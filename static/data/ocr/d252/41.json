Therefore, the immediate reaction\nof the townsfolk against the Governments requisitioning order\nwas not merely apprehension concerning compensation# It Ytfas,\nrather* absolute opposition to the idea of being deprived of\ntheir land#\nThat*s right. Compensation is not the prime thing. But, did\nyou know it takes at least three months—and more often six\nmonths before the compensation is actually paid in cash? When\na claim for compensation is put in, the appropriate authorities\nfrom both sides have to start investigations into the cir¬\ncumstances surrounding the accident, and it often happens that\ntrouble arises between the two sides in the course of such\ninvestigations.\nAnother problem, more serious in one way than the ones we have\nalready dealt with, arises in the wake of 0fraternisation*\nactivities by American troops. The fault doubtless lies partly\nin the fact that Japan has no definite laws dealing with the\nquestion of prostitution. It also lies, however, in the\npoverty which is as widespread as ever, and in the prevalence\nof petty operators who will do anything to scrape together a\nlivelihood.\nYes, wherever there is an American base, women of a certain\ntype gather together in droves, and hastily improvise\namusement centres which spring up overnighta The problem of\nsuch \"fraternisation” is more difficult in Japan than in\nEuropean countries where American troops have be@n stationed*\nThis is doubtless due to racial differences and differences in\ncustoms and ways of life, which are far more conspicuous here\nthan in Europe,\n-5 -"
