Wednesday morning) we have three microphones and two\ncameras (all University of Minnesota property) set up on the stage in Northrop\nAuditorium with which we are testing both sound and sight pickup for the first\ntelecast which will be on January iu Here, you see, we are using our closed\ncircuit equipment to supplement the television station facilities which will be\nused when we go on the air* This combination has been working so well in teaching\nus television that X think it could work well in teaching others too.\nUn page 2 you mention 1*00 trainees within the next 18 months, I don't know\nwhat the exact number should be â€” it may be that we can't train that many people\nwell, but anyway we can train a corp for each area of the country.\nWell, Jim, that's not a complete answer to your project, but it will give\nyou a little idea how my thinking is going.\nWith best regards for a happy holiday season.\nlours sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nManager\nBPtcjra\ncc: Graydon Ausmus/"
