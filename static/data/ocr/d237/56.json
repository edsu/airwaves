Sine© this is\n©esentially an experimental projects and since w© shall want to examine it oar©*\nfully at each stage before recommending or considering it aa a regular project*\nthis is to request approval of half the originally requested mm for testing this\ntechnique on an initial basis of six months or six visits (at an estimated maxi¬\nmum of 11*200,00 per visit as outlined In our earlier letter), whichever occurs\nfirst* beginning Marsh 1, 1955* This will therefore formalise th® oral dissuasion\nheld with you on this projects requesting $7*200.00 for visitations as outlined*\nand $300,00 for reporting* for a total of $7*500.00.\nIf* on th© basis of results achieved by this initial grant* it is believed\nmutually desirable to regularise it* m shall discuss with you a request for\nplacing this servic© also on a regular fiscal year basis (for perhaps completing*\nby June 30* 1956* the project as originally outlined but with changes which\nexperience indicates as dosirebil®),\nAt the time of our recent conference* w@ also discussed jagaaiSk^EgiaS^\nand areas in which th© NAEB would be interested in securing FAE support. These\nwould supplement the many ongoing Coagaittee-direoted Research Projects in which\nth© NAEB regularly ©ngagae* and would be in area® not thought to b© of primary\nconcern to th© ETBC. Several such areas (needed inventory of research^ TV as a\ndirect teaching tool \\ operations! and staff data) have already been discussed in\nan exchange of letters, copies of which have, I believe* gone to you and\nDr, Harry Nswburn of th© Center.\nBefore presenting specific proposal© for support of research now believed\nto b© more urgently needed than a continuation of earlier TV Monitoring Studies*"
