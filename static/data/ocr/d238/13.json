The action will be taken under mandate of the NAB\nboard as a result of '’unsettled conditions'* cause by failure\nof FCC to solve the clear-ohannel problem*,\nDelay in resolving the dear-channel issue prevents the State\nDept*, from forming its policy in preparation for the NARBA\nmeeting in Canada next September, it was felt by the boardo\nCollapso of NARBA would mean unrestricted pirating of domestlo\nchannels by other nations, the board was informed at its New\nOrleans meeting. These channels would include local, regional\nand clear facilities. The result would be degradation of service\nto the American listener and perhaps \"chaos** in the industry, the\nworst in a decade»and-a-half. Other nations would pounce on U.\nS. frequencies at will and create intolerable interference, the\nboard was told.\nThe board directed that its NARBA committee, with several engin¬\neering members, confer at once with Sen. Edwin C. Johnson (D-Colo.)\nand Rep, Robert Grosser (D-Qhio), chairmen, respectively, of the\nSenate and House Interstate Commerce Committees, as well as FCC\nChairman ?;ayne Coy in an effort to resolve the dear-channel mat¬\nter. President Justin Millar is to sit with the committee."
