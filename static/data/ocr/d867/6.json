  "text": "January 3, 1969\nMEMORANDUM\nTO: William Harley\nFROM: Robert Mott\nSUBJECT: Recommendation on the Powell Proposal\nIt is difficult to put a ’’handle1' on this material.\nPowell describes the document as the opening shot in\na campaign and then presents a position paper rather\nthan a document for action.\nThe only action proposal that I can read into the\npaper is at the bottom of page three and top of page\nfour. His proposals are valid but imprecise.\nMy recommendation: We meet with Powell to determine\nif there is, in fact, a way in which some progress can\nbe made along the lines he suggests. I'm not optimistic\nbut his idea has merit and is wcrth hearing more about.\nFor our part, we should advise Powell of the efforts\nwe are making in the areas of his interest.\nRAM:Ik1"
