Schooloy\nChairman\nNAEB Publications Committee\n227 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Prank,\nIt is readily understandable why you donft\nlike questionnaires, especially if you have\nreceived many of a nature similar to the one\nyou sent out.\nEnclosed please find said questionnaire.\nEach article and feature of the 1962 issues\nof the NAEB Journal has been evaluated, including\nthe Research Fact Sheets, which I couldnâ€™t find\non the questionnaire.\nSince the purpose of this study was to analyze\nthe contents of the Journal, one evaluation per\narticle seems sufficient. Therefore, there are\nblank spaces in the questionnaire. The busy work\nof finding cross references to the same article\ncan be handled on your end, if itTs necessary.\nBest wishes for a joyous and happy new year.\nSincerely,"
