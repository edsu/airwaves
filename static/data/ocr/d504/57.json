On this channel are carried unpublished radio plays both\nfrom Yugoslavia and from abroad, experimental and stereo productions.\nEight plays are planned to be recorded in stereo during 1971\nof which three will have been written by Yugoslav authors. In addition.\nRadio Belgrade plans to equip a special studio with electro-acoustic\ninstruments this year.\nWithout counting the short programmes of humour and variety.\nRadio Belgrade produces altogether some 150 original drama productions\nper year.\nRadio Ljubljana recently carried out a major enquiry on\nthe impact of radio drama on the audience and found that its popularity\nhad dropped from lith to 7th place. It has recognized the importance\nof the afternoon audience and now tends to concentrate on this,\nproducing, inter alia, some 20 new plays each year.\nHUNGARY\nThe Hungarian Radio has two principal channels of which the\nfirst is on the air for 2k hours per day and carries all drama producÂ¬\ntions. Every week a new play is produced and broadcast and in total,\nincluding repeats, some 280 drama broadcasts go out each year. It is\nthe experience of the Hungarian Radio that repeats frequently gain\nmore listener attention than first broadcasts. In view of the national\ncharacter of the weekly premieres and the wide listening audience for\nthem, they do not normally contain much of an experimental nature.\n* # #\n* *"
