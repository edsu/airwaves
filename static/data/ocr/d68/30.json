This does not suggest that utilization begins and ends with the\nlesson itself. The lesson has been planned to encourage, invite,and\nsuggest classroom activities which prepare for the lesson, extend the\nlesson, and reinforce the lesson.\nThis is only one kind of lesson, designed to teach a particular\nsubject, and to lend support in one particular area at one particular\nlevel. It is an example of television used as a major resource in science\nat an upper primary, lower intermediate developmental level. Other\nlessons, used for other purposes at other levels of development and sup¬\nport, would be planned and designed in different ways.\nD-7"
