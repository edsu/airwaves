Becker, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\nDivision of Television, Radio, Film\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nI am sorry that I didn't have a chance to see you except for a\nmoment at the NAEB meeting in Washington. I never did know whether the\nNAEB Research Committee had a meeting and I am chagrir/Jthat I did not\nanswer your letter of September 27 regarding t his. It was delayed in\ngetting to me since I was en route from Oregon for several weeks at that\nparticular time. As I told you when we bumped into each other at the\nMarriott Hotel, I am now in New York State doing a study on the potential\nof television in higher education with the possibility of developing a\nstate wide ETV network. If there are any developments in terms of other\nETV stations in Iowa or plans for any sort of a state network, I would\nappreciate your sending me information of this nature on to me. ETV\ndevelopments in other states will be of particular interest to powers\nthat be here in the State of New York.\nI trust that all is going well with you and yours at. the University\nof Iowa. I regret I didn't have a chance to talk with you at greater\nlength but perhaps I will^t to see you at the Speech Association meeting\nin New York City right after Christmas. If I can be of any assistance,\nfrom a distance, as far as the NAEB Research Committee is concerned, please\ncall upon me. Extend my best to Clay Harshbarger the next time you see him.\nKindest personal regards.\nGS:dc"
