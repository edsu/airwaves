ROSE\nUNIVERSITY\ntheo wright Dear Bill:\nBIRMINGHAM\nThank you for your letter of June 1 and the information regarding\nthe NAEB filing on its spectrum study. I would like to have a\ncopy of your filing for general informational purposes.\nI have in hand a copy of Hartford Gunn's letter to you which\nseems to ease the tension somewhat on the matter of experi¬\nmental program production. However, Dick Burdick's letter of\nJune 1 seems to rebel somewhat.\nThe letter copy to you from Michael Collins of WNED-TV seems\nto stem from Dick Burdick's stimulation. He has a right to write\nbut the threat is unacceptable. If this matter continues to fester,\na conference call of your executive committee might be wise.\nSTAFF\nRAYMOND D.
