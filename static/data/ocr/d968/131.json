  "text": "April 20, 1967\nThe Honorable Quentin IT. Burdick\nSenate of th© United States\nWashington, D.C.\n©oar Sirs\nThis is in response to your kind letter informing me\nof your support for the Public Television Act of 1957 (S. 1X60).\nX speak for my colleagues at the University of North Dakota\nBroadcasting Service as well as myself is* estprossing deep\nappreciation for your positive position. Your statement before\nthe Communications Subcommittee on April 13, 1957, was pro¬\nfoundly encouraging to all of us. Wo especially appreciated\nyour citing our music program distributed throughout the state.\nYour views of the broad definition for the term\n“educational\" in reference to use of the broadcast media seemed\nespecially appropriate. Your final paragraph regarding equitable\ndistribution of funds was an excellent recommendation, and if\nadopted, should assist greatly in the development of smaller\ninstallations lilic ourselves.\nYou may be interested in learning of indications that\nto the extent that the leadership prevails of the National\nAssociation of Broadcasters (NAB), the commercial broadcasting\nindustry will fee cautious but generally supportive of the\nlegislation for public television and radio. This is very\nencouraging to us.\nMay I draw your attention to the title of S. 1160? As\nthe title now reads, it omits recognition of radio. It would\nseem more appropriate if the modification read, \"Public Broad¬\ncasting Act of 1967\". Such a change would reconcile the title\nmore appropriately to tho inclusion of radio in the substance\nof th© act."
