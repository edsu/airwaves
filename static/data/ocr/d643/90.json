  "text": "♦ i. -\n~2~\nI hope you will give consideration when you meet in St. Louis\n(early in the convention, I hopeI) to our basic procedures in\nnominating and electing officers. Many organizations almost\nautomatically advance the vice president to the presidency. In\nfact, many of them call the \"vice president” the \"president elect.”\nIf done, this might suggest tHe need for more than one vice\n§ residential nomination, so that the real contest would be there.\nhis procedure has much to recommend it, it seems to me. If done.\nIt should Insure more continuity in policy. I hope you will\nconsider this when you meet.\nHowever this may be, I urge you to determine the availability\nof all nominees in advance (whether or not the nominees are at\nSt. Louis). Otherwise, your plans may be upset by withdrawals.\nThen there is the question of when you announce your\nnominations. The consensus at the Board meeting referred to above\nwas that this be done prior to the session at which the voting is\ndone. I personally like this, since it avoids the suggestion of\n\"fixing” which may arise if members have too short a time to react.\nBut here again, I leave procedures to you.\n(You will be concerned only with nominations for the four\nnational offices: president, vice president, secretary, and\ntreasurer. Regional directors are now nominated and elected within\ntheir respective regions, details being arranged by headquarters.\nIn 1957 we shall be electing the directors for Regions 1, 3 and 5*\nThe term of director at large—‘Gertrude Broderick-«does not expire\nuntil 1958.)\nBP :ds"
