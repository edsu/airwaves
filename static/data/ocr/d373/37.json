Wolf\nCoordinator for Citizen Participation\n400 Maryland Avenue, Room 4111\nWashington, D. C. 80202\nDear Mrs. Wolfs\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to meet with\nyou and William Whalen in your office this week. It is my con¬\nviction that educational radio and television must play an\nimportant part in your responsibility to involve the com¬\nmunity in education and I mean to do all we can to assist you.\nCommissioner Howe'# memorandum to chief state\nschool officers on involving the community In the Elementary,\nSecondary Education Act seems to me something we ought to\nput before all of the educational broadcasters in the nation.\nThere are many ways in which they could be of value in\ncarrying forward these objectives in each of their commu-\nities. For this purpose, we would like to request 400 copies\nof that memorandum in order that we may distribute it to all\nstations. I’d appreciate it therefore if you could supply these\nto me.\nAs I look at the request that each community form\nits own committee, it occurs to me that it would be logical to\nassume a national committee might evolve from these many\nlocal committees. Is this a possibility? If so, lean see\neducational broadcasting feeing put to good use nationally to\ncarry forward the objectives of such a national committee.\nThank you for giving me your copy of \"Tell It Like It\nIs. M I think this would make an excellent television presenta¬\ntion and intend to pursue that development.\nIncidentally, I don't want us to forget the possibility\nof repeating the school TY series, HQae Nation Indivisible. \""
