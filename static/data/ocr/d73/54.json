Televi¬\nsion tape would also permit major economies\nthrough the repeated use of outstanding presen¬\ntations.\nWith all these elements functioning in concert,\nevery community would be able to select the\nfinest program material appropriate to its own\nneeds. Far from imposing uniformity on local\ncurriculums, these systems would impart a rich¬\nness and variety often lacking in today’s academic\nprograms. They would serve elementary and sec¬\nondary schools, colleges and universities, and\neven adult education classes.\nI believe the three accomplishments I have\noutlined would solve our basic national education\nproblem within a decade, and it is against the\nbackdrop of this probability that the cost of $2y2\nbillion should be evaluated. Today, education\nrepresents our largest single category of public\nspending next to national defense—$19 billion a\nyear. What we are talking about for television\nfacilities, then, is 13 per cent of one year’s budget.\nNevertheless, to raise such a sum, a supreme\neffort will be required by every element involved\nin education—Federal, State and Local Govern¬\nments, Foundations, Business and Industry, and\nother private sources. It will not be easy, any\nmore than the shift from planes to missiles was\neasy in a military sense. But it will be just as\nsignificant to education as missilry is to security.\n7"
