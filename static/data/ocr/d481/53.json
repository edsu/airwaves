Skornla\n1015 West Church Street\nChampaign, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nToday I stopped In at the \"Ask Mr. Foster\" travel service and asked\nMrs. Adams, who took car of our trip, to write you about accomodations ,\nsailing dates, rates, etc. She also picked out a handful of brochures\nto send along.\nI honestly think the small cottage owned by Gilbert Cooper, about\nwhich I told you, would be well-suited. It's small, but cozy; hidden\nIn a grove of trees, but right on the brtnk of a cliff overlooking the\nocean.\nAs I told you,,there are many luxurious hotels. The Bermudlana, where\nwe stayed for a while, Is new and well situated with reference to\ndowntown Hamilton stores, bars, movies, etc. Three hotels that I am\nsure you would not like are: Castle Rock, Belmont Harbor, and the\nPrincess. They are huge, agresslveiy exuberant, and peopled by portions\nof our affluent society with compulsions toward exlbltlontstlc recreation.\nI feel confident that you will have a wonderful time there and If you are\nboth good sailors I would strongly recommend your going by boat. It's\na pleasant voyage (unless you run Into storms) and Jewell and I enjoyed\nIt very much on our second honeymoon ten years ago.\nCordially yours.\nWGH:rkf\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident"
