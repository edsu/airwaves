Incidentally, four of the Radio members\nof the Board are equally involved in ETV and are no less concerned with its\nwelfare than the TV members.\nAs to your reasons for being disturbed about the NAEB—I certainly hope\nyou will take the time for indicating what they are. We are always interested\nin critical comments of members since there is no point in its existence except\nto serve the membership. As you know, a week-long seminar at Madison last\nsummer was devoted entirely to an exhausting self-examination of NAEB and\nwhat its proper role and function should be. In two weeks time we will hold a\nfollow-up seminar designed to digest and refine these recommendations and\nsuggest means for their implementation. I believe a study of this report will\nreveal the conscientious self-analysis which NAEB is continuing to make.\nCertainly NAEB must be responsive to changing needs and circumstances;\nconsequently, it needs to be sensitive to all new influences and wherever it\nfinds functions are being fully provided by other agencies, move on to new\nareas where it can provide services not adequately available. Certainly self-\npreservation in itself is indefensible; the only raison detre for NAEB is to work\nfor the continued strengthening of educational broadcasting and the status and\nstature of educational broadcasters.\nSincerely yours.\nWilliam G.
