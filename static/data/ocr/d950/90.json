We have felt that commercial\nor market research, or *‘audience-counting\" was leaving a serious void in an\narea which deserved and needed far more basic study.\nThe modest funds at the disposal of the NAEB were not adequate to finance\nsuch studies fully. Neither were they adequate to maintain a full time Director\nor Coordinator of Research. However, a modest program of research grants-in-\naid was developed and carried out by the NAEB Research Committee to encourage\nand assist young graduate research scholars particularly and educational institu¬\ntions interested in embarking upon significant research for the first time, with\nsmall sums of up to $500.00 to provide assistance of the kind essential to make\nthese projects significant and valid. Since these grants were made on an applica\ntion basis, this procedure also made it possible to have these projects reviewed\nin advance, by members of the NAEB Research Committee, who were able to pro¬\nvide guidance and assistance available only from such experienced research\nspecialists.\nAlthough funds available were never adequate to provide the support we\nwould have liked, we believe that new wellsprings of research have been dis¬\ncovered by this procedure, and many new techniques and problems have been\nattacked which otherwise would have received no encouragement."
