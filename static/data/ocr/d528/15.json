(202) 667-6000\nJune 26, 1970\nCONFIDENTIAL\nMEMORANDUM\nTO; NER Affiliates Responding to Amendment Requiring Record\nKeeping of Programs on Issues of Public Importance\nFROM; Robert A. Mott, Executive Director, NER\nROBERTA. MOTT\nExecutive Director\nBecause of the volume of response, we are using this means to thank all\nwho responded to our inquiry in our Memo to Managers #73 concerning the\namendment relating to the maintenance of records of programs with issues\nof public importance.\nAs we reported in our Memo to Managers #75, the House version of this\nlegislation does not include the amendment. It is the view of the NAEB\nstaff, after analyzing responses from public radio and television sta¬\ntion managers and program directors, that we should take appropriate\naction to eliminate the amendment from the Public Broadcasting Financing\nAct of 1970 legislation.\nWe have moved and will continue to take appropriate actions in this\nregard.\nResponses from radio stations made it clear that managers were concerned\nabout the proposed amendment. In the main, your responses opposed the\namendment, although some stations acknowledged activity in this area as\nrequired by state law or as dictated by good business practice.\nTo those of you who suggested that the amendment would be burdensome\nand economically difficult, we concur but hasten to point out that\npublic radio can no longer stand on the ground that \"we can’t afford\nit\" and \"we don’t have staff for it\". This may be true but the climate\nis such that it is not a particularly persuasive argument."
