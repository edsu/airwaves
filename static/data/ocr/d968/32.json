R. 6736)\nThe following is a draft of the statement about which we talked by phone today:\nThe companion measures supporting public broadcasting, now\npending in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives\n(S, 1160 and R hU 6736) clearly indicate the substantial national\nimportance attached to public broadc?=,sting in our nation.\nIn Jorth Dakota, the potential benefits to both media seea\nequally clear, ac do the benefits to the state as a whole. Although\nthe university of Horth Dakota has managed to sustain modest radio\nbroadcasting facilities for nearly 44 years, its closed circuit\ntelevision installation has been even more restricted in its\ncapabilities. Television broadcasting facilities are still unde¬\nveloped.\nBotii media have clearly demonstrated their capabilities as\neducational and cultural resources. They have lacked significant\nsupport because of more immediate, pressing educational needs. If\nthey now receive the necessary support, they can assist in satisfying\ncome of these needs and possibly can aid in retarding the distressing\nflow of young people from rural to urban areas, and the exodus of\npopulation from our state.\n(continued)\nPRESS\nUNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA\nGRAND FORKS\n• BUY NORTH DAKOTA PRODUCTS* '"
