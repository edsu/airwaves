In the\nmeantime, it is a feasible and useful HAS® service. It is\none of the tangible evidences that our organisation recog¬\nnises research as a cornerstone to progress in educational\nbroadcasting.\n3. Plans and machinery for the get sheet service must be coordi¬\nnated with the expanding pattern of HAsSft development.\nThe first phase is now outgrown.

He might carry the title of research coordinator. Harry\nwould then be freed from all except keeping a paternal eye on the proceedings.\n3. Hext year, or as soon as the budget permits, employ half time\nor full time a thorou^ily qualified and experienced research coordinator.\nHe would supervise the Fact sheet service as a part of his work in assisting"
