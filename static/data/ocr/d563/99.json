Now this can be\ntaught better, and more briefly, in a televised\nlesson where the teacher has had as much as two\nor three solid days to prepare. And, of course, in\nan elementary-grade classroom, you wouldn’t\nwant to fool around with live snakes and with\ncharges of electricity, things that can be handled\nsafely in a televised lesson.\n“Neither I nor my pupils regard the television\nteacher as a distant, mechanical person. I used to\nthink I knew most of the tricks of the teaching\ntrade and could be coldly objective about an¬\nother teacher’s performance. But you know, when\nthe time comes in a televised music lesson for the\nchildren to sing, I find myself joining right in\nwith them in full voice, not just because I ought\nto, but because I’m just as taken with the lesson\nas the children are. I’ll tell you something else,\ntoo: I don’t have the voice the music teacher on\ntelevision has!\n“Far from diminishing the teacher in the class¬\nroom, ETY makes the classroom teacher loom\nlarger in the children’s eyes. The better a tele¬\nvised lesson is taught, the more curiosity it\narouses, and once youngsters are started off on a\nround of questions, you’d better be on your toes.\nTelevision keeps us classroom teachers moving,\nand if that makes life harder, it’s made easier by\nthe fact that we learn new ways of presenting\nour subjects to our pupils by watching other\nteachers in action. ’ ’"
