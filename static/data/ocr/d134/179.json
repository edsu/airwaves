I learned a lot about advertising from a grade\nVIII class in one hour. But we worked on specific examples.\nIf you offer generalizations for them to swallow or reject,\nnobody learns anything. No insight occurs. Understanding\nMedia,therefore, is not to be a capsule of existing views\nabout the media, but a series of procedures with specific\nmaterials and exercises which will in turn generate many^\nnew insights and exercises when it gets into use.\nI know from long experience that it is not helpful\nto have a lot of views about poems, ad s, or other art\nforms to heave at a class. The fruitful thing is for\nteacher and student together to get into the poem ,ad,\netc. Remember the TV syndrome: light through, not light on.\nIn learning and teaching this implies that the subject\nreveals itself, is defined or revealed in the very act\nof being creatively perceived.\nThis mode of learning and teaching utfiich our age has\nseen developing in all fields is also one which reduces\nthe former gap between child and adult to a great degree.\nSo, Sam*s question about what level the book is aiming at\ncan be answered (a) in terms of the conventional andaecepted\neducational patterns, or (b)in terms of the new media. In\nconventional terms I conceive that we might aim at dual\nversions of the text for elementary and secondaay school"
