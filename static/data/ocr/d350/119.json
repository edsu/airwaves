The biggest limiting\nfactor is lack of studio time. Fortunately, the radio budget\nis bigger than ever before. This year for the first time we\nhave separate accounts and staff for television production.\nWe're still having to do our television shows over a San Ant¬\nonio station, but KTBC-TV is due on the air in December. We\nlook forward to the convenience and economy of producing TV\nshows in Austin.\nI'm pleased to be considered for the position of\nExecutive Director of the N.A.E.B. It is certainly the kind\nof post I would like to move on to upon leaving the University\nof Texas. With the end of my doctoral pursuit reasonably with¬\nin reach, I am in the market for a new appointment. If I can¬\nnot better myself by going elsewhere, I may remain here at the\nUniversity. However, I would welcome a challenging assignment\nin a new location. The N.A.E.B. position would be ideal.\nIf I should need to become available for the N.A.E.B.\nposition, it could be arranged. I would prefer that Tom\nRousse and Acting President Dolley not be contacted concerning\nthis application unless the chips are really down. I don't\nwant them to think I would pull out of this job except under\nvery unusual circumstances. A1 Chapman you could contact\nimmediately. In fact I would appreciate your doing so.\nIf I have overlooked any Information you need, just\nlet me know. I would be glad to supplement the enclosed data\nsheet with additional details or further references."
