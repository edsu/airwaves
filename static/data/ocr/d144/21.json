DKARBORN, MICHIOAN\nLUZON 12011\nExt. 269\nApril 29, 1963\nMr. William Harley\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nThank you for your letter of April 22. Frances\nButler also wrote me and advised that she planned to\nresign from the committee. At this moment, I have no\nsuggestions of a replacement for her on the committee\nbut will give it some thought and let you know as soon\nas I come up with a name.\nIt was my impression that the new brochure published\nlast summer was a membership recruitment pamphlet. Do\nwe need another one so soon? The brochure you sent me\nfrom the ASAE is most impressive and I would be happy to\nwork with members of the committee on something similar\nfor the NAEB if you feel it is needed.\nI am tying up loose ends before leaving early Monday\nmorning for a week in Philadelphia, we will certainly miss\nyou at the AWRT Convention this year.\nAll the best.\nMC/ejh\nMarion Corwell\nAssociate Director"
