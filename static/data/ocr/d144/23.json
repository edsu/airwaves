I haven't checked\nwith him, and it's possible that we would be too late to add to the sche¬\ndule for this year.\nI'm sure Marion Corweli, chairman of the PR Committee, would be glad to\nhelp in any way she could*\nCordially,\n(Mrs.) Betty MeKensie\nPublications Editor\nBMCK/mp\nCCI Harold E* Hill\nMarion Corweli\nMarion: Lou ran a PR session at the Region II meeting, and in his report to\nme, he listed, briefly, a number of ideas used by various people. It seemed\nto me that this type of thing might make a good column from time to time in\ntbe Journal. (I doubt that we could get enough to make it an every-issue affair.)\nLou has agreed to collect and rewrite these items into a column, if people will\nsend him the material. The kick-off issue will be September-October, in which\nhis report of the Region II meeting will appear. This was practical stuff\ntbat a K gerson mi§ht be able to use—not the Cloud Nine type of thing some\nof our PR Committee members deal in! ®\n&"
