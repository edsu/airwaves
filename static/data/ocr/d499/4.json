G.P.O.,\nSYDNEY.\nOFFICE OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL\nCABLE ADDRESS: ASBUN, SYDNEY\n1st December 196?\nI am wondering whether you received my letter of 13 October explaining\nthat we like to publish some background information about new members in\nthe ABU Newsletter and would be very grateful to have a suitable statement\nfor this purpose*\nYou will have noticed that we published in the November issue some notes\nabout 4 of the 6 organisations which joined shortly before or during\nthe General Assembly and I was hoping that we would have a statement about\nNAEB for the December issue, which will be completed within the next\nfew days.\nI fully understand that you may have been away from Washington or may have\nhad some pressing work on hand but I hope that it will be possible for\nyou to let us have some material about NAEB in time for the January issue.\nI hope also that you received the parcel of documents relating to the\nrecent General Assembly which was sent to you from Singapore immediately\nafter the meeting. As I mentioned in my letter of 6 November, the\naddress on the parcel lacked detail, so we were a little concerned about\nwhether it would arrive safely.\nWith kindest regards,\nMr William G. Harley,\nPresident,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\n1346 Connecticut Avenue NW\nSuite 1101 Dupont Circle Building,\nWASHINGTON. D.C. 20036,\nU.S.A."
