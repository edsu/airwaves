That’s what NIGHT CALL is all\nabout. It's a radio program that lets people air their views\nman to man. Color to color. Live. From phones anywhere\nin the country.\nAfter all, a syringe full of junk bites into Black and White\nskin with the same ruining surge. And a Black mother cries\nover her child just like a White one does. The problems\nare pretty much the same; just the characters have different\ncolors."
