  "text": "than those so far mentioned, a problem in¬\nextricably linked with all the others.\nThe real challenge, 1 am convinced, lies in the\nneed for a massive upgrading in the quality of\neducation.\nBy this, I mean:\n1. A higher level of instruction and\nmethods.\n2. A higher level of instructors.\n3. A greater attention to the individual\nstudent.\n4. The fullest development of the human\npotential.\nThe challenge is all the more compelling in\nview of the quickening tempo of technology,\nthe growing complexity of our social organiza¬\ntion, and the mounting menace of Com¬\nmunism.\nTo meet the challenge will require new\nideas, new approaches, and a new willingness\nto experiment and innovate. Many of the\nmethods and tools for bringing about an im¬\nmediate upgrading of quality are at hand.\nBut we have made only the barest start on\nlearning how to use them. In this area, I be¬\nlieve that the experience of American business\nand industry suggests a constructive approach.\nIII. IMPORTANCE OF NEW METHODS\nLet me say, at the outset, I am fully aware\nthat anyone who attempts to apply to educa¬\ntion certain concepts from business and indus¬\ntry is automatically suspect.\nHe is as wide open to criticism as the alleged\nteacher here in the Detroit area who placed an\nad in one of the local newspapers. The ad\nread: “If you are not satisfied with your\nchild’s progress in school, why not have he or\nshe tutored by an experienced teacher.”\n3"
