I think\nwe will be pleasantly surprised how many educational broadcasters\nfit this more pleasant mold*\nNow to the abstracts:\nlo American University - WA'UT and Roger Penn* This is the\n2nd year of she1r drban Broadensting Workshop, a University-Industry\nProject* Most of you have seen the brochure* With the help of\nschool counselors, NAACP, Urban League, eto^ high school Juniors\nof oromise are selected from schools in center city ( ashington)\nand provided a tuition-free, intensive, one-month summer workshop*\nFree lunch is provided and when more money can be found* carfare will\nbe paid too* Most of these students (about 17 each year) have had no\nexposure to, or thought of, broadcasting as a career* In this second\nyear some of the first year \"graduates\" have been nicked up on work-\nstudy programs, scholarships, etc*, and probably 10 of them,$t least,\nwill enter college, several in broadcasting majors* Roger Penn will\nassist any university or station which wants to try this successful\nformulaFinancing is by donations from commercial broadcasters*(We\nwould hone that educational broadcasters would help too* The amount:\nIs small and should be a natural for foundation support)"
