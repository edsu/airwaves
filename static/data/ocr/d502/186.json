I have a hunch that when Mr. Skillman returns from\nAtlantic City, he will feel differently* I think his last paragraph indicated that.\nToo bad I didn’t know about it the other day when I met Petrillo at the Council\nmeeting* If it weren*t that they are holding their convention now, I would have\ntalked to him, or same of his top people#\nSincerely,\nM* S* Novik\nMr* Ralph Steetle\nExecutive Director, JCET\n1785 Massachusetts Ave„, NW\nWashington 6, D* C*\nEnel, copy letter to Nighbert"
