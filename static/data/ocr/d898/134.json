If Britain with more\nlimited public resources can sustain four different\nnational program services surely the United States\ncan sustain more than one public radio system if the\nneed can be demonstrated as we believe it can. We\ndo not want to foreclose .the options for other types\nof program services from other stations or networks.\nWe propose here one model for a national public radio\nsystem which we believe would be useful and important\nto test.\nIll The Program Service\nThe planning group felt that the exact nature of\nthe program service necessarily must be determined by\nthe staff of the system in the first instance with\nthe key stations as advisors.\nHowever, there was general agreement on the\nfollowing principles or objectives:\n1) Program Content: As stated earlier the\nemphasis would be on analysis and commentary regarding\ninternational and national issues and events,supplemented\nby good talk presentations, performances, actualities such\nas hearings, U.N. sessions, and key meetings across the\nworld, and experimental productions in sound and drama.\nThe purpose of the model system would be to develop new\nradio personalities, producing and creative talent as\nwell as to develop and present programming in keeping with\ncontemporary interests, changing tastes, and needs.\n2) Source of Production: The international resources\nof the new radio combine of the BBC, CBC and ABC\n(Australia) would be used. We would hope that, as this\npublic radio system grew, it would become associated with\nthis new combine, which is presently in search of an\nAmerican partner. This would fill an important need for\nthe combine and assure serious American participation in\nthe world's first English language network - a participation\nof substantial significance to the U. S."
