I rubbed my finger over the printing\nand found it to be quality. Everything seems to be in\napple pie order. As far as I am concerned, you might\ntouch the horses with the tip of the whip and get the buggy\nrolling.\nFor the past several months I have been in contact with\nRepresentative Colrner of Mississippi and have been pressing\nhim to take a stand in our behalf on the Rules Committee\nof which he is a member. I have brought considerable\npressure to this part of the country to bear upon him and\nfeel that during the next session we may be able to change\nhis vote. Please know that my services are at your com¬\nmand in this common cause we are representing.\nWith kindest personal regards, I am\nSincerely yours,\nRaymond D.
