C.\nDear John:\nThanks for your follow-up and attention to the consideration of William\nG. Harley as a potential member of the Washington Rotary Club. You\nhave referred the question to your classification committee. In that\nconnection, may I suggest that his classification might be the same\nas mine has been? namely, “Educational Television.\" This particular\ncategory is so new that it has not had time to be itemized in the classi¬\nfication book. However, educational television is becoming so im¬\nportant in the total broadcasting picture that it fully deserves such a\nclassification. R.I. had no objection when such a classification was\nestablished in my behalf.\nThank you again for your attention in this matter.\nSincerely yours,\nRDH/ml\nRaymond D. Hurlbert\nPast District Governor"
