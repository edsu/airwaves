  "text": "WHA«TV<=\n•18-\nSuggestions:\nI would like to see a somewhat shorter day* since I left with an exhausted feeling\nafter the 8:00 AM to 9:30 plus, sessions* The term, \"workshop,1' was overrating what\nactually happened? If the seme format is to he used in the future, the tern \"confer®\nance,\" might be more applicable„ I believe that if personnel attending future \"work®\nshops\" are of the same level of operational experience that in many cases, the work¬\nshop technique would be of more use* The only place that I could see this technique\nused at this yearns workshop, was the method used for only one demonsl,ration—that\nof Kine® recorder ope ration? If one were to have a four unit demonstration with the\nparticipants split into four groups, on an experience level basis, with much more\nactivity on the individuals part, I believe that the possibility of passing on more\nexperienced \"know-how^ could be achieved* This would put a considerable load on the\nindividual responsible for a demonstration* He would be required to repeat the same\nbasic information to each group, plus trying to give those of different experience\nlevels, the needed advanced material* Beyond that, this method would require at least\nthe number of separate work spaces as there are groups* Perhaps a compromise could\nbe worked out with only two units, on a rotation basis| rather than four units*\nAlthough there was a wealth of material on the operational technique of lighting,\nK±ne®operation, and some on theory of the same, too little was devoted to test pro®\ncedures that would enable one to attain the standards that are hoped for in the\nNAEB* The two people who gave significant contributions to this, were Jack Chenoweth\nand Fred Remley, although some was made by George Howard, from General Electric, with\nhis light meters* More in this line would have been greatly appreciated* It may be\nfelt that this type of information should be a basic requirement for personnel in\nthis field, but many of us have entered via other routes and do not have what I\nwould call a working knowledge of common testing techniques used in the industry*\nThis workshop has given me a much better insight into the film recording business than\nI had before* Greatly appreciated, was the information given by Mr* Kelly, of J* Ac\nMaurer Co«, although it was not of a very technical nature* Never having been ex®\nposed to anything like large scale film processing, the trip to the small processing\nplant was enjoyed* It gave me a better understanding of the standardization of proc®\neasing, as explained by W* H* Smith of Lakeside Laboratory* Paul Ireland*s pertinent\nremarks were also enjoyed*\nA note should be added in appreciation of the excellent talk by Prof* Stasheff, of the\nUniversity of Michigan* His speech was by far, the most tension relieving*\nFrom a humorous aspect and also providing some very useful information to one not fam¬\niliar with microwave technique, was the talk of Alan MacIntyre, of WUNC-TV* It was\nwell backed with factual information by Mr? McLaughlin, of Raytheon*\nThe wealth of other information available through talks and that gathered via the\n\"bull sessions,\" was enlightening, and although I feel that I personally contributed\nlittle to the conference, other than my presence, I hope to see the expansion of the\nworkshop in the future as a method to educate the educators in all phases of the NAEB\nprogram*\nI wish to take ray hat off to Mr* Cecil Bidlack, for a commendable jobs\nArley F, Uhrig\nCopied at NAEB Hqs, ll/23/#~cr"
