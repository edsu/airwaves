Taking you at your word, I will\nlook elsewhere this time, though, I confess, without much\nfaith that I will find another willing and able to give\nas much devotion and energy to the job. I trust you will\nconsent to remain on the committee so that it may continue\nto have the benefit of your experience and ideas.\nAnd believe me, I appreciate your offer to help in other\nways; it is a source of great comfort to know I can count\non you to serve in other capacities.\nFinally, I am glad to confirm my acceptance of your\ninvitation to speak at the Professional Breakfast of the\nNAEB Region II Conference, Saturday, April 22nd.\nWith kindest regards, I am\nSincerely yours.\nWilliam G.
