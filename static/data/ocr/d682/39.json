Newsletters* etc®; the packages were mostly tape\nrecordings® This quantity has been increased an estimated thirty per cent, and\nHeadquarters predicts a continued sharp increase® ^\n3) IN—SCHOOL AND GENERAL PROGRAMMING* Because the problem of satisfactorily hand¬\nling the in-school program project is quite different from that of the week-to-\nweek distribution of general programs, the Network at one time regarded the two\nprojects as quite separate and as running more or less parallel in the same office®\nThis proved quite impractical® Neither project can be regarded simply as something\ndone “over and above” or even “along with” the other—especially since the great\nexpansion of the Network operation® There is only on© Network organization in\none office, and every job must be coordinated with every other and the whole inte¬\ngrated into one project* Since last fall, progress has been made toward such an\nintegration but no perfect system has been developed because of the pressures re¬\nquiring maximum effort to keep on top of daily output* Unlike the general week-\nto-week series, in-school programs are mailed in complete series5 that is, 14 pro¬\ngrams of a series go to a station at one time* Also stations receive an audition\ntape for a series before they definitely order it. During the offering and distri¬\nbution of these in-school programs, the week-to-week distribution must lessen in\nquantity to allow time and tape for this work® Or, to put it positively, between"
