Com.\nIstanbul\nREPORT OF THE MEETING OF DRAMA EXPERTS\nThis report (document O.A. 4248) is now attached to this\nnote \"but in its draft form it had the advantage of advance examination\nby the Bureau of the Committee when it met in January.\nSome points on which the Bureau commented were as follows :\npoint 1 (a) Eurotheatre - The Bureau noted that copies of the 6 plays\nselected by the international jury had been supplied to member or¬\nganizations in many parts of the world but it felt that this infor¬\nmation was insufficient to judge fairly the success or otherwise of\nthe scheme, since no information was available as to whether or not\nthe plays requested had, in fact, been produced. The Administrative\nOffice was asked to seek information on this point and this inquiry\nis currently in progress.

It suggested that the\nCommittee might feel inclined to recommend to the Administrative\nCouncil that an approach be made to the Secretariat of the Prix Italia\nwith the request that recordings of all the winning entries of that\ncompetition be retained by its Secretariat as a permanent archive for"
