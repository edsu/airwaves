Skomia\nPresident\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nFor some reason, I've been a mediocre communicator on matters\nrelating to the McLuhan project (#279). In spite of this, we seem to\nbe in very good agreement on a somewhat nebulous set of topics. Your\nletters of 2/12 and 4/18 indicate a budget reduction and my letter of\n4/14 indicates that this is agreeable. Although there may be some\nfiscal problems, they seem to be minor ones.\nFirst, do you now have a full accounting of the money spent or\nto be spent before the project terminates? If you have these things and\nwill not overspend by more than ten per cent in any of the budget cate¬\ngories (e.g., salaries, services, travel), then the final accounting at\nthis end should be easy to accomplish. To clarify further, our budget\nshows amounts such as $5,500 for travel, $1,400 for supplies-materials,\netc. It will be these individual amounts, plus the total amount which\nwill need to be examined in final accounting.\nSecond, if you can very quickly identify the surplus dollars, if\nany, and return them to our account, we might be able still to use them\nin new funding which is now underway. We gather from the earlier\ncorrespondence that such surplus would not be great and this is there¬\nfore not a critical matter; however, if funds are returned later than\nthe middle of June, they are probably lost to the Title VII program.\nIf there is anything further which we can help to accomplish as\nyou bring the project to its conclusion, please give us a call or a\nquick letter and we will try to be of assistance.\nSincerely yours.\nWarren F. Seibert\nSenior Research Coordinator\nEducational Media Branch"
