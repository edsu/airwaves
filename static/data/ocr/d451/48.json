You x^ill observe that the\ntotal cost estimate for black and white is $57,500...the\ncost estimate for color only $2,500.00 more, or $60,000.00.\nAssuming that we could start on the shooting scripts\nand production without any further delay, we anticipate\nthat the film project could be completed under normal\nschedule conditions by the end of the year.\nWe feel that this is an exciting and much-needed\nproject, one which has been given a great deal of thought\nand care, and we would like to have a part in bringing it\nto completion.\nSincerely,\nEarl J.^Miller\nDirector of Motion Pictures\nEnel.
