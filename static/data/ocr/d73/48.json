What we need is more,\nnot less, talk about the promise of educational\nTV, and about the urgency of using it to solve\nour paramount national problem.\nIt is true that, in human terms, the growth in\neducational television’s first eight years has its\nimpressive aspects. Gifted students in small rural\nschools are taking college preparatory courses;\nclassroom demonstrations are being enriched by\ntreasures from art, science and history museums;\n1"
