S. educational crisis; It then made broad policy\nrecommendations for the realization of that potential. I categorically\ndeny that any member of the panel at any time suggested or supported or\nrecommended any plan for monolithic control of education.\nFinally, l would point out that until recent months the USOE has\nopposed, not supported, H. R. 132 and similar pieces of legislation. \\\ndo concur completely with Mr. Moley's conclusion in re the \"immense\nadvantages of using radio and television in education.\" This academic\nyear in Central Ohio alone 100,000 public school and university students\nare receiving credit instruction from the university television station\nwith all controls at the local and State level.\nH. R. 132 would simply make this same situation possible in more plices\nacross the country.\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hull, Director\nTelecommunications Center,\nOhio State University, and\nChairman of the Board,\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nRBH/anh"
