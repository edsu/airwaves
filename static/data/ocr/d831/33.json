Nor do they seem to have as\nmuch to contribate as the others.\nThe shortness of time in inviting alternates wasn^t good.\nOne reason was that those initially invited didnH reply\n(on trips, wrong address and letter not forwarded etc.).\nAdames invitation for exanple never came back and was\napparently never forwarded ilrom North Carolina, the address\nwe had~fbr him.
