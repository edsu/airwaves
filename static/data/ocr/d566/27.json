  "text": "WhatT s My Name?\nWhen the headouarters arrived in Urbana, considerable\nthought was given to its name. From the records it had been\ncalled a number of things (most of them printable), the most\ncommon one being, \"The National Association of Kducational\nBroadcasters Transcription Network\"* After some discussion,\nit was decided to use NAEB Tape Network. It was easy to say\nand more nearly described the operation than any other possibility,,\nYftiile it would seem highly desirable to have a permanent\nname which everyone will recognize, the present one is not\nconsidered sacred. There are, however, two good reasons for\nkeeping it. First we have used it for several months and\nquite a few people have come to recognize it. Secondly, and\nof far greater importance, we have stationery with the name\nprinted on it together with the plates for printing more.\nA Standard Opening and Closing\nAnother practice which seemed worthwhile was adding to\nall programs a standard opening and closing. The value of a\nrepeated standard identification is obvious. There has been one\ncomplaint concerning the wording of these tags. This is mentioned\nwith the possibility in mind that there may be other objections\nas yet unvoiced. It would be simple to change the wording if an\nagreement can be achieved on what is desired.\nThose currently used are:\nOTENXncT: The following tape recorded program\"1 is an\nexchange feature of the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters.\nCLOSING: The preceding program was tape recorded. This\nis the NAEB Tape Network.\n-15-"
