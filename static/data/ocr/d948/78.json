In two Manitoba music series*\nstudent choruses are used. As for using teachers at the microphone* this would\nbe only in non-dramatic program formats. In a speech or music program, Miss\nMcCance might use a teacher who was particularly expert in the field, who knew\nthe classroom, was a fine teacher, and had a good radio personality and excep¬\ntional delivery. Parenthetically, Miss McCance pointed out that unlike the United\nStates, Canada has few radio courses in high schools, and that few, if any Can¬\nadian universities offer degrees in either radio or speech.\nAmong reminders that her office might give to writers, Miss McCance listed:\nA) Use a small number of characters to avoid confusion in the mind of the\nyoung listeners (and to save expense).\nB) Be careful about the use of sound effects and music, lest they interfere\nwith the informational message, (Supervisors feel free to ask a CBC pro¬\nducer to reduce sound or music if they feel the background is too loud\nto permit easy understanding of the dialogue.)\nC) Be aware of where listening peaks come in a program.\nD) Use colloquial speech, but avoid grammatical errors and the unnecessary\nuse of slang.\nE) Visit classrooms and become acquainted with the maturity level of students\nfor whom the broadcasts are intended.\nReminders given to teachers included:\nA) The necessity for teachers to be acquainted, at the beginning of each\nschool year, with the programs for that year. This is possible through\nthe use of school broadcast manuals provided free of charge by each Depart¬\nment of Education,"
