Under II, item six, I think \"package\" should be\ndefined - same old problem of terminology. I think the\ndecision is between reviewing (1) a \"package\" containing\nall \"this weekâ€™s\" programs from ten different series, or\n(2) a \"package\" containing all 13 programs of one series.\n(The way it stands now the choice seems to be between receiving\n(1) as a grouped package or in individual cartons. - Or\nmaybe the confusion is exclusively mine - I don't know.\nI realize first things come first - but I'd still like\nto see if a questionnaire could be worked out to evaluate\nproductional facilities around the net. \"Do you have a staff\nof writers? Producer - directors? Facilities for producing\ndramatic programs? Live music available\"? etc. I'll also hasten\nto admit that kind of information might be entirely useless\nunless NAEB had \"assignments\" to parcel out.\nHey I Spring's a cornin' ini Saw our first blue water\nunder Mendota's Ice today. C'mon up and have a beer on the\nUnion Terrace, sidewalk cafe style yeti\nCordially,\nRa\nAc 1 Director"
