Capitol\nWashington, D, C.\nDear Mr. Shinkman:\nThis is with reference to the proposed series you offered to the NAEE Radio\nNetwork for consideration.\nAs you may know, all proposed series must be decided upon by NAEB member constituted\ncommitteesi the Program Planning Subcommittee which recommends series for consideration\nby the Acceptance Subcommittee. It was for the Program Planning Subcommittee that\nwe requested an audition tape from you.\nI regret to inform you that after listening to the audition tape and weighing all\nother factors, the Program Planning Subcommittee has recommended that your proposed\nseries not be considered by the Acceptance Subcommittee, the Program Planning SubÂ¬\ncommittee feeling that the type of production you had was not ideally suited for\ngeneral Network use. Accordingly, under separate cover I am returning the audition\ntape you were kind enough to send.\nThank you for thinking of the Network in this connection. Should you have any\nfuture ideas regarding a series, please contact me and I shall gladly see that\nthe proper parties consider your new proposals.\nSincerely,\nRobert E, Underwood, Jr,\nNetwork Manager\nREUjdfc\ncc: Dr. H.
