  "text": "The most successful utilization workshops are based on actual\nobservation of broadcasts being used with a c1ass0 Under the\nmost favorable conditions this is difficult to achieve.\nAs for demonstration material there are a few recorded\nexamples of outstanding classroom broadcasts, but usually\nthere is only one print of a lesson and competition, particu¬\nlarly during the summer, for these Is stiff. Educational\nprogram producers report that hundreds of letters are re¬\nceived each year asking for the use of program examples.\nFrom the users standpoint it Is necessary to write dozens of\nletters to obtain program examples, since there is no one\ncentralized distribution point. In a few locations, where\nutilization procedures are most highly developed, a series\nof program excerpts has been organized to demonstrate specific\npoints. These are not generally available outside of the local\narea. Recognizing that there is a need for materials specif¬\nically organized for courses or meetings dealing with utili¬\nzation, the National Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUtilization Committee decided to investigate the possibilities\nof developing a materials library.\nThe first step was to find out what materials are now in\nexistence, evaluate these materials and find out how they could\nbe made available. ThiS*questlon was explored by the committee\nand a base line survey was planned."
