C. 20036\nDear Mr. Macy:\nThe Board of Directors of National Educational Radio\nat its May 13-14 meeting developed policy positions on\na number of recommendations contained in The Public\nRadio Study.\nIt is the sense of the NER Board that initial CPB actions\nrelating to radio have been appropriate. However, the\nBoard feels that the Corporation does not attach the proper\nsense of urgency to radio. The directors believe that\nPublic Radio Study recommendations should be implemented\nas rapidly as possible.\nThe attachment reflects the position of National Educational\nRadio. We look forward to working with you and your staff\nto insure that radio stations and their audiences accrue\nthe benefits of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nEnclosure"
