I made two\nsuggestions to him:\n1* That he try to work through and with management of our\nmember ETV stations around the country re training,\nfunding and possibly exposure of local film workshop\nefforts. He has a list of our stations and will pursue\nthat route.\n2. That he try to attend at least a part of the Convention -\nan experience that could do more than anything else to focus\nwhat our Association is in relation to what he wants to do*"
