I am looking forward to this meeting since I\nfeel there are a lot of decisions needing committee\naction.\nThis situation with the Chicago school people is getting\nvery complicated. Let me just review it for your infor¬\nmation. After a long delay I did get a letter from Dr.\nWillis telling me they would go along with the project.\nOn March lirth I got a note from George wanting to know\nexactly what we wanted. On March 17th I sent him a three\npage letter outlining our thoughts about the utilization\nkits and suggesting we get together for a meeting to talk\nabout the kit in his office Friday, April 1st. I suggested\nthat Liz Marshall and Wanda Mitchell, two of the committee\nmembers in the Chicago area, join us for this discussion.\nI didn’t hear anything in response to this letter until\nMarch 31st when George called to see if I was coming in\nthe next day for a conference. I told him that since I\nhad not heard from him, I had not planned on a Chicago\ntrip. In our conversation we agreed that he and Elizabeth\nwould go ahead with the preparation of a set of slides for\nthe utilization meeting in Columbus. He talked as though\nhe and Liz had discussed the situation thoroughly and that\nshe would be working on the kit and would, in all likelihood,\nbe the person coming to Columbus.\nNeil Sherburne\nLoring M. Staples\nHarold E. Wood"
