The\nCommittee also feels that, though each Committee of the NAEB should\nbe free to cariy out its own surveys and other investigations, some\ncentral coordination is needed and some central repository of research\nmaterials. This would avoid needless duplication and wasted funds and\nprobably insure better results from these investigations. The Research\nCommittee again has indicated a willingness to assist any of the other\nCommittees or members in the NAEB with their research problems.\nRespectfully submitted\nNAEB RESEARCH COMMITTEE\nRaymond Cheydleur\nKenneth Harwood\nHideya Kumata\nIrving R. Merrill\nPercy Tannenbaum\nI. Keith Tyler\nSamuel Becker, Chairman\nCopied at NAEB Headquarters 10/3/Â£8\ncmc"
