Rider\n14 Gregory Hall\nDear Mr. Rider:\nI have discussed with Mr. Stone your plan for depositing\nthe collection of recordings in the Library and have gone over\nwith him the space available. We believe it will be possible\nfor us to take over the collection of four or five hundred\nrecordings which you now have on hand or expect to receive\nin the near future, and to shelve the recordings alongside\nthose we have received from WILL. I understand that funds\nare available for the purchase of a c binet for the records.\nI hope it will be possible for us to continue this\narrangement on a more or less permanent basis, but any decision\non this point should probably be deferred until our space\nproblems can be worked out. For that reason we may want to\nre-examine the matter after a year or two to see whether any\nchanges are desirable.\nSincerely yours,\n(Signed-R. B. Downs)\nR. Bâ€ž Downs,\nDirector\nRBB/t\ncc: Mr. C. Walter Stone"
