These food material are mostly\nsearches and sugars. Plants whose roots form part of our food supply include\nsweet potatoes, beets, carrots, radishes, parsnips, and turnips.\n1. Develop plants from roots by planting carrots so that the top of the root is_\njust beneath the soil. After the plant has grown for a time, pull it out and\nnote the changes that have taken place in the root.\n2. Use the iodine test to see whether or not starch is present in such roots as\nradishes, carrots, and parsnips.\nSources:\n1. Kroeber and Wolff - Adventures with_Living_Things\n2.
