I agree with\neverything you say. Jim has voiced objection to an expenditure\nof Kellogg funds to call together either the Board or the\nExecutive Committee. I expect to go to Chicago this weekend in\nConnection with a meeting of the Committee of Five, and I am\nhopeful that a meeting of the Executive Committee at least can\nbe arranged for within the next week or so.\nI am afraid that I differ with you in your nice comment\nabout both Dick and Jim, to the effect that they are doing a\nsuper job. I have been compelled to admit to myself that they\nare doing a very mediocre sort of job, and I am not encouraged.\nIt is good to hear from you again. I had a general feeling\nthat you had been rather cool during the last two months, but\nyour letter certainly was the best New Year’s present I have\nreceived thus far.\nWith all best wishes.\nCordially yours,\nsns/gu\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
