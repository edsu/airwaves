Whatever per¬\ncentages those figures represent, it is still a\nlot of people to relate to, and do something\nconstructive about.\nWe have reached a point now where we must ex¬\ntend our successes, reach out to larger numbers\nof people than we have been reaching. Our greatest\nchallenges lie before us. We must win back to\neducation a substantial percentage of those young\npeople who have grown \"away\" from school, but\nwho may still be reclaimed, if we provide adequate,\nnon-threatening, supportive structures. For those\nothers, those for whom education holds no promise,\nwe must begin the difficult task of helping them\nstructure realistic \"life-goals\" through job skill\ntraining, in other than Job Corps settings, since\nwe cannot serve the entire youth population through\nthat program. We must come to the conscious reali¬\nzation that not all disadvantaged male youth can,\nor should be trained as Automobile Mechanics, or\nRadio/Television Repairmen. Not all disadvantaged\nfemale youth can, or should be trained as File\nClerks, or Typists."
