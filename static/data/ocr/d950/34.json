The third fold is a return post¬\ncard on which these poeple can rate programs. We thought we would\nlet the mailing list grow at random until it reached 2,000 or\n3,000 names and then we would ask Elmo Roper or similar out¬\nfit to construct a proger sample covering all socio-economic\ngroups and so forth.
