The grant is slightly under $10,000 for\nan experiment of six-months duration. I am supposed\nto begin the execution of this project at once, if\nnot so onerX — it was originally intended ty all\nconcerned to begin on July l£. In view cf the\nslight delay I suggest that we take August 1 as\nthe starting point for the bookkeeping.\nYou doubtless have a copy of the memorandum\nand Uidget on which the grant is based. I presume\ndisbursements will be made on vouchers over ny\nsignature directed to your office. If you will\nadvise me of your procedures in this respect I\nshall be glad to commence the operation.\nThis matter has reminded me that I have\nwanted for some time to take out an individual mem¬\nbership in MSB. Gan you advise me of the procedure\nfor doing that?\nSincerely yours.\nMr. H. J. Skornia\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nUrbana, Illinois"
