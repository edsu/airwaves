Tour country too has recently passed through a great\nrevolution; but one which I cannot help feeling has had a very differ®\nent influence on your destiny* You will forgive the strong language,\nbut I cannot help but remark that the course, and indeed the catas¬\ntrophe of the French Revolution have cast a gloom over Republicanism,\nwhich perhaps it may never shake off 5 and which renders it in Europe\nrepulsive and discreditable: at least for the present. But here, sir,\nis the difference between your Revolution and ours. The American Re®\npublic is the natural fruit of the American soil: the spirit of free¬\ndom may be impassioned, it may be factious, but it is neither furious\nnor bloody. The various states which make up our Federation (and as\nyou know I have the honour to be the Governor of one of them), these\nstates, as now organised may be consolidated or dismembered. But a\ndisunion of the American states, whatever might be its political conse¬\nquences, could not destroy or even materially change their mutual com¬\nmercial dependence. Probably, it would not diminish our universal\nattachment to republican institutions. I donBi Blind telling you the\ncountry is already pretty unwieldy. The east and the south are already\njealous of each other; and the west regards both of them with suspicion.\nBut the strong bonds of union are there, and will remain there: there\nis a common language; there are common laws; there are common political\nattachments; and finally and above all, there is the great reciprocal\nbond of common interest. Remember this always gentlemen: we live on\ntrade, we live by trade, we live for trade. Trade is our life; and I\ntell you frankly, we all regard the carrying on of trade as something\nto which a man may honourably devote his whole life.\nA LONGISH BRIDGE e WITH PATRIOTIC XM3ERT0MES TO TAKE US AWAY FROM TEE\nGOVERNOR AND OPT ON TO THE STREET."
