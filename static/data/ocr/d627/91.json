At that, the estimate is on the\nliberal side.\nAs soon as I finish this letter I*nr taking off for\na two-week tour of duty with the Army in Washington. I\ncan be reached during this time in the Troop Radio - Tele¬\nvision Branch, Office of the Chief of Information, Depart¬\nment of the Army, Washington 25>, D. C. I will return to the\nTwin Cities around the iith of July. I have put a note on\nmy calendar to get a report off to you at once. If things\nget dull in Washington, I will work on it during the next\ntwo weeks. It shouldn’t take too long.\nAs for the billing, if you will drop me a note as to\nhow much consultation services to include on the bill, I\nwill get this off to you as soon as I get back in the Twin\nCities. I would appreciate some suggestion as to how this\nitem might be written up.\nWhile I am in Washington, I will try to get into the\nEducation Office to talk with some of the \"brain trust\".\nPerhaps by that time they will be talking about a contract.\nI am sorry that I could not send you the report before\nI left but we have been practically losing our minds trying\nto arrange for the prodiction of 390 thirty-minute college\nlessons between July 18 and August 26.\nJohn W.
