Since\nthe Senate has passed similar legislation twice before, the\nHouse vote is perhaps the most crucial test for this legisla¬\ntion.\nIt is therefore important that the Representatives be weli\ninformed concerning the role of this legislation in the future\nof ETV. This information may come from you, personally, or\nfrom whatever source you feel might be helpful in this\nregard.\nEducational organisations which enjoy federal tax exemption\nof course must realize that actions to foster federal legisla¬\ntion must be insubstantial in comparison to other activities.\nSincerely yours.\nHartford N. Gunn, Jr.\nRegion I - TV Board\nNational Association, of\nEducational Broadcasters\nHNGjrjeh"
