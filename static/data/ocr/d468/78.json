We felt the other day they were almost\nmaintaining a sort of competition in morals.\nWell, if you thought that, you were wrong.\n(SOTTO) I feared as much.\nYou9d be shocked at some of the tilings that go on. Why, I was in\nwhat they call a revival meeting right here in the State of New\nYork. Forty days and forty nights; relays of ministers kept it\ngoing.\nSomewhat unusual, but very devout.\nNot at all unusual; and not so devout. Some of the young fellows;\nwell, every so often I*d see one of them go over to a lady, and take\nher by the hand, and squeeze it, and ga2Â© into her eyes, A friend\nof mine wen there: married lady: fine figure of a woman. Only\naccompanied .by her two daughters 0 No husband or brother with them.\nOne of the preachers got so attracted by her, that he reached under\nher bonnet, and tried to... well, I suppose he9d call it * salute\nher with a holy kiss.,! Well, I saw it, and I rose up to proclaim\nthe offonoe and resent it on the spot,\nI suppose the man wan put out at once.\n: Nothing of the kind. The lady stopped me taking any action. Said\nit might have broken up the meeting, and brought on a scandal on\nrevivals generally, whereas it was merely the offence of one man.\nWhat a shocking story. Indeed, we have several times heard that\nthese meetings are often conducted with scandalous displays of\npublic emotion."
