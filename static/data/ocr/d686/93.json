Nobody can say that out of that\nkind of entertainment you're going to get people who can distinguish between good\ntaste and bad taste ... between a high level of culture and a low level of culture ...\nbetween a good idea and a dangerous idea.\nNow, in the light of the unquestioned failure of our broadcasting industry to\nmeet this challenge, must we say there is no hope? Does this mean it is too late\nto correct the situation?\nFortunately, there are recent signs of intellectual stirring, which hold forth\nsome hope for the correction of that great imbalance between entertainment and ideas.\nThere is still some hope in the battle of information versus visceral excitation on\nthe airwaves of the United States.\nIn July of I9I19, twenty-two of the nationâ€™s leading educational broadcasters\nmet together at the University of Illinois, by invitation of the Rockefeller Foundation\nand the Institute for Communications Research. Represented were such institutions and\nagencies as the University of Chicago, Ohio State University, Lowell Institute in Boston,\nthe Rational Association of Educational Broadcasters and the United States Office of\nEducation."
