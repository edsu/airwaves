(You can’t simply stuff such corrections into people*\nIt is necessary to devise a means of discovery and self-enlightenment/\nbut a means that can be used in the present classroom. A prelimin¬\nary type of text is indicated •\nI have, therefore, appended some further notes with specific\nreference to Sam Becker1s observations. Especially his concern\nlest too much is being promised, and lest it prove impossible to p\nprovide a text and do research on the media at the same time.\nAgain, his question *at what level the text would be aimed ?nY '\nNow,I want to avoid controversial issues and work on ground\nthat is acceptable to us all at this stage. But Sam Becker*s\nproblem overlooks many electronic features. Teaching and learning\nare no longer separate functions, at least as they typically were\nand still are under print conditions. Consumer becomes producer.\nFor example. If children are allowed to use a tape-recorder to\nmake their own recording of their own reading of\"John Gilpin*s Ride?\nthey soon learn a great deal about pace, i ntonation, and interpre¬\ntation of the poem. They can erase over and over and try different\nsound effects. They teach themselves the poem via the sound\nmedium in a way that no classroom can teach it.\nIn the same way ETV can take the numerous textual versions and\nvariants revealing XXXXXXXXX the growth of a poem or the creative\nprocess Itself. No classroom or printed text can do this. It\nIs obvious that the new media in education are going to do,not the\nold jobs, but jobs that couiid’nt have been tackled or conceived\nof without the new media. So apropos of Sam’s dichotomy^ between"
