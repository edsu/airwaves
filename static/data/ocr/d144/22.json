Corwell\nDearborn Public Schools\nOffice of Public Relations\n5757 Neckel Avenue\nDearborn, Michigan\nDear Marion:\nI had a letter from Frances Butler of the American\nAssociation of University Women, saying that she has\ndecided to resign from the Public Relations Committee.\nShe said that she never had been active and furthermore\nthe AAUW was giving up its Department of Mass Media.\nI cannot lay my hands on the letter in which you\nrecommended some additions to your Committee, so let me\nknow your choice of a replacement and I will make the\nappointment.\nI also enclose a copy of a brochure put out by the\nASAE. Perhaps we should be turning out something of\nthis nature as a promotional piece for the membership\nrecruitment. Your Committee could work closely with the\nMembership Committee in developing such a brochure. It\nneed not be quite so fancy but still ought to be attracÂ¬\ntive. What do you think?\nWGH: jms\nEnclosure\nP, S. We have lots of letters from which we could extract\nquotes on the value of the organization."
