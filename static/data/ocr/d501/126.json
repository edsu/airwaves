Kenneth Wright\nDirector of Broadcasting\nBox 8U50\nThe University of Tennessee\nKnoxville, Tennessee\nDear Kent\nAs you know, we had one paragraph left over from\nyour Radio Report which we mailed out with the July\nNewsletter* I just want to remind you that the deadÂ¬\nline for the August issue is July 20*\nI am reminding you now because I am leaving\ntomorrow for three weeks. We can use the one paragraph\nleft over and another paragraph idea to make up the\nAugust report. Incidentally, I am anxious we keep these\nreports to one page, although we are willing to run on\nthe second page if and when we have to. Actually, one\ngood idea a month will make the reports worthwhile.\nKind personal regards.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Sehooley\n^resident\nFES:cu"
