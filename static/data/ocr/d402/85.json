  "text": "One final word—I sometimes wonder if in all this discussion about the critical shortage\nof trained manpower there is not too much emphasis on its physical needs of the country.\nWe seem to be worried about so many qualified students nor going on to college only\nbecause it means so fewer trained engineers and technicians for industry or for national\ndefense. Too often our discussion is in terms of fear. Far be it from me to despise\nsuch motivation. Of course we must look to the physical nedds of our country* and to national\ndefense. But this is not enough.Have we no higher motivation than Soviet Russia? No\ndeeper reason for our anxiety? The Russians are logical. Man is made for the state. If\nthe state needs more men all it has to do is to assign them to such training. That is not\nour way of life. It seems to me that our deepest concern should be based on our\nknowledge that so many young men and women are—for what reason it may be—nor developing\ntheir God«*given powers of intellect and free-will. And because there powers are now being\ndeveloped they themselves suffer* our economy suffers* our national defense is\nendangered. In other words—if we are deeply concerned about giving every young man\nand women an opportunity to develop and train the powers that God have given them—our\nmotivation will be deeper* more human* more universal. And when we look to good of man\nas man—other goods for which we strive* the gooc of our economic life* the good of\nnational defense* will best be cared for. Western civilization is based on more than\nthe material; it is based on spiritual values. Unless our motivation is in accord with\nthe spiritual we shall never rise above the material. Higher education needs a larger\nsupply of qualified students for the very simple and very basic reason that human\ndigniity ' demands that development that can come only with education."
