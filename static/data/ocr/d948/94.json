  "text": "28\nAt the conclusion of the discussion of formats and program types, two sub¬\njects of general interest were discussed. One was the problem of determining the\ngrade level best suited for the reception of a given series, or for the considera¬\ntion of a given topic or subject about which a series was to be constructed. The\nsecond was a suggestion by a member of the Seminar that the frequently superior\nproduction facilities and talent resources of university stations might be com¬\nbined with the script and content expertness of school systems. As a result of\nthis discussion, the Seminar unanimously voted to have the following statement\nincluded in this report:\n\"The members of the 195>U NAEB Radio Writers* Seminar recommend that school-\nowned stations and university-owned stations further explore the means of coopera¬\nting in the production of in-school radio programs. We are specifically concerned\nwith the prospect of using university talent and studio facilities for the produc¬\ntion and taping of scripts provided by the school-owned stations in their own\nareas.\"\nAnd with the passing of this resolution, the Seminar was adjourned. Friday\nevening was very pleasantly devoted to a farewell dinner and a group visit to the\nSt. Louis Municipal Opera."
