As\nall Tokyoites know, the price of land in Ginza is fabulously\nhigh and, in earlier times, people would say that one ”sho\"\n(about 2 liters) of land was worth one \"sho\" of money--the\nJapanese equivalent of the Western expression \"worth its\nweight in gold.”\nIt is natural, therefore, that buildings should cover every\navailable lot and they should be standing wall to wall.\nThese tightly packed buildings are deserted when day gives\nway to night on the Ginza.\n„INTROD!)

Three thousand entrants\nfrom Japan5 and 20 entrants from foreign countries occupy\n1600 exhibition booths.\nThe current fair is given added significance this year by\nthe fact that the city of Osaka is now a member of the\nInternational Union of Fairs. This is Japan's first interr\nnational trade exhibition since the country acquired re¬\npresentation in the Paris organization. UFI, by the way,\nis made up of 30 permanent trade fairs representing 16\nnations.\nAt this time, I'd like to quote the address of John\nSnedaker, President of the American Chamber of Commerce\nin Japan. Mr. Snedaker's address is entitled: \"Progress\nto Plenty—the Aim of this Fair.\" In fact, this is the\nofficial theme over the American pavillion, written large\nover the entrance: PROGRESS TO PLENTY.\n-6-"
