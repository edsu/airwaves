Since we will not be able to attach things to the\nwalls, it would help if clippings etc. could be mounted on cardboard easels\nthat can be stood up on a table.\nI am looking forward to seeing you and learning about what you have\nbeen doing.\nSincerely,\n/s/ W. W. Smith\nW. W. Smith\nProfessor W. W. Smith\nElectrical Engineering Department\nUniversity of Massachusetts\nAmherst, Massachusetts (Note: If you are writing to Professor Zaitz and wish\nto enclose this, he will relay it to me.)\nI do not plan to bring any displays ( )\nI plan to bring some display material and estimate that _ square\nfeet of table space will be needed.\n(A brief description of the type of displays would help.)\nSigned.\nInstitution or Call Letters."
