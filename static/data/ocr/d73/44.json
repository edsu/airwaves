Burns\nPresident\nRadio Corporation of America\n30 Rockefeller Plaza\nNew York 20, New York\nDear Mr. Burns:\nI am sure Doctor Tyler has already written you on\nbehalf of the Institute for Education by Radio-\nTelevision, but I want to add to this thank you\nthe gratitude of the Association for your stirring\naddress at our NAEB luncheon.\nAs the Chairman of our Board, Richard Hull, so\naptly said, this was unquestionably one of the\nthree best speeches ever given in the 31 years\nof the Institute's history. I aa sure you felt\nthe warm response and eager Interest of the audi¬\nence. Their rapt attention and enthusiastic\napplause provided some indication of how impressed\nthey were with your vision of what ETY might be¬\ncome if we are bold enough to expand our thinking\nand vigorous enough to effect its optimum devel¬\nopment.\nMany people told me that our NAEB luncheon, high¬\nlighted by your speech, was the outstanding\noffering in the whole Institute. To use a lovely\nphrase of Erica Mann's - I could not disagree\nwith them less.\nWe of NAEB are not only grateful for your magnifi¬\ncent contribution to our program, but especially\nfor the challenge and stimulus you have given us"
