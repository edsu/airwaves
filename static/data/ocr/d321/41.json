Burrows, Manager\nWHOM\nadministration Building\nUniversity of Michigan\nAm Arbor, Michigan\nDear Eds\nTon111 recall that I mentioned to you at\nthe IERT that I hoped the 0rant-in-lid committoo\ncould come up with some recommendations about the\nfuture Grant-in-*id programs*\nVo need some thought liven to such items ass\n— Possible outside sources of financing.\n— Devision of rules - with thought given to\nwhether or not we should require all the clearances\nwe now do, etc.\n— Basic thought given to whether or not the pro¬\ngram is even any good as presently constituted.\n— Should procedures be revised?\n— Should different rules be established, and\nperhaps a separate system of grants, foriin-school\nprograms?\n4nd many other questions. I’m sure all of the\nmembers of the committee have ideas and suggestions,\nand I do think we need to give some serious thought\nto this problem, the grants can well be one of the\nmost Important constributions the NAEB makes to\neducational radio programming, and yet at the moment\nwe don’t have enough money to do the job as we would"
