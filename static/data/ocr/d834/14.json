Illinois\nDear Harry:\nIn answer to your letter of May 12th in connection with the problem\nof labor relations and Morris Novik’s fulfillment of his assignments, nay\n1 go on record as saying that 1 can see nc reason why he would have to duck\nsomething like the Washington conference which hardy' arxa^ed,\nAs 1 said at Columbus, we will either have to face up to the labor\nrelationship problem or Ignore it completely* Apparently wo have established\na position and recognise the problem and situation. This means we are coaan-tted\nand should be represented through the services of Novik under the terms whien\nwere spelled out as far as the association is concerned. To this means\nno national policy or negotiation but a general awareness and function with\nspecific assistance given in Individual situations wherever and whenever re¬\nquired\n1 think wo all are pretty much aware of what is Involved and to vbat\nextant we are committed.\nSincerely r<\nArmand X>- Hunter"
