  "text": "December 13, 1958\nDr. Skarnia: Mr. Hill called from Chicago at 10:00 AM with his rambling\nnotes on Marshall McLuhan’s proposal. He said he was going to write\nthem and send them to you but thought you would have them faster if he\ncalled and gave them to me over the phone. If you want to reach him\nanytime today he will be in Chicago. The number is Lincoln 9-7727. He\nleaves for Washington in the morning. DEC\nHEHRAMBLING NOTES ON MCLUHAN PROPOSAL.\n-Too much emphasis on print, does not fit Hill-Elliott.\n-Don’t believe he should be tied in with our research.\n- Clearing house notes as he suggests in footnote to his letter—that\nwould just clutter and confuse.\nIH The following are in reference to Sections of his proposal;\nI - Old? This probably refers to print and is something beyond the scope\nof the bill.\nII - \"Technological movement of information around the globe\" - doubt if\nthis is world’s biggest industry. His definition of the problem is a little\nhazy and won’t be clearly understood, I fear. Still more reference to\nprint.\nIII - Impression might be that this would result in \"how to\" book - how\nto read, listen, view. Doubt this would receive very favorable reaction.\nVI - Should be his abilities and background - just as we attempted to show\nhow we are equipped (and preferably best equipped) to do the particular\nprojects we proposed.\nAs I mentioned when we talked about this before, we need to know how\nTV and radio act upon children. Then we'll know more about what to do with\nTV and ksk* radio.\nSpiegel’s talk came closer to this than anything McLuhan has said;\nalthough it’s true that Spiegel talked mainly about content, he did touch\non the medium itself, and that's what we need — what does TV per se (and\nthis would apply also to radio) do to the viewer, regardless of the program\ncontent. In other words, what does the act of viewing (the environment,\nintergroup and interpersonal relations) actually do - how does it differ\nfrom the reactions we have while reading—again without regard to content—\nand here if tied in this way (and maybe that’s what he’s saying), it would\nbe logical to tied in with reading.\nHow can we properly determine (no matter how extensive the research)\nwhat kinds of programs we should broadcast, etc., if we do not understand\nthe effects of the medium itself."
