This is true in almost\nall subject areas and especially in the sciences. Science is\nconstantly changing as new phenomena are observed and dis¬\ncovered, but it is characterized by having a few basic generali¬\nzations which compose the structure of science. These generali¬\nzations do not exist as isolated vertical threads within a single\narea of science. They are horizontal generalizations which\nextend across all scientific endeavor.\nThe system of using generalizations to teach broad concepts\nhas implications for you, for the television teacher, and for your\nstudents in the following ways:\n1. It will provide the basic approach toward the under¬\nstanding of science that the television teacher will\nfollow in the presentation of the televised lesson.\n2. It will provide you with some insight into the basic\napproach that will be used by the television teacher."
