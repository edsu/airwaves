In recent decades the arrival of several new media\nhas led to prodigious experimentation in the arts. But, at\npresent, the artists have yielded to the media themselves.\nExperimentation has passed from the control of the private artist\nto the groups in charge of the new technologies*\nThat Is to say, that whereas In the past the individual\nartist, manipulating private and inexpensive materials, was able\nto shape models of new experience years ahead of the public,\nto-day the artist works with expensive public technology, and\nartist and public merge In a single experience. The new media\nneed the best artist talent and can pay for It. But the artist\ncan no longer provide years of advance awareness of developments\nin the patterns of human experience which will Inevitably emerge\nfrom new technological development.\nThe painters of the fifteenth century explained perspec¬\ntive or fixed point of view to the public when print was scarcely\nknown. Aretlno became ”the scourge of princes” when print was\nyoung, and long before the newspaper took up its inevitable\nrepublican role. Petrarch developed the Sonnet as a mode of self-\nexpression and of self-analysis before print and long before\nMontaigne revealed the artistic meaning of the printed page In his\nEssays."
