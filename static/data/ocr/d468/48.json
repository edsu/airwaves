I usually find this kind of affdr\npretty dull myself.\nIt is a social affair, and it has its social interests.\nI sea what you mean. Tour friend, Mr, Beaumont, seems to be .rijoy¬\ning himself.\nYes: he is already an admirer of American ladies. So indeei am I.\nWe find them very fresh and natural.\nYou will also find them, sir, veay moral.\nOf that I am sure.\nYou had batter be very sure. Our ladies have very fre* and open man-\nnersi} but their standard of morality is high: very hr:gh| extremely\nhigh. Exceedingly high. Excessively high.\nI assure you, sir, neither I nor sy friend will e'er have any occasion\nto test the truth of your assertion, which indeei I see proved to me\non every side.\nGood. Saves misunderstandingsi and one of the drawbacks of American\nsociety is 'that it has a short way with mi/understanding.\nOne of the drawbacks? Are there others, »*$r.

What is the reason?"
