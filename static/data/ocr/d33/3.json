You’ll find a report on the Kellogg Project, prepared by\nthe Executive Director. You’ll find a financial report 6£ the\nNAEB treasury, prepared by the Treasurer, and accepted by the Board.\nAdditionally, you’ll find a special condensed version of FAE funds,\nbalances of which are listed in the liabilities under restricted\naccounts. Members should note that these reports on funds are for\nmore than a one-year basis in many cases. The report gives you (as well\nas the FAE and ETRC) an up-to-date accounting of all funds from either\nFAE or the Educational Television and Radio Center.\nIt should be noted that funds given to the NAEB under\ncertain conditions may be used only for such designated purposes.\nThat’s why they are listed as restricted funds in the balance sheet.\nAlso, the Board of Directors is proceeding on the basis\nof the directive of the National Convention at Norman. It is hoped\nto have all financial reports on a fiscal year basis by July 1.\nThe treasurer points out that dues are now billed on a\ncalendar year basis. You will receive your bill for 1954 shortly.\nThe membership should perhaps consider the advisability of changing\ndues to a fiscal year basis, too.\nCordially,\nHarry Skornia\nExecutive Director\nFrank E. Schooley\nNAEB Treasurer\nEnel."
