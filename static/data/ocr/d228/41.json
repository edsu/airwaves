The Association of State Colleges and Universities, composed of 158\npublic institutions of higher education, requested that its concurrence in the views\nexpressed be made known to the subcommittee.\nThe statement follows:\nThe American Council on Education is a council of national educational associa¬\ntions and organizations and of approved institutions of higher education including\nuniversities, colleges, and junior colleges. Its present membership includes 145\nnational and regional educational associations and more than 1,000 educational\ninstitutions.

In accepting teachers awarded scholarships for a year's full-time study.\n3. In designing and carrying out projects to improve the quality of an insti¬\ntution's own program of teacher education.\nHR 10145 has not been reviewed by the Council's Commission on Federal Relations\nand it is not possible for us, therefore, at this time to endorse the Administra¬\ntion's proposals as such. It is clear, however, that the proposals are directed\ntoward the repair of serious deficiencies in our educational system and that the\nproposal is worthy of the most serious consideration by the Congress.\nThose provisions of HR 10145 that would affect the relationship of higher\neducational institutions to the Federal Government appear to be consistent with\nthe policies governing such relationships advocated by the Council's Commission\non Federal Relations. As presently drawn, HR 10145 would enable colleges and\nuniversities to render effective assistance in developing better programs for the\ntraining of school teachers, leading to an improvement of the quality of"
