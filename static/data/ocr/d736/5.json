In assisting publish¬\ning programs in Asia, the Foundation subscribes\nto the Asian belief that these programs help gen¬\nerate the exchange of ideas and experiences\nwithin Asia.\n(^>IVIC organizations, whose activities lead to\ngreater citizen participation in programs bene¬\nfiting their communities, constitute another field\nof Foundation interest. The Seeds for Democ¬\nracy project is an example.\nThe Foundation (then the Committee for\nFree Asia) assisted initially by coordinating\nthe collection of vegetable seeds by American\ncivic organizations and individuals for distribu¬\ntion to farmers in the Philippines by a few Fili¬\npino groups. The flow of seeds became so great\nthat more volunteers were needed to handle the\ndistribution. Consequently, a Philippine Seeds\nfor Democracy Council was formed. Twelve\nnation-wide Filipino civic and social organiza¬\ntions, most of which had never worked together\npreviously, joined the Council and began to co¬\noperate. Most of them were urban groups which\nhad never before worked together on a rural\naction program. They received local support\nfor their activity through a radio program that\nprovides farmers with vital information on\nfarming techniques, community work centers,\nand the building of fish ponds as a source of\nsupplementary food. A major American busi¬\nness firm undertook to sponsor the radio pro¬\ngram as a public service. The Philippine Air\nLines transports hundreds of thousands of seed\npackages without cost to rural communities."
