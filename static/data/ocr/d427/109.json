You ©ay recall that provision for an Associate Director,\nwith salary for a little over a year and a half was approved as a part of Head-\nquarters8 operation during the past year.\nW@ shall be holding rather intensive meetings both before and at the\nHew York Convention. Following these discussions w® shall present our rec-\namneafi&tioB© explicitly for tbo Washington office and other matters that X\nbriefly went-over with you.
