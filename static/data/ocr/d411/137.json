Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam;\nI am glad to know that you are thinking about the future\nof NAEB research.\nYou ask how much money we may have for research next\nyear. The NAEB request now before the Ford Foundation asks\nfor a very sizeable sum of money for this. So far we haven't\nheard anything, which fact may be related to the unfortunate\ndeath in the Capital Airlines Viscount accident in Michigan\na couple of weeks ago of John K. Weiss, the Foundation's\nliaison person for all radio and television projects.\nWe are doing the best we can to expedite a reply from\nthe Foundation, consistent with the proprieties and also\nwith the inevitable dislocation of the radio and television\ngrant machinery caused by John's death. Until we do hear\nfrom them, though, I am afraid nobody can answer the question\nof how much money we are going to have for research next\nyear. We can, though, say that the amount we asked for was\nconsiderable!\nI doubt if there are any Association funds which could\npay travel for research committee members to the Columbus\nInstitute. However, I see that you sent Harry Skornia a\ncopy of your letter, and therefore he will be answering it\ntoo. He can correct me if I'm wrong.\nYours sincerely\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP:ds\ncc; Harry Skornia\nRichard Hull"
