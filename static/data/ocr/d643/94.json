Paul 1, ttlrmceota\nDear Johns\nI asked for a »iraight-fm%-the-»houldor statement from you,\nand got it, and I appreciate it, Mary thanks. You *m, with\nKTCA-TV the only oonwunity STV station in Region IV, I oonaider\nit a singularly valuable member of *vny flock\" and a* determined\nthat it not merely reuain in the NAK23 ranks, but also beooms an\nactive spoke man for the type of operation it represents,\n>^hile I oan't buy your statement that NA£B la *.,„a Midwestern\nsocial club for radio operators\", let's face iti we have some\nmighty strong neo&mrs, both radio and TV, here in the Hiduert\nand thereby have a responsibility to contribute proportionately•\nI think there's a legitimate distinction between the strong\ninfluence our Midwestern membership represents by virtue of\nnumbers and what you seen to infer is a collusive domination.\nIt siaply ain't sol As for radio vs, TV goals, I don't think\nyou can separate the two, and NAK8 is becoming more and more\nunique in its realistic, bilateral stand, I am sure I needn't\nremind you that your proposals to help put the potential com¬\nmunity ETV stations in motion were first presented at an NASS\nsponsored seminar for STY managers.\nAs for your proposals, it is true they were tabled at the con¬\nvention, tut not indefinitely nor oapriciously. They were\ntabled only because they fit right Into a larger discussion\nwhich had already been set for a special post-convention\nmeeting. It became obvious early in the Board Meeting that\nthere wouldn't be sufficient time during the convention to\nreeolve all the matters on the agenda. Several of the\nweightier onee, including a serious appraisal of our reoord\nwith the oomaunity KTV msrabers, were deliberately deferred\nto this later msetlr^ where they oould be hashed out at length,\nwithout interruption."
