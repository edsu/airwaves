  "text": "1. Tape supply, (See Paragraph 8.)\n2. Master copies. For somewhere in the neighborhood of\n$100 we can adapt either the recording service or school of\nmusic disc machines for microgroove recording. Such recordings\nwould be somewhat cheaper than tapes.\nActually there are some advantages to both kinds of file\nrecordings, so I recommend this as something to be carefully\nconsidered together with a policy on whether or not we are\ngoing to fill all programs or just a selective group.\n3. Technical quality. I am seriously concerned about the\nmechanical quality of our product. I feel that we can not\nexpect continued support unless an acceptable standard is\nestablished and maintained.\nI therefore suggest that we initiate a complete study of\nthis problemâ€”more complete, perhaps, than we have thus far\nconsidered. On the basis of this study we can determine what\nequipment is necessary. We will, then, proceed to acquire this\nequipment as soon as possible. If our funds are insufficient,\nwe must consider a source of money for this purpose. It seems\nto me that the heart of the operation is found in this problem\nand the next one.\n4. Duplicator and distribution. What we are doing now is\ndesparately inadequate. Without vastly expanded duplicating\nfacilities the network can never achieve a smoothly running and\nefficient operation.\nBob Johnston recently talked to Toogood, without reason"
