Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Mr. Powell:\n14 GREGORY HALL\nJRBANA, ILLINOIS\nAugust 19, 1958\nAUG 2 0 1358\nEnclosed is the artist’s rough sketch designed for the NAEB portion of your\nannual report. In explanation of the layout: it was planned for a page sim¬\nilar to one from your 1953-1954 report, as far as page size, margins, and\ntwo-tone color. (As I mentioned in my letter yesterday, the colored portion\nmay be a gray tone if this would best answer yoir needs.)\nIn considering caption-labels for the sketches, may I suggest the following:\nNAEB RADIO. . .\nsatisfies the individual taste\nenriches the school curriculum\ncontributes to the child’s intellectual growth\nenlightens and entertains the family\nstimulates adult discussion groups\n(The last two are in reverse order.) Please advise us on your printing require¬\nments, whether we should have the captions set here and submitted with the\nlayout, or whether you will include the captions after we send you the final\nartwork. Please feel free, too, to us£ your own ideas for captions, if_ you\ndo want to use them.\nWe would like to make one suggestion to the artist before he reworks this in\nfinal form, and that is to include more people in the sketch of the adult group\nof listeners. If you have further suggestions on the sketches or on the order\nin which they appear, please let us know.\nWith this information (on layout size and color, printing requirements for any\ncaptions, and suggestions on the final form) I believe we will be able to pro¬\nceed without further difficulty.\nThank you for your help.\nSincerely,\nJane Lombard\nEditor"
