As you know, Aerojet-General Corpora¬\ntion is one of the world's largest builders of rockets, rocket engines\nand associated equipment in addition to being a leader in the free\nworld's scientific research and development.\n¥e feel that we have an interesting and informative story to tell\nfrom an educational point of view and we would welcome the opportunity\nto discuss this matter with you further. If you feel that you will be\ninterested in discussing this project, perhaps we can \"get together\"\nat some mutually convenient time. If you will drop me a note with\nyour ideas on the subject, we can plan the general material for the\nseries according to your desires and have an idea of where we stand\nbefore proceeding further.\nThank you for your interest and consideration, I shall anticipate\nhearing from you by return mail.\nSincerely,"
