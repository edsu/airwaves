Novik,\nand Professor David C. Phillips.\nAmong others, the following sample questions were asked by the delegates,\nthrough the Chairman, of specific panel members:\nQuestion: Are there other regions that have as discouraging a picture in TV\nas Region I seems to?\nSkornia: You haven’t ahfr troubles as compared to Region VI, at least as\nthey frequently see them. In the Midwest, the situation is similar to that for\nradio where there is a sound basis at the beginning. Where TV stations grew up in\nthe Midwest there was twenty years of background of radio.\nIn Region I there was rarely radio as a building block to TV. Pittsburgh,\nfor instance did not have a broad radio basis. An educational radio background\nthat is first sound in its own right is an excellent start for TV.\nWarren: The East is more conservative than the West in all educational\nbackground and we’re penalized for it now.\nSnrn th: It might interest you to know that the West spends f>7.50 per capita\nfor their state universities while Massachusetts spends 75 cents per capita.\nSkornia: I’m more amazed about the Midwest each time I come East. There are\nnot so many people, for example, but they spend more money on the whole on public\neducation.\nQuestion: Why isn’t it practical for the Center to set up or develop a\nprocessing plant so stations could buy raw film of uniform quality from the Center\nand return it there for processing uniformly? It would cut costs and at the same\ntime give the Center a chance to look over our films.\nSkornia: The Center, I believe, has decided that it can only serve in a\ncoordinating capacity. They don’t feel they should have operational personnel on"
