Therefore, I am recommending to our\nBoard that our President, Vice-president and Execu¬\ntive Director be named to represent NAEB on an\nexchange basis with whatever three people or officers\nare named by DAVI.\nAction will reach you shortly, I hope, from the\nnational office on my recommendation.\nSincerely yours.\n/s/ Allen Miller\nDirector, Region VI\nChairraan, Organ!sa tiona1\nLiaison Committee\nAMsgb\ncc: Board of Directors HAEB"
