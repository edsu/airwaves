It is\nassumed that not only will these conferences do immeasurable good\ntoward improving the quality of instructional television by raising\nthe competencies of persons engaged in ITV, but that they will also\ndemonstrate that such workshops in the future are worthy of support\nfrom individual and institutional fees.\nIt should be noted that the Urbana conference was not supported\novertly except through the $5 fee paid by all registrants. However,\nthese funds were only adequate to pay for publicity, to publish a\nreport of the proceedings and to defray the cost of certain\nincidentals. In actuality the conference was supported primarily\nby individual speakers and members of the Planning Committee who\ndonated their time, by their institutions which paid their expenses,\nand by the University of Illinois which made no charge for extensive\nuse of facilities and personnel."
