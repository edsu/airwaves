Williamson\n20 Church Street\nGreenwich, Connecticut\nDear Mr. Williamson:\nThanks very much for your letter of February h$ and for the enclosed copy\nof the comments filed with the F.C.C. by the Connecticut Citizen’s Council on\nEducational Television.\nAs far as new chapters for AERT are concerned, we find that there are some\ndiscrepancies in the by-laws of the Association regarding chapter charters and\nmembership fees. Since we do not anticipate being able to clear up these dis¬\ncrepancies until the Board of Directors meets in Columbus, Ohio in April, we are\nattempting to soft pedal the formation of additional chapters at this time.\nPlease understand, however, that we hope ultimately to create many new local\nchapters in the Association since it is obvious that this would be a source of\ngreat strength.\nI am enclosing a list of members and subscribers in AERT as of December 1,\n1955* This may be of assistance to you in making further contacts in your area.\nT am sorry that you did not receive a copy of the Membership Newsletter. I\nam enclosing a copy of the December issue and I will send you a copy of the Jan¬\nuary and February issues as soon as more are made up. Right at the moment, our\nsupply is exhausted.\nI gave your check for $5*00 to Miss Kounas and asked her to renew your mem¬\nbership. She’ll be sending you your membership card in a few days.\nI hope this supplies you with some of the information you need. If there\nis anything else, won’t you please let me know?\nKindest personal regards. K\nSincerely,\nJARsle\nJohn Adams Rourke\nNational Membership Chairman\nAERT"
