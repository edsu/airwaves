Salary ranges are completely out of line\nin at least the first division.\nAverage Salary Salary Range\n1. Colleges and Universities 50.00-2,000.00\n10 watts\n2. Colleges and Universities 5,354.00 2,400.00-6,700.00\n250-5,000 watts, AM and/\nor FM\n3. Public Schools and Boards 3,488.00 2,000.00-4,600.00\nof Education\n4. Other Institutions\nSalaries of Engineers, First License\nMore encouraging is the next table in which salaries\nare given for Engineers with a First License. In almost\nall instances, their salaries are greater than for\nother staff members excluding those paid to Directors\nand Managers. Salaries for engineers with second and\nthird class licenses have not been averaged because of\ninsufficient data in those tiro catagories. In many\ninstances, student help has been used, some of it\nworking without any compensation for their services.\nFor individual station differences concerning student\nengineers, see the appropriate tables in the appendix."
