Wish respect to the meeting I should\nsay that 1 am much less concerned with the auspices and\nthe mechanics of invitations and sponsorship than I am with\nwhat may bo accomplished therefrom. Whether or not the\nmeeting is a success seems to me to depend on whether\nor not the agenda is addressed to fimdamentals more\nwhether specific organisations or indesd even individuals\nparticipate.\nIt was good to have the opportunity to talk with you\nand 1 trust that it will not be so long before we get together\nagain.\nSincerely*\ncc: Burton Paulu\nFrank Schooley\nHenry Cheydeyne\nJames Miles\nHarry Skornia —\nJohn KU Weiss\nEducation Program\ns ntAuy' uARTERS\nMR i G te56\np#\n•jiPill,!^! l|2|8|4|6i«"
