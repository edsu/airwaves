It is this\ntradition - the barn-raising, the box supper, the quilting bee - that 0E0 must\nbuild on.\nWe can help the rural poor. But to do it, we must involve the non-poor,\nmust aim at raising the entire gamut of social resources and services. And\nwe must do it in the closest collaboration with the Federal Departments that\nknow the countryside, the migrants, the Indians. We must continue to raise\nthe levels of understanding of the urban-oriented agencies such as Labor and\nHUD. And we must, through a consistent emphasis on Rural Affairs, help our\nown agency to re-orient its map, its manoeuvres, its total strategy, for the\nattack on rural poverty."
