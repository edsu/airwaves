It is estimated that an additional five to six\nhundred participated in those organized by the March of Dimes,\nThe average size of the groups was twelve persons.\nAn estimated ten thousand persons listened regularly to the radio program,\n(Details on a radio survey appear later in the report.)\nOf the thirty-four groups registered, twenty-three stayed together for the\nentire series, which lasted until the second week in June.\nOrganizing Principle.\nMost of the groups met in private homes, and these ranged from very luxurious\nhouses to very modest ones.\nThree kinds of organizational principles were discovered: (^) natural\n'’friendship” groups; |2) block groups; and (3) groups consisting of people drawn\nfrom the same formal organization (service club, P-TA, churches, etc.)\nOf these, the ’'friendship\" groups were the most successful from these stand¬\npoints: persistence of the group; growth in size; quality of discussion; spontaneity\nof participation; and personal satisfaction expressed by the people involved. A$\nused in this report, \"friendship group” has a broader meaning than referring only to\nan existing group of friends. The term also includes people whom the organizer\nthought would enjoy each other. Usually these groups ripened rapidly into hsting\n\"friendship” groups.\nThe block groups were the least successful. In all cases of those registered,\nthe \"block groups\" disintegrated early. In some cases block groups were converted\nby the organizer into friendship groups. This had the effect of a blood transfusion\nin restoring vitality to the affected group."
