Sulaer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nStation WFI0 (JM)\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Bromot\nI certainly agree that nothing definitive happened at,JR\nconsult tee meeting in Columbus. ..and it was disappointing.\nThe only other thing I can think of to add to the minutes\nist Didn’t that group agree that it was not wise to try the\ndecals?\nI also agree with you that the committee members may he\nsomewhat disappointing—except that I think Tom Petry has\nsome pretty good ideas...but the committee conversation\nsomehow never seemed to get to the point where he could\nadvance any of them. As I recall, he made one feeble\nattempt to try to answer Harold's question of what the\ncommittee would recommend if it had $1,000 to spend next\nyear. Maybe be can do better by letter...and perhaps the\nabsent members would have some ideas, if asked that question,\ntoo.\nIt was good to see you and your wife again, anyway. And I\nwonder whether you went home via the antique shops or the\nrailroad yards.\nBest regards,\n(Mrs.) Betty Mtftenaie\nPublications Editor\nBMC/dp\nccs Harold E. Hill"
