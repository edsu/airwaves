In case billing at your end cannot be handled in this way we\ncan arrange to add to the annual assessment charge* but I believe this should be\ndone only when it absolutely cannot be separately paid.\nYou will therefore be billed on a quarterly basis normally beginning\nwith a billing in October for the months of J ly, August, and September, etc-,\nFor the first bill, however, since billing beginning with July would in effect\nbe retro-active, with Board approval, we shall not make billing for charges\napplicable until beginning with shipments on or after September 1, The first\npostage bill you will receive will be mailed during the month of January, and will\ncover the four-month period from September through December, inclusive. Thereafter,\nyou will be billed on a quarterly basis.\nWe have worked out a form for keeping track of the postage for each ship¬\nment, and have had it in effect, on a test basis, for our own information, in order\nto get the meatonies set up, for the past couple of months, I am sure there will\nbe no difficulties in the mechanics of the procedure,\nThe Board has asked me to convey to the members of the Network their\nat the necessity to take this step, and their hope that all -ember stations\n10 find SO1T50 way ^ handle the payment of this additional expense.\nIt will help to enable the Network to live within its income, and thereby insure\nits continuance,?\n.. ,,, By not starting this billing until after September 1 shipments, some\ntime will be allowed stations for making necessary budgetary and order adjustments\nand a full year will not be involved for this first year0"
