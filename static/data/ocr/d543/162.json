Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nStations WHA\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill,\nHere are a list of participants and a summary of events\nof the recent meeting of Region VI. The wminutesn were made\nfrom my notes and are subject to correction by anyone who\nwas present.\nIt was wonderful to have Harry Skornia with us at the\nmeeting. After most adverse conditions of travel, he did an\nexcellent job of describing the current program and plans of\nNAEB to the members of Region VI who were present. Our only\nfurther wish was that you might have been there.\nFollowing the meeting Glenn Starlin suggested that the\nHASB board might wish to consider whether or not an allowance\nfor travel to the annual convention should be included in the\nannual dues. The suggestion was made because some accounting\nsystems provide generously for dues but provide little or\nnothing for travel.\nAll good wishes to you.\nCordially,\nKenneth Harwood, Chairman\nDepartment of Telecommunications\nkh:mk\nenc\ncc: Dr. Harry Skornia\nair mail"
