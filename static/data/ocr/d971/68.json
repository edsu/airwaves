Installation of broadcasting equipment\nat the specially designed production center will be completed\nduring the summer months, but the exact date for the start of\nbroadcasting is uncertain.\nIt was hoped that transmission could begin during the fall\nschool term, but nobody at WNYE, including top man James F.\nllacandrew, is taking any bets on any date before February, 1966.\nBy that time also, school television sets will have been con¬\nverted to receive UHF channels.\nIt is expected that program production will start next\nOctober. Fifteen new series are slated to be pre-taped and\nstockpiled for transmission during the spring of 1966. Chan¬\nnel 25 will also draw on its library of programs which were\nproduced during the past three years at Channel 13, WNDT.\nThe new programs will be aimed at the elementary, junior\nand senior high school pupils. In addition, Channel 25 will\noffer three half-hour courses weekly, after school hours, for\nwhich teachers may receive professional credit. These courses\ncover new developments in content and instructional methods\nm major subject areas.\nTTVrv. neY channel will be the television counterpart of\nvNYE-FM which has been one of the nationfs outstanding educ¬\national radio stations for over a quarter of a century. To\nmatch its call.letters, WNYE-FM has had the slogan, »We need\nyour ears.?( This slogan will also serve the new television\nchannel with only a slight change, nWe need your eyes.n"
