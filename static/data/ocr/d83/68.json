Ihe problem has\nbeen complicated by two factors.\nIn the first place, as I mentioned to you earlier might be the case,\nwe’ve practically exhausted the funds that were granted for this project\nand we simply can’t dip into our normal operating funds.\nSecondly, when we went through the report as submitted, we found so\nmany typographical errors that we are having to expend a considerable sum\nsimply to get the report in the form we honestly feel it should have been\nin (so far as typing is concerned) when it was forwarded to us. Oils not\nonly presents fiscal problems, it also makes us a little less sympathetic,\nbecause we had hoped that the report, as put together by you, would be in\nsuch form (typographically) that we would not have to have it retyped.\nUnfortunately, such was not the case.\nI’m sorry that this whole matter has evolved as it has. I guess there were\njust too many misunderstandings on both sides. Apparently we did not live\nup to all you had been led to believe would be forthcoming, and I’m afraid\nwe have been a little disappointed in final results. I trust you will try\nto understand our position in this matter, and I do regret that we will be\nunable to forward any more money to you.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEHsjl"
