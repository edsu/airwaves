I\nthink the general morale and rapport increased notably in these two groups.\nThe television meetings were extremely helpful, but this is true only because\nChuck Marquis literally took them over. He had many meaningful reports to\nmake - so many, in fact, that we had to reschedule other meetings to include\nthem all. Marjorie Newman's radio meetings were very well planned and very\nwell executed. I'm afraid the attendance at some of her sessions was hurt by\nthe occasional schedule changes that seemed prudent at the time they were made.\nI regret that I missed getting a report from Jim Petersen about his sessions.\nFinally, one personal note if I may, I enjoyed working with the session\nimmensely. If there was any major error, it was the delayed distribution of\nthe program schedule. However, I can say in all honesty that so many events\ndeveloped right on the scene at the conference that I am confident we could not\nhave adhered to any predetermined schedule unless we simply did so blindly and\ndoggedly against better judgment. I appreciate your appointing me as conference\nchairman and look forward to working with you again.\nWith best wishes.\nSincerely,\nJ ohxi' Young\nConference Chairman\nJY/af\ncc: Mr. Harold E. Hill"
