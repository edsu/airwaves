Lamb\nWTDS-FM\nToledo Public Schools\n1901 W, Central Avenue\nToledo 6, Ohio\nDear Harry:\nI should like you to accept appointment as\nChairman of the Radio Network School Committee\nof NAEB for the year 1961. This is an important\nresponsibility and one that I hope that you\ncan accept.\nEnclosed is a list of suggested names of other\nmembers of the committee. I should like to\nbegin this year a plan to help insure fuller\nparticipation by the membership in committee\nactivities by involving \"new blood\", while yet\npreserving continuity; namely, an arrangement\nwhereby members would be appointed for stipuÂ¬\nlated terms of three, two or one year. After\nthe first year, three members would go off and\nthree new members come on annually. Chairmen\nwould have one year appointments but be eligible\nfor reappointment.\nMay I have your reactions and suggestions as\nsoon as possible so that I can complete the\ncommittee roster for announcement in the next\nNewsletter.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:mem\nEnclosure"
