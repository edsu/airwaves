  "text": "Harry Skomia\n- 2 -\nJanuary 13, I960\nLet me make this as a suggestion. As a first step, perhaps I could come\nto Urbana and the three or four of us sit down and talk the proposal\nthrough putting our best thoughts down on paper. Since I will be tied\nup pretty well until the first of February here in the office, perhaps\nI can make it the 8th of February.\nThe months of February and March and the early part of April would be\nbest for me to travel. This would give us a chance to get some letters\nreturned with suggestions from various locations. The exact date for\ngetting together can be cleared a little later.\nI*m not usually so prompt in answering my mail but I have hopes of getting\nthis letter to you and Harold before his specific reply to me.\nDirector of School Programs\n.and Research\nCRT/gvn\nc.c. Harold Hill\nWilliam Harley"
