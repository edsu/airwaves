Com.\nIstanbul\nTHEME OF DISCUSSION\nAs promised during the last meeting of the Committee the\nBureau devoted some time to consideration not only of future themes\nbut also of the best method of conducting discussion on these.\nIt recognized that the formal statement by the leader of each dele¬\ngation present did not really promote the lively give and take which\nwas hoped for and felt that it would be preferable in future to\nrevert to the former practice of inviting one or two organizations\nto introduce each subject with general statements designed to pro¬\nvoke discussion.\nA number of subjects suggested themselves to the Bureau\nwhich decided to retain them for future use and amongst these were :\nthe level of presentation of news, information etc.\n(this is a pick-up of the suggestion made at the Committee's\nlast meeting by Mrs Horelli (YLE) that Radio organizations\nnot infrequently tended to talk above the heads of their\nlisteners);\nobjectivity and personalisation of news, current affairs,\ncultural and other information;\nindependence in news reporting.\nFor Istanbul, however, the Bureau decided that in view of\ncurrent developments in Radio a profitable discussion could take\nplace on the relationship, in both directions, between Radio and\nthe regional and local communities. It was agreed that the ARD,\nBBC, NRK, ORTF and RAI delegations would each make preliminary\nstatements of not more than 10 minutes each, after which the\nsubject would be thrown open for general discussion and exchange\nof views."
