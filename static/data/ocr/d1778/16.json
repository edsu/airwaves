To help establish prestige and a reputation of\nsubstance for educational radio, the NAEB produced the outstanding series.\nPeople Under Communism, The Jeffersonian Heritage, and The Ways of Mankind.\nWhen the need for information concerning the nature and effects of the\ntelevision medium became apparent, NAEB organized a series of monitoring\nstudies, the Research Fact Sheet Service, The Engineering Service and\nReports, and undertook the distribution of many kinds of useful material.\nTo supply high quality radio programs to educational stations, the Radio\nTape Network has evolved into a major operation which supplies weekly\nprograms to some 80 stations.\nThe NAEB is a working organization with cooperation as its\nkeynote.
