FEB. 1950\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nPhone 7-6611, Ext. 3394\nFirst an appeal to all members who believe in radio, and who\nDO ANYTHING ABOUT IT LIKE PRODUCING PROGRAMS POR IT, TO SEND ME SOME\nIdeas, Right now as you read this, make a note or call someone and\nASK THEM TO SEND ME AN IDEA FROM YOUR STATION FOR THE NEXT ISSUES\nKenneth Wright, Ayres 1I4., The University of Tennessee, Knoxville,\nTennessee. This goes for everyone and goes without saying to Messrs.\nEitzen, Buck, and Vogl of the Planning Sub-Committee.\nSecond, a capsule lecture. It is more important to you as a\nstation and more rewarding to you to have a program on the NAEB\nNETWORK THAN IT IS TO WIN A FEW ASSORTED NATIONAL OR STATE AWARDS.\nYet many of us submit entries in competition that we never submit\nTO OUR OWN NETWORK. I FEEL SURE THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS BEING PRO¬\nDUCED LOCALLY THAT COULD BE USED ON THE NET; NEWS BACKGROUNDING,\nLITERATURE, BOOK REVIEWS, DISCUSSIONS, DOCUMENTARY OR ACTUALITY.'\nPROGRAMS, AND PERHAPS OTHERS. JOHN HOLT TELLS ME THAT WE NEED MORE\nPROGRAMS FROM MEMBER STATIONS BEYOND THOSE PROVIDED THROUGH THE\nGrant-In-Aid program. Keep on submitting ioeas for grants, but\nCOULD YOU CONSIDER LETTING US HAVE SOME SERIES FOR WHICH GRANTS\nWERE NOT ALLOWED OR WHICH YOU DID NOT SUBMIT FOR A GRANT? THERE\nARE PLENTY OF AREAS OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE AND NEED THAT ARE NOT BE¬\nING EXPLORED ON THE NETWORK SHOWS AT PRESENT; STIR UP THE L08ES AND\nLETfS SEE WHAT WE CAN GET.\nNO SPECIFIC PROGRAM IDEA AS SUCH THIS WEEK SINCE WE!RE OUT OF\nMATERIAL TO STEAL FROM AND THOUGHT THIS SPACE COULD BE BETTER USED\nTO ARGUE WITH YOU ABOUT THE ABOVE. QUIT HIDING YOUR LIGHT; WE NEED\nSOME OF IT.\n--Ken Wright, WUOT"
