As long as we are sending\nout a lengthy questionnaire, which will take considerable time to fill out,\nwe might as well have it complete0 It is my hope that this will be a start\nin supplying us with information about all the network stations which wa can\nuse in trying to arrive at programming and distribution policies which will\nbest serve their needso\nSo, any and all suggestions will be most welcome* We should have these\nback from the stations before changing over to individual station service—\nand that may be sooner than any of us suspect* Therefore, may I request\nthat you start your reactions on their way to me no later than TWO WEEKS\nafter the receipt of this memo?\nMany thanks for all the trouble*\nBest regards*\nDick Rider"
