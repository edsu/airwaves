Furthermore, an application\nfor a construction permit to build a station in Mobile is in\npreparation. In keeping with our pattern in Alabama, we are\ndoing all of this on a shoestring.\nNothing in the world would be more helpful in this hour than a\nshot in the arm from national legislation now in the hopper for\neducational television. Could you advise me as to when this\nlegislation might possibly be cleared by your Rules Committee?\nWith kindest regards, I am\nSincerely yours,\nRDH/ml\nRaymond D, Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager"
