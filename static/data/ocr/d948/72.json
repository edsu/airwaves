We must write as potently as we can, as\nwisely as we can, as inspiringly as we can,”\nMrs. Helen Stanley, formerly Script Editor of the Wisconsin School of the\nAir, pointed out that \"Radio began as an engineers baby - as an electronic\nmiracle. But radio has become a medium for the writer, for the transmission of\nideas. And as radio has come of age, we radio writers have arrived. We are a\nprofession, and an important one.\"\nThe feature address of the evening was delivered by Dr. Harold Hand, Pro¬\nfessor of Education at the University of Illinois. Dr. Hand»s address was entitled\n\"How Well Do You Know Your Audience?\" By \"audience\" he meant, for the assembled\nwriters of in-school programs,\na) The teachers who decide whether or not to use the writer*s materials.\nb) The pupils of the teachers who do decide to use those materials.\nHis basic points were that:\na) If they are to be used, these materials must help the teachers to get\ndone the things they believe a good school should do.\nb) If they are to be useful to pupils, these materials must be suited to\nthe interest, needs, and capabilities of the pupils.\nDr. Hand then summarized some of the things that teachers believe a good\nschool should do.\nI. The good school attempts to serve all the children of all the people.\nA) These children differ in many ways which are significant for educa¬\ntion, Unless radio writers take these significant differences into\naccount, their materials cannot be very helpful to the teacher who is\ntrying to serve all the children of all the people.\nB) Some of these educationally significant differences are:\n1) The kinds of children in the school, who differ in:\na) What they need to learn.\nb) What they are able to learn.\nc) What they want to learn."
