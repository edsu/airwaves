Uy apologies\nfor not getting back to you sooner but, as I guess Vee Kounas\nwrote you, I was out of the office sick for a couple of weeks.\nBy now you should have received the twenty-five membership\nblanks you requested. I'm soriy those forms aren’t better look¬\ning, but I am afraid they’ll have to do until such time as our\ntreasury can stand the shock of a few extra printing bills.\nSince this Division is not ideally set up as far as mimeo¬\ngraphing is concerned, it would help us a great deal If, insofar\nas possible, you could arrange to have any membership materials\nduplicated locally in the future.\nWhile I am still not content with the number of new AERT\nmemberships coming in, I am happy to report that we are presently\nreceiving a number of inquiries, plus a few five-dollar checks,\nfl~a areas of interest heretofore not represented in AERT. I\nbelieve this signifies that we are on the road to substantially\nbroadening our membership base, and this of course is good.\nGood luck to you in your continued efforts on behalf of AERT.\nI hope I’ll have the pleasure of talking with you at the meeting\nin Columbus in April.\nKindest personal regards.\nSincerely,\nJohn Adams Rourke\nrational Membership Chairman\nAERT"
