U.\nAPO 500\nSan Francisco, California\nDear Mr. Lerchi\nWith regard to your card postmarked April 30, I have received the latest\nREPORT FROM JAPAN program. According to my count, we now have four (4) tapes\nincluding the first one which you suggested might be disregarded.\nI have sent copies of all programs to Siegel in Few York, but have not\nreceived his reactions, save for the first one which he thought good and promisÂ¬\ning. If possible, we would prefer the news to be rather general, not tied down\nto specific dates.\nPersonally, I have enjoyed the programs received so far. Keep up the good\nwork*.\nSincerely,\nREU/cb\nRobert E. Underwood, Jr\nNetwork Manager"
