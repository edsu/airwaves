Since the NAEB believes in the eventual integrated uses\nof all electronic media for education, it is particularly interested in keeping\nboth radio and television in a position to share the electronic educational\nload, which we believe the future holds in store, and which will require all\nthe facilities and trained uses in both media which our nation can provide •"
