Much booking time and space is saved by the use of this\ntype file when large numbers of titles are regularly dealt with.\nThe problems involved in developing a uniform procedure for the booking of\naudio—visual equipment and materials are many. Procedures in use range from\nthose in which all equipment is furnished \"free\" for campus needs to a most com¬\nplex system of internal charges for all supplies and equipment* Booking proce¬\ndures need constant evaluation, study, and improvement.\nAccurate information on all costs of inventory, on costs of servicing and\nmaintenance, on transportation, and other costs of day-to-day bookings and\nservice should be maintained. Records should be kept of campus as well as off-\ncampus service (Fig. _). In practice, a cost accounting form maybe prepared\n'in triplicate. The first sheet is the booker!s record, copy two is the user*s\nconfirmation record, and copy three, in a more durable weight, is the permanent\nbookkeeping and accounting card.\nMost educational institutions have found that operator assignment sheets\nare necessaiy for each job. These sheets also serve as an accounting-data\nsheet from which payroll time forms are made up for each operator. Visual\nschedule boards (Fig. _) are recommended as a means of providing complete in¬\nformation on operator assignments and the location of equipment and materials.\nRecommended space allocation for booking of materials, equipment, and\noperators: 100 - UOO sq. ft.\nb. Storage of Materials - The proper storage of instructional materials is\nimportant to insure good service. Materials cannot be of service when they are\nunsystematically packed into overcrowded spaces, stacked carelessly in cabinets."
