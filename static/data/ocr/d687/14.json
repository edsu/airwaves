However, if I may, I»ll\ndisagree with you again. X feel that we should proceed to process member¬\nship applications on a regular basis. If Graydon is not quite ready to\nappoint his committees, may I suggest to him that he informally appoint\nyou on an interim basis until all committees are formally announced?\nUntil he takes such action, I will continue to send the applications to\nyou for your possible use.\nIn that regard, I am enclosing with this letter two more applications.\nMth MilSs—'\nExecutive Director\nJSMsll\nocs Graydon Ausmus"
