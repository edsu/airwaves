Obviously, if the mini¬\nmum amount of $25,000 was to come from the MAEB coffers, it would be $25,000\nthat would not be spent elsewhere) and in view of the doubtful results of the\nproject, I would consider it very poor business to make such an expenditure.\nX seem to sense the suggestion in Bemie ’ s letter that maybe the various\nstations would contribute to the kitty for this purpose.

For your information a little guide for the use of educa¬\ntional station staff members is in press now and will shortly be distributed\nby the HAEB.\nI am sorry to be so negativistic about this matter, but I am always open for\nfurther discussion if desirable.\nRadio and Television Communications\nms turn\nccs Mr.\nMr.\nMr.\nMr.\nMr.\nMr.\nMr.\nHarold Hill ^\nWilliam Bender\nJohn White\nWilliam Harley\nBernard K strains\nFranklin Bouwssw\nLeonard Marks"
