Mott\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\n1346 Connecticut Ave., N. W.\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nFor what it*s worth if the date is not too late, I would like to\nregister my flat opposition to the proposed amendment in the\nPublic Broadcasting Financing Act which would require public\nradio stations to record and retain all public issue programs.\nSuch legislation implies a control-check system which would be\ninnocuous to the broadcaster wanting to exercise true freedom of\neditorial judgement in the best sense of the words, \"public inter¬\nest.” I fear such an amendment and its attendant implications may\ncause some public radio people to back away from the public affairs/\nissues area, the exact opposite of what public radio should be\ndoing. Or, at best, cause very bland treatment of such affairs/\nissues.\nSecondarily, such recording and retention is a traffic/records-\nkeeping job that many stations can ill-afford to instigate much less\nsustain. And for a station active in the public affairs/issues area,\nthe cost of tape itself could become a burden to an already thin\nbudget.\nI flatly oppose the amendment. And if you have the opportunity to\nuse this contribution, it would be appreciated.\nHinz\nGeneral Manager\nRobert C.\nRCH/bb\nOregon Educational Broadcasting: KOAC AM-TV Corvallis and KOAP FM-TV Portland\nTHE DIVISION OF CONTINUING EDUCATION SERVES THE STATE OF OREGON THROUGH FACILITIES AND RESOURCES OF COLLEGES AND UNIVER¬\nSITIES OF THE OREGON STATE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER EDUCATIONAL AND STATE AGENCIES"
