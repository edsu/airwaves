Drop him\na note quickly if it should be sent elsewhere than to your home address.\nI don’t recall when you ”go West.”\n^our letter to Sam was fine. After you've got an itinerary and procedure\nplan, you’ll need to meet with the Committee, chaired by him, to go\nover to get you launched ♦ This will be after September 1, I expect,\nwhen funds are available, but not too long after.\nI like the approach you outline to media specialists. ”What can my\nmedium uniquely do V And what can’t it do as compared with other\nmedia ? And what are the changes mine is undergoing in the melee, in\nthe face of the pressures of the others?” We’re beginning to get some\ngood starting questions, I think. If we can find the right people to\nanswer them, we’ll have useful data,\nSam's still a bit concerned with the absence of something he can get\nhis hands on as procedures and research or experiment design» As the\npresent muchness becomes succinct sharpness, the necessary focus and\nsteps win begin to emerge. Much of this will need to take place in your\nown mind, prodded by critical, though friendly, questions.\nShould w© try to use part of consultant funds for someone like Foshay to\nride herd on you on our behalf ? Hot sure Sam feels either he or the Com¬\nmittee will be up to it with other pressures; he raised this question.\nAnd the number of balls we here now have in the air seems to multiply\ndaily, as far as I am concerned personally, to try to follow in detail."
