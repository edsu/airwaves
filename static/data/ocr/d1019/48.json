In the light of this,\nI think that your letter is excellent. As I see it, what you propose\nis the most reasonable (both financially and administratively) plan which\ncould be carried out, X will be interested in his response.\nBusy as the devil, WO are moving into a new home a week from Monday -\nbig old place - and are busy refinishing floors, painting, moving small\nthings over, etc. On top of this I find that X committed myself to a\nmeeting at Wisconsin on the worst possible days - Thursday, Friday, and\nSaturday of next week — just before we move. Should be an interesting\nmeeting, Xt is on approaches to the historical study of mass communi¬\ncations, As you know, they have started a \"center\" for such studies\nthere. Have accumulated some interesting materials,\nHope all is going well with you and that you are as happy to see some\nhint of spring — finally — as we are.\nBest,\nSamuel L, Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLB:ks"
