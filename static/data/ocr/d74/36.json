Harley\nSeptember 11, 1961\nPage 2\nI would suggest that we bring this up for consideration of the\nentire research committee prior to the NAEB convention so that some\nfirm decision could be made there. Let me know if this is all right\nwith you. If so, I can send each one a copy of your proposal to see\nwhat the reaction is.\nBy the way, please have your secretary delete the ‚Äù609 10th Avenue\"\nin the address you have for me. It is incorrect.\nSincerely,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
