Hull\nDirector, Radio TV.\nIowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Dicki,\nThanks for your kind noteconeerning cur program\nlog. 1 have no breakdown of our operations and assure you\nif I took time to make a breakdown of the operations it\nwould break down. In other words, we are busy - but having\nworlds of fun. Our motto is \"Death can be beautiful.\"\nGlad you met my Deanj he is a wonderful old man,\nvery progressive, and as you say, a good supporter of our\noperation.\nI have a few ideas on the NAEB net and shall be\nglad to kick in with my 2# worth. % main feeling is thet\nwe had bettor get our extension program set up as quickly\nas possible. I have one show on Mental Hygiene - once a\nweek, 30 minutes - that is strictly goqd. It will be worth\ntime on anybodyâ€™s station. 1 wish we could get some money\nto start one outstanding series which I cannot touch without\nhelp but which others might be able to do in their own\nlocality. These and a number of other ideas need hashing\nover and I shall, ovgcourse, be very much interested in the\nideas of the other people on this subject. I feel we are on\ntiie brink of doing some really great things ourrnlve3.\nI shall be looking forward to seeing Sunday.\n- Sincerely yours.\nGraydon Ausmus, Director\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nGA/ms"
