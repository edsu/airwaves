Wood\nSorry you were out when I called you this morning,\nbut I talked with Harry and he informed me that there\nwas nothing new on the utilization kit proposal to the\nU. S. Office, As I told him, I had heard off the record\nthat it was going to be funded and that John Meany would\nbe getting in touch with us, I am anxious to find out\nwhat they have in mind. I sincerely hope they do not\nwash out utilization proposals in light of the contract\nthey have awarded the University of Nebraska,\nEnclosed with this note is the bill from Marguerite\non the expenses for the NAEB utilization kit. There is\nstill some work to be done on this kit but I'm not sure\nhow much.\nWe have been very busy here trying to get our subur¬\nban school program project over the hill. I have had to\nset the NAEB utilization kit project aside. However, now\nI feel the pressure lessening a bit and we can get back\nto pulling something together.\nCJ/dir R.
