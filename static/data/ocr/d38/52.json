They would present\nsome of the great historical struggles and debates—the crucibles in\nwhich many of America*s principles and values were crystallized.\nHere* as in other proposed series, programs would be presented in\nsequential units of varying lengths. For example9 units of 13 talks\nand 13 dramas on \"The Jackson Era\"5 a series of nine broadcasts by the\nJustices of the U. S. Supreme Court on \"liberty and Law\" or \"The Course\nof American Democratic Thought\"; and other units developed by consulting\narea specialists.\nThe minimum budget requirements for programs in this series is $57*000.00.\nThese programs of distinguished content and production quality dealing with\npersistent issues of continuing interest and importance would immediately be\nrebroadcast a number of times by each of the educational stations and, also/\nin future years as a part of a library of educational recordings.\nIn order that selected portions of the materials produced for broadcast in\nthese five series of programs may receive circulation in print, $5*000 is\nbudgeted for printing costs. It is expected that commercial publishing firms\nwould undertake to publish some of the material at no cost to the project.\nTee budget of $16*000 for central administration of the programs in this\nProject is intended to supplement the headquarters staff of the Educational\nRadio Network working out of its University of Illinois headquarters.\nThe programs in these five subject areas will be made available for rebroad¬\ncasting in Canada, England, Australia, South Africa, and for other distribi ion\nby the Division of Mass Communications of UNESCO.\nt"
