Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\n600 North Park Street\nMadison Wisconsin\nDear Waggish Wun:\nOh.lovely!.... cried she, flailing about in\nan unmaidenly flap of pure enchantment!\nSuch gorgeous idiocy has not come my way in a long\nand barren time...and it goes a fur piece (a colloquialism,\nnot a mink stole) to reaffirm my conviction (already strongly\nrooted by Arlene) that Wisconsin is a breeding place of true\ngiants!\nI opened your letter on a pretty nothin’ morning, smiled\na wan smile at the beginning, shifted to a chuckle, then to a\ngood ho-ho...and...on the M.A. Thesis...went into the uncon¬\ntrollable “honks”. Alarmed members of my peer-group poured\nfrom all the offices, avid for catastrophe, and found me\nstricken and helpless...waving the pages and still honking\nlike a wild and witless goose. My twin sister read it and\nwants you for Christmas. I've been trying to think of an\noccasion before that when a gift to me is Justified. Let's\nsee. Mothers' Day and my birthday are behind me. How about\nthe Witches’ Sabbath? You could mail yourself C.O.D. I'd\ngladly pay the charges on a kindred soul...fool that I am\nfor such gifted nonsense.\nDelightedly,"
