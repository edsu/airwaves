Two of the immediate results in the educa¬\ntional field were the establishment of American citizenship courses in the public schools\nof Tulsa and at Muskogee. Officials of these school systems attended the Forum and a\nfew weeks later called upon Dr. Benson to address the faculties and student bodies to\ninaugurate new citizenship courses built with the Forum materials.\nCentral Christian College co-sponsored the Forum with the National Program.\nBy popular demand of the 115 conferees and the distinguished industrial leaders on the\nOklahoma Advisory Committee this Oklahoma City Forum is to become an annual affair.\nAt the April Forum in Searcy we were hosts to 107 people from 25 states.\nState Departments of Education in Virginia and Washington, school systems from 15\nstates and three colleges and universities were represented in the conferee body. The\nForum concentrated its attention on the problem of achieving widespread dissemination\nof the comparative facts of political and economic systems. Eight members of the Forum\nAdvisory Committee—personnel and communications executives from General Motors,\nGeneral Electric, Folger’s Coffee, Pepsi-Cola Bottlers, Hinde & Dauch, Monsanto Chemi¬\ncal, the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and the Washington State Department of\nPublic Instruction—personally assisted the NEP staff with the operation of the Forum.\nForum-end evaluations and specific back-home results reported were especially en¬\ncouraging to Dr. Benson and gave assurance that this Forum was one of the most suc¬\ncessful in the series begun 10 years ago. Many of the 26 educators in attendance spoke up\nat the final session to pledge themselves to the immediate development of classroom\ncourses designed to bring about a keen appreciation of our private enterprise economic\nsystem and our Republican form of Government. A feature of Forum XIX was the\nattendance of 31 retired U. S. Army Colonels and Generals, residents and most of them\nemployed in Arkansas Educational Work. They were special conferee guests of the NEP.\n(See roster on back page.)\nGlenn Green begins his Vu-graph Retired generals\nreport on the welfare states show keen interest\nChairman Mills of House Ways and\nMeans, in Harding auditorium"
