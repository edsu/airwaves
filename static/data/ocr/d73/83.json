  "text": "Great as its potential is, however, television\nis not the only new tool available to improve\neducational quality.\nThe school of tomorrow will have elec¬\ntronic teaching machines that will free the\ninstructor from routine tasks and give him\nmore time for personal counseling. The\nteacher’s desk will be equipped with a tiny\nelectronic scanning device linked with the\nlibrary and the records office so that references\ncan be checked quickly. A small-size elec¬\ntronic computer will correct many types of\nexaminations, process student records, survey\nperformance and determine areas of difficulty.\nMagnetic tape, which is even now finding\nuse in the schools as well as in your own edu¬\ncational stations, will extend its usefulness in\nthe years ahead. In fact, schools might well\nstart on a program of automation today with\na relatively inexpensive magnetic tape sound\nsystem, and build up from there.\nNow under development at the RCA Lab¬\noratories is a magnetic tape player capable of\nreproducing pictures as well as sound. It\nworks through a standard television receiver.\nIt also includes a recorder attachment\nwhich can pick up a program from a TV set,\na closed-circuit system or a studio. A tape\nrecord made in any of these ways is ready to\nbe played back immediately — without any\nprocessing — through a television receiver.\nThis video tape player will eventually be a\nnatural complement to a school television sys¬\ntem. It will permit the flexible use of a library\nof pre-recorded programs.\nBy comparison with present professional\nvideo tape recorders used in television stations,\nthe new apparatus will be low in cost. It may\nbe set up to supply a pre-recorded program to\none classroom, a group of classrooms, an entire\nschool, or a whole school system.\n6"
