C. 20036\nDear Jerry:\nOn March 8th, after the Long Range Financing Conference,\nI took the opportunity of visiting the Oregon Congressional\nDelegation to voice our support of the legislation introduced\nby Senator Magnuson, and some of our concerns regarding the\nproposed revision to the copyright law. I spoke directly with\nSenator Morse and Representatives Ullman and Dellenback. I\nalso spoke with Mr. Bird and Mr. Lee of Senator Morse*s staff.\nI spoke with Pat Manny, Edith Green*s administrative assistant,\nand was unable to see anyone in Congressman Wyatt *s office. I\nleft material particularly about Oregon with all of the con¬\ngressional delegation.\nGenerally speaking, I think I can reflect a sympathetic\nattitude on the part of most of the Oregon delegation. In the\nnext week or so I will be sending them some specific information\nregarding copyright and how it might affect the Oregon situation.\nGood luck on your hearings coming up and at least the Oregon\ndelegation will have heard something about it before they get it\nin the Congressional Record.\nRegards,\nLuke F.
