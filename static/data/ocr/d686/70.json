One of the\ndevelopments that I shall always remember concerning this\nperiod of time is the magnificent manner in which everyone\nhas pitched in to do a job of preserving television for the\neducational establishments.\nInsofar as the denunciation by commercial operators\nis concerned, we have not yet begun to feel the brunt. In the\ncity by city hearings which will begin on or about June 11,\nI have no doubt that all the stops will be pulled. It is going\nto require a great deal of courage and stamina to stand the gaff.\nI am enclosing a copy of the Presidents Page for the\nnext issue of the \"News-Letter,” It will give you the background\nof what has to be done immediately if we are to maintain our\nposition in the hearings.\nI look forward with a great deal of anticipation to\nseeing you at Columbus. There is a tremendous quantity of fill-in\nwhich has to be done. I regret only that I have not been able to\nkeep you abreast of the startling developments which have taken\nplace.\nWith all best wishes, I am\nSNSsas\nEnc,\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
