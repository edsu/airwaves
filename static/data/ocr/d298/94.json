Hull\n-2-\nJanuary l4, 1948\nour School of the Air programs , the Farm Program, the Homemakers\nProgram, Legislative Forum, and the features of general interest\nof a like nature. That station operates during day-time hours\nonly. I was up there today and they don’t seem to have much of\nan eye for the use of FM. They do cover quite a section in the\nmiddle of the state and feel that perhaps our FM activities\nwould not be working along the same lines as they' are now\nworking. There is nothing serious, however, and we’ll come out\nwith a working agreement I’m certain. They are glad to take\nanything which is good and will probably use on AM a lot of the\nprograms we do on FM. That will give double coverage until such\ntime as FM receivers are in general use. From the map you'll\nnotice that the Rib Mountain station is just to the north of\nStevens Point and inasmuch as that will be the one station\nwhich has the largest coverage, by virtue of its location on\ntop of Rib Mountain, it will reach the same area as is now\nserved by WLBL.\nIt was good to get your report and to know that you have\nthings under control. You've surely had a busy time and I can’t\nsee much of a rest ahead for you for some time. I hope that\nthe boys will come through with stories and give you the help\nyou deserve on the News-Letter. Best of luck.\nCordially\nHAE:jh\nend."
