He thinks that it will come through without\nany difficulty, and the grant will be from July 15th to\nJanuary 15th, 1955.\nI see from the copy of the letter by Francis Young\nto Harry Skornla dated June 25rd that a Fullbright to Great\nBritain may work out for 1955-1956, providing we come up with\na return soholar for 1954-1955. This, I believe, scotches\nany notion that the 1954 Fullbright was knocked out because\nof our failure to contribute to the BBC Transcription Fund.\nIt was good seeing you the other day. I am sending\nyou, under separate cover, the copy of the material that you\nsent to Marshall.\nWith all best washes, believe me\nleyipour N. Siegel\nDirector\nSNS/cb\nM Tlic Voice Of TTie\nCity"
