Also, serves added purposes of helping clear\ntop of mine now.\nI've been meaning to write this for a long time.\nI'm greatly concerned about decision to change name of the\nAdvisory Committee to the President of the ETRC. I’m not\neven sure it’s legal to do so. But more important to me\nis the backward step. The Committee was set up with a\npurpose, and to me that purpose still exists. In Ann Arbor\nyou said we couldn't hope to advise the President of the\nCenter. With this I also must disagree. We have done so,\nand we can continue to do so. And it was intended so by\nthe people who gave the money.\nI don't think liason and advisory have the same\nmeanings.\nWhile I feel strongly, this letter is not written with\nbelligerence. It’s written because of strong convention,\nhowever.\nTrust you h ve a pleasant vacation.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFES:nb"
