  "text": "In 1952 the Adult Education Committee of the National Association of Educa¬\ntional Broadcaster^ working under a grant from The Fund for Adult Education, under¬\ntook the preparation of a series of half-hour radio programs designed to summarize\nthe major ideas and actions of Thomas Jefferson.\nDoctor Dumas Malone of Columbia University, one of the country’s major author¬\nities on the life and work of Jefferson, was engaged as consultant and worked with\nseveral leading script-writers in the preparation of the content of the series of\nthirteen programs. A cast of professional actors, headed by Claude Rains, who\nplayed the role of Jefferson — put these programs on records. The title of the\nseries was \"The Jeffersonian Heritage\" and in the year and a half since it was com¬\npleted, it has been broadcast over scores of educational and commercial radio\nstations in the United States and abroad.\nSince many of the central issues with which Jefferson was concerned in his\nday are still with us, the Experimental Discussion Project of The Fund for Adult\nEducation conceived the idea of using selected recordings in this radio series as\na basis for a series of group discussion programs. Doctor Malone, consultant for\n\"The Jeffersonian Heritage\" was engaged to prepare written materials for group mem¬\nbers to read in advance of listening to the recordings. These materials, together\nwith brief synopses of each of the recordings used in this discussion series en¬\ntitled \"Jefferson and Our Times\" make up the contents of this booklet.\nExperimental Discussion Program\nSubject to Revision"
