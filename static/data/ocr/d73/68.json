Such\na statement by a person of such prominence in the commercial side\nof the industry will carry great weight in shaping the attitude of the\nCongress, the broadcasting industry, and the general puhlic.\nThis letter concerns the other matter Leonard Marks and I discussed\nwith you just before the hearing; namely, the conference on school\nbroadcasting to be held in Rome this year.\nAs you recall, Mr. Marks, our general counsel, represented the\nNAEB at a European Broadcasting Union meeting in Madrid, in\nNovember. At the meeting a Professor Rodino, of Italy, presented\na paper on the efforts of RAI to use television for in-school use. Mr.\nMarks spoke about the experience of the NAEB in the field of\neducational radio and television and aroused such widespread interest\nthat it was agreed that a conference on school broadcasting should\nbe held Idn Rome at an early date. Professor Rodino was appointed to\nhead a committee to work out arrangements. (This committee is\nmeeting on March 13th, and Mr. Marks will confer with Professor\nRodino in Rome March 9th.) Mr. Marks was told repeatedly by\nrepresentatives of various foretgh governments present, that the Rome\nmeeting would not be a success unless the NAEB played an active\nrole in the deliberations. We should very much like to do so.\nOur plan would be to assemble a four-man team of outstanding\nspecialists with notable experience in particular aspects of school\nbroadcasting in America. A completely planned and organized pre¬\nsentation would then be put together, utilizing the specialists in\nMlives‘ reports supported by carefully prepared graphics and excerpts"
