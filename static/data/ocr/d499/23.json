C.\nDear Cliff8\nNAEB is about to become a member of the Asian Broadcasting\nUnion, which is holding its next general assembly in\nSingapore, October 23-30. See attached communiques.\nI may or may not attend, depending on several factors.\nOne of them would be whether there were anything in\nconnection with the AID interests in Southeast Asia\nthat I could attend to if I were to travel to the area.\nIf may well be premature to do anything more on the\nSEAMES front at this time? on the other hand, if there\nis anything to be explored further in Bangkok, or with\nSEAMES country representatives at the Singapore meeting,\nI would be glad to consider it in formulating my plans.\nWe will have the Southeast Asia report in your hands\nvery soon.\nCordially,\nWilliam G.
