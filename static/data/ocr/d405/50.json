It will indicate the estimated\ntotal size of the school audience as covered by the NAEB Network. We anticipate\nthat this figure may be astounding to us as well as to administrators, foundations,\nand the general public.\nThis can be prepared in time for the April meeting if you will send us the\nfollowing information immediately:\nAre any NAEB In-School Network programs carried on your station? _\nIf so, please estimate:\n1 - Number of cities using the programs from your station _______________\n2 - Number of schools using these programs\n3 - Size of weekly audience listening each week _\nPlease keep in mind the probability of there being more than one school in\ncities listed, more than one class in given grade levels, consolidated, rural,\nparochial, private, and public school listeners in many areas.\nIf you have, or can get, any evidences of the value of such programs -\nletters from teachers and administrators - from which we could quote, will you\nplease send copies?"
