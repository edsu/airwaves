Wright\nDirector of Broadcasting\nUniversity of Tennessee\nKnoxville, Tennessee\nDear Ken:\nCan you have the Program Planning Committee survey thoroughly\nthe area or areas in which good programs are needed and which probably\nare not now available or will not be forthcoming from the 1956 grants-\nin-aid? I would like a recommendation of three such series of programs\nwith order preference indicated and also preliminary budgetary costs\nalong with possible source or sources and possible production center\nor centers. Could I have this within the next sixty days?\nTo guide you, I have in mind requesting the Center to contract\nfor one or more series. Available in the Center budget for this purpose\nis the sura of approximately SIB,000 for each of two years. I have asked\nPresident Newburn to have this year's sum reappropriated so that we\nmight have as much as $36,000 to spend.\nOne series X wish your committee would give special consideration\nto is the DeTocqueville Scripts. There are seven such scripts written\nby Lester Sinclair of Canada. Copies are available, but presently not\nat headquarters since we have loaned them to FAE. I will try to get\nahold of them within the next month and send them to you.\nMissed you in Columbus. Best regards.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFES:js\ncc: Dr. H. J. Skornia"
