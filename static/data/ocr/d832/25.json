S. Novik. In her introduction\nDr. Warren said:\n\"Mr. Novik has hitched himself to some of the most interesting people. I\nprefer to sit beside him and ask him questions as he wants you all to do. He at\none time managed Clarence Darrow and Bertrand Russell, both intriguing in their own\nway$ he was right-hand-man to Mayor La Guardia and since that time has managed\nWNYC and worked through that to the people of New York. He has been labor consul¬\ntant for various organizations and is now Management Relations consultant for\nthe NAEB.\"\nMr. Novik then spoke on \"A Suggested Philosophy of Educational Television Re¬\nlationships with the Community.\" Mr. Novik*s speech was ad lib, and unfortunately\nno record was made of his remarks.
