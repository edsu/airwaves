A first reaction might be that this is more\nthan offset by the lack of available light as compared with current methods; however,\nthe instantaneous intensity of the flying spot is considerably higher than the eye\nmight indicate, therefore the practical signal to noise ratio is more determined by\nphoto-cell noise and the ambient darkness of the studio location than fey other\ncircuit factor So Since conventional studio illumination is eliminated there is a\ndrastic reduction in the cost of electrical energy expended for studio lights*\nThis latter fact, desirable as it may seem, leads into an enumeration of\nsome of the shortcomings of the system at its present state of development,.\nFirst of all, the system must be operated in a light-proof studio in which\ngeneral illumination, if desired, must be obtained from pulsed light sources\nwhich are keyed on only during the television blanking-period* This is of course\nnecessary so as to permit the photo-cell units to respond only to the light\nproduced by the flying spot source*\nUnless new and ingenuous adjuncts to the system might be evolved it is\ndifficult to see how the flying spot technique will ever be capable of operation\nout-of-doors where random light cannot be controlled*\nContrasting some of the simplifications which the system provides, there"
