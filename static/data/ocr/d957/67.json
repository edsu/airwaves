He has character,\nability, personality, imagination and leadership. His loyalty\nis unquestioned. He served with the United States Navy in the\nSecond World War. He was long associated with Professor Frederick\nH. Koch and with Professor Samuel Seldon. He has good health,\na good voice, and is an educational pioneer in the field of\ndramatics, speech and broadcasting.\nI would regret very much to see him leave the\nUniversity of North Carolina but, at the same time, I would\nnot wish to have him denied the opportunity which your considera¬\ntion would open to him.\nYours sincerely.\n—{j *\nD\nFrank P. Graham"
