Wells Foshay,\nDick Evans, Sam Becker, and others have helped, and should still be paid at\nleast $100 or so each out of this, if possible, for past and future consultant\nassistance« There may be some other minor obligations in this respect,\nHere's what I would suggest. By the end of this month, the project will be\n6/10 (six months out of ten) completed.

We can\ndiscuss the beat uses to be made of these materials after we see them.\nThis would mean reduction of the total contract sum from $35,015 to a round\nsum near $27,000, which w© get by subtracting the $5,015 still payable and"
