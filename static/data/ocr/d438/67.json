  "text": "(Television in Instruction)\nTelevision cannot be evaluated in terms of ’’subjects\" -- history and\nscience, reading and art. To do so would be to misrepresent both the learning\nprocess and.television as a means of communication.\nOf course the particular purpose television can serve in one subject area\nmay be different from that which it serves in another. But fundamentally the\nframe of reference should be THE BROAD ELEMENTS OF LEARNING, regardless\nof the subject being taught.\nTELEVISION CAN BRING TO THE CLASSROOM A VARIETY OF\nLEARNING SITUATIONS IN EVERY SUBJECT AREA."
