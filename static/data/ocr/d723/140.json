The Network distributes\napproximately ei$it hours of programming, by tape recording, weekly, to\nmembers subscribing to its service. This fee is also baaed on power (with\nthe same power classifications as membership) and a new station does not have\nto pay the full fee until the third year it is in the Network, The fees are:\nClass B 250.00 375.00 500.00\nClass C 150.00 225.00 300.00\nstations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from\nNetwork Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A station\npaying its full third-year rate is paying only a little over $2 an hour for\nbetter than 400 hours of programming from the Network in a year. This is\nabout the most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you have\nfurther questions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E.
