Dr. McLuhan, please let us know and we\nshall write to the Office of Education and ask them to send you a\nprinted copy of the complete National Defense Education Act.\nSince, as you probably know, NAEB Headquarters will be transferred\nto Washington, D. C. soon, I shall be leaving my position here.\nI regret very much having to leave but feel so much richer in experÂ¬\nience for having worked for and with people like Dr. Skornia, Mr.\nHill and yourself. My very best wishes to you and yours for 1961.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Rose Schmidt\nStaff Associate\nrs:l"
