Seay\nPage 12\nSeptember 22, 1955\nfinancial support or self-support is achieved, we feel that the work of the\nN£EB must go on even if on a restricted basis* It has been the source of\nconsiderable pride and satisfaction to us to note the extent to which Foun¬\ndations, led by Kellogg, have recognized that the educational crisis we\nare in requires that we put first things first, which in some cases has meant\nplacing certain problems ahead of financial ones*\nIf the W. K* Kellogg Foundation feels that an additional grant\nto us is justified, we shall be glad to report and discuss our progress with\nyou regularly each year and to revise our grant requests downwards if and\nas new sources of self-support develop* We prefer to do more than we prom¬\nise, rather than less* And we hope our record so far, both with regard\nto the Network and our Headquarters, may justify confidence and pride*\nAs further discussion, explanations, or data are desired. Presi¬\ndent Schooley and I shall be most pleased to provide them, or to inset with\nyou at your convenience* At that time I hope it may also be possible to\nreview with you the credit to be given the W. K* Kellogg Foundation in fu¬\nture NAEB projects and publications. This is especially desirable in view\nof the greatly increased output of the NAEB in areas supported by the Foun¬\ndation*\nMeanwhile our sincere thanks for the opportunity to provide you\nthis additional statement, on behalf of President F* E* Schooley and the\nNAEB Board of Directors, and for your patience in allowing us additional\ntime to prepare it*\nSincerely,\nHarry (£. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJSicr"
