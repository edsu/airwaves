  "text": "la testifying before this Commission in the matter of editorializing\nby broadcast licensees, I must make it clear that I speak only as an\nindividual. The Institute for Education by Ea&io, of which I am director,\nis an educational activity carried oh by the Ohio State University. It\nbrings together broadcasters, educators and civic leaders to consider broads\ncasting problems and to exchange ideas and techniques as a means of furthering\nthe use of radio for broadly educational purposes. Those who attend represent\nwidely varying viewpoints and interests so that it would be impossible for\nme to speak for such a group« Indeed the Institute bans formal resolutions\nas being inconsistent with its educational purpose •- the presentation cf\nissues, problems, techniques and ideas which m^y be of benefit to those who\nattend.\n<&e matter of editorializing by radio stations was considered at a\ngeneral session of the Seventeenth Institute for Education by Radio last\nKay. Varied points of view were presented in the talks and discussion* I\nattach the printed proceedings of this session to my testimony as Exhibit A\nin the hope that it may prove helpful to the Commission.\nAs an individual, however, I am glad to have this opportunity of\npresenting my point of view on the matter of editorializing by broadcast\nlicensees. The issue at stake here is of paramount importance for the whole\nfuture of broadcasting in the United States. A departure from the Mayflower\ndecision by the Commission might change materially the practices of stations\nIn the discharge of their responsibility for serving the public interesta\nconvenience and necessity. Since radio is such a powerful medium, the manner\nin which it is used in relation to controversial matters will inevitably\naffect the social, economic, and political structure of American life."
