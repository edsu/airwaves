  "text": "PLACEMENT SERVICE NEWS\nNot long ago, the Placement Service instituted a project which,\nwhen completed, will be of great assistance to all educational\nbroadcasters•\nThe purpose of this project is to establish a Personnel Class¬\nification and definite Job Descriptions for educational broadcasting.\nWe feel that it is necessary for us to formulate this information\nbefore educational broadcasting reaches its maximum potential. Thus,\nwe will have a firm foundation upon which to rely when confronted\nwith the new problems expansion will bring. Also, the completion\nof this project will facilitate our service to you by enabling us\nto give you exactly what you want.\nIn connection with this, the Placement Service recently con¬\nducted a survey to determine the number and types of personnel used\nby educational stations and production centers. The response to\nthis survey has been fairly good, but in order not to omit anyone\nand to accomplish our initial purpose, we should like to have a\n100^ return.\nTo those who have responded, we extend our grateful thanks.\nTo those who through an oversight have not yet returned the survey\nform, we urge you to do so as soon as possible.\nOur final tabulation will begin as soon as the remainder of\nthe survey forms are received. At that time we will have more news\nabout it."
