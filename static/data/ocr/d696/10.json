The\nprogram schedule does not intrigue me at all. If you\nbelieve we will hold an Important meeting I will attend\nto work with you and the committee. Let me know as soon\nas possible whether you want to hold a meeting.\nSorry this is so long, but you brought up a lot of\npoints that I believe are critical.\nSincerely,\nDETROIT EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION FOUNDATION\nFranklin 0.
