I want to\nthank Flem Messer and Larry Myers for helping\nwith this program, and also everyone else\nthat is helping. I hope we can have Carolyn\nStevens or Tena Evans for our teacher if\nthey get this program in. I also hope our\nCounty Judge Henry Stumbo, will make us a\nroad so we won't have to wade the creek. We\nwould sure appreciate it. We took colds\nand had to be out of school because we had\nto wade the creek about two weeks ago. We\ngot behind in our lessons.\"\nThat's all there is to that story, but the sim¬\nplicity of those words is moving. These children\nstun the eye of anyone who has ever seen them in\ntheir \"natural setting.\" The hardships they en¬\ndure every day of their lives is justification\nenough for any effort.\nWhat Martha Ann did not tell was that she must\nwade that creek four or five times, before she\nreaches her one-room school, and the same number\nof times to get back home. What she does not tell"
