You may recall that about a year\nago at this time I visited you in Urbana to discuss, among\nother things, the possibility of your distributing “Report\nIn Europe\",\nThere has been considerable renewed interest in the project\nto the extent that I have formed a company, John Hamilton &\nAssociates, in Chicago, The l£ minute documentary presenta¬\ntion of news will be done in Europe and distributed from here,\nbut it will be a commercial deal aiming for the small independent\nstations.\nMy reason in writing you at this time is to request any informa¬\ntion or brochures you may have on Dr, Milton Meyers’ \"Voice\nof Europe\", I remember that this program was carried by\nuniversity stations and had a kind of mixed reception. Any\ncomments and suggestions you will care to make will be greatly\nappreciated. I am sure that you will appreciate this is\nquite a venturel\njhl/s"
