C. 20036\nDear Ken:\nIn response to your memo of June 27,* let me fi„rsfc congratulate you on \\\nyour recent appointment and suggest that whatever assistance I may\nprovide in your worthy campaign is yours for the asking.\nWKAR has one series of programs on the road and one in the formative\nstages which excites us. Two months ago, we learned that the conven¬\ntional news outlets in Lansing-East Lansing and surrounding areas had\nnot been covering the efforts of the poor to campaign locally and nation¬\nally to raise money for'legislative petitions or to facilitate communica¬\ntion between the poor of the community and the remainder of the community.\nIn fact, further examination of the problem revealed that neither newsr\npapers nor the broadcast stations in the mid-Michigan area covered any\nnews or efforts of the disadvantaged.\nContact with spokesmen for the disadvantaged resulted in a program series\n(one-half hour weekly, minimum) broadcast once on each of our stations\n(AM & FM) which provides continuing examination and dissemination of in¬\nformation about the problems of the disadvantaged in our coverage area\nand the implications of the solutions. Initial efforts by WKAR have been\nwell-received by the disadvantaged and advantaged alike. One spokesman\nfor the poor stated, \"For the first time we have the opportunity to say\nsomething with the knowledge that we'll be heard!\""
