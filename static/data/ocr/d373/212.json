The service of your station to the\npublic interest in terms of what the critical interests of your\ncountry are at this time.\nThe black child is put into the classroom surrounded by print\nmaterials that he cannot read, given tasks that he cannot do and that\nhave little meaning to his real world, and talked at by white faces\nin suits and ties that drive out of the ghetto in cars every afternoon\nto a different society. These are conditions of Kafkaesque terror for\nany child; they are unreal, they have no positive meaning, and it is\n\\\nincredible that anybody can be expected to .learn anything under them.\nIt is no accident that in 1967 the U.S. Commission on Civil\nRights reported that not a single compensatory, educational program in\nthe United States has been successful.\nAll children, today, including and maybe especially the ghetto\nchild, live in an aural and visual world. Yet, virtually every educa¬\ntion program in the country is rooted in the print world of fifty\nyears ago. How can we expect any child to learn when we continue to\nuse nineteenth century methods and techniques to try to solve the\neducation problems that are part of the twentieth century revolutions\nof energy, transportation and--especially--communications?\nThe same is true for the adult in the inner-city. There has been\nno meaningful communication. ■"
