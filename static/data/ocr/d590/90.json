Hull called upon the\norganization to raise its sights and become a more constructive force in\neducation if it were to deserve support as a genuinely educational service*\nThe trade press at that time carried .conjectures, as to whether the\norganization would be able to survive tbpd^status quo\" and the \"progressive\"\nforces.\nBy a margin which was not as great as we would wish, the\nassociation voted to support new directions for the HA®, and to seek Foun»\ndation support to assist in their achievement*\nIt also voted to request the reservation of television channels\nfor education* In the ensuing few years, the NAEB was able to rally the\nsupport of other organizations for this effort, which culminated first, in\nthe formation of the Joint Council on Educational Television, of which Mr*\nHull was the first Executive Director; and secondly in the actual\nallocation for education of 257 channels in the TV spectrum*\nThanks to tfaB efforts of Dean Wilbur Schramm of the University\nof Illinois, assisting the NAEB, funds were secured from the Rockefeller\nFoundation to hold the 19^9 Seminar mentioned above*\nAt the time of this Seminar in spite of the allocation of JM\nfrequencies for education, there was a growing and sober recognition of\nthe fact that, like AM radio, HI might well again be \"the light that failed*\"\nIf the new stations, and the gradual resurgence of educational broadcasting\nin the U* S.^were to be soundly based, it was apparent that firmer inte«\ngration of educational broadcasting facilities into the total educational\nstructure of the educational institutions which owned and operated them."
