Stone\nManager\nStation KCTS-TV\nUniversity of Washington\nSeattle, Washington\nDear Loren:\nI am delighted to learn that your upset was not serious. You may have\ngot your tnsldes twisted, but you always have your head on straight!\nConsequently I was rather dismayed when I arrived and found that you\nwould not be available for the Board meeting. I counted on you heavily\nto lay the groundwork for the discussion of the NAEB-NETRC relationship.\nHowever, I survived this handicap and It conditioned me a bit for the\nsecond blow. On the eve of the House hearings. Bob Schenkan had,\nwhat was first reported to be, a heart attack. Since he was scheduled\nto arrive In Washington to steer the political activity during these three\ndays, this was a highly unfortunate circumstance. Bob's trouble turned\nout to be less grave than at first diagnosed. Evidently he had just overÂ¬\nworked to the point of exaustion and collapsed.\nAnyway, She board meeting went off rather well. We cleared the air\nwith reference to the Channel 12 situation and reestablished friendly\nrelations with the Philadelphia branch. Nothtng conclusive came from\nthe discussion over the MAEB-NETRC letter of agreement. X do believe,\nhowever, that we have laid the groundwork for a fruitful outcome at\nColumbus.\nSomehow, In the midst of the hearings, I will manage to dictate an account\nof the meeting to distribute to the Board so that you will have more details.\nCordially yours.\nWGHjrkf\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident"
