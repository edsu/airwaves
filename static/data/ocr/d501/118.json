  "text": "-!*-\nIll, (continued)\n\"In re the \"American Language\" series, we have a specialist on that here\nat Minnesota — Harold Allen, He did a nice series for us last Spring\non \"The Language of the Upper Midwest,\" but his knowledge extends to all\nareas of the United States, His radio presentation is straightforward —\nnot sensational, but good,\"\nIV. From Harry Lamb, WDTS\n\"At Harry Skornia^s suggestion of November 2 that we write to you about\nwhat we need and want, please refer to the recommendations of the In-\nSchool Committee of the Third Allerton Seminar wherein I report my conw\nmittee»s recommendations for a series of programs. The second program.\nOur Common Heritage, anticipates Vogl*s recommendation for a \"sectional\nsurvey of our country,\" and the program American Neighbors anticipates\nhis recommendation for a series on both American and European history.\n\"Vogl probably hasnft read the Second Allerton Seminar, so his voice\ncoming out of Iowa reinforces what my committee thought were pretty\ngood ideas two years ago, and independently.\"\nV. From Marguerite Fleming, KSLH\n\"I think the attached list of recommendations still holds.\n\"I am also including requests, reactions and inquiries concerning lan¬\nguage series for elementary grades.\"\n(Bob: I am attaching original of these materials, making no copy. They\ninclude \"Recommendations of the Third Allerton Seminar,\" materials on\n\"Visitons Mimi\" and other materials on languages by radio.) H.J.S.\ncp"
