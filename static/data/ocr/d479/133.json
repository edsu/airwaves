In\na broad general way, the hope was to discover ways to employ radio, TV and other\npowerful mass media to strengthen rather than to weaken the position of the indi¬\nvidual in a democratic society. Could the mass communication ’’gimmicks” that are\naccused of creating a mass mind work instead to develop strong, independent think¬\ning citizens of a free society? (The answer to this question was a resounding\n”Yes.”)\nMore specifically, the experiment sought information and answers to questions\nwhich would be valuable in future, more extensive attempts to tie group discussion\nand mass media together.\n1. Could and would radio and newspaper - two of the most powerful means of\nmass communication - work together in a joint educational program?\n2. Would people form discussion groups on their own initiative to read the\nnewspaper articles and listen to the programs?\n3. If so, what kinds of people would take the lead? What kinds of people\nwould come and where would they meet? Vlfhat different organizational approaches to\nforming groups would turn up?\n4. Would the groups formed last the full nine weeks or wither away after the\ninitial excitement died down?\n5. What kinds of discussions would these groups hold, lacking trained lead¬\ners? Would quality of the discussion have to be sacrificed in order to achieve\nQuantity? (The assumption was that this would be true; the results were a happy\ncontradiction.)\nSCENE OF THE EXPERIMENT\nThe area chosen for the experiment was the city of San Bernardino, California,\nand the surrounding towns and countryside in the San Bernardino Valley.
