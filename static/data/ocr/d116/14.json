I vote a hearty \"aye\"\nto his suggestion.\nYou will be interested to hear that UC/'-FM was voted\nmembership in the Alabama Broadcasters Association this past\nweek-end at the annual Spring meeting of that group. Further¬\nmore, I was elected Secretary-Treasurer of the organization.\nThis latter deal means a lot of extra work for me, but it is\nvery gratifying in that we have worked a long time toward the\nestablishment of the state headquarters on our campus and this\ncan be the beginning of the realization of those plans. That\nis not for publication, however.\nx My best to you always. Guess I’ll be seeing you at the\nColumbus meeting.\nSincerely,\nOmydon AusttaS, Mrector\nRadio Broadcasting Service®\nManager, TdOA-FM *\nGA/ns"
