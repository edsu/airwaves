  "text": "A redesign of the entire TV allocations system will be considered in\nthe near future.\nIn the rearrangement of available spectrum space, there are three\nmajor considerations:\n1. Adequate television broadcast service must be provided to\nthe entire nation.\n2. The inequity between VHF and UHF assignment must be\nrectified.\n3. Reasonable provisions must be made for present and future\nneeds of educational broadcasting.\nIn view of the well-organized and documented presentations which have\nbeen made on behalf of commercial broadcasting, industry, and the Armed\nServices, it is incumbent upon education to state clearly the present and\nfuture needs of education for space in the television spectrum. Such a\nstatement must be authoritatively documented. We must examine our present\nsituation and carefully project our future needs. We must know our needs,\nand be able to inform the government of those needs in valid terms while\nwe still have the opportunity.\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters, in cooperation\nwith the U. S. Office of Education, has undertaken the task of documenting\nthe needs of education for space in the television spectrum, and will make\nan engineering study to support channel allocation claims.\nThis is an enormous task. We need the help and cooperation of the\nentire educational community to conclude this effort successfully.\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS"
