There\nwill be a need for personnel to operate and program some two thousand new television\nstations, There will be an even greater need for programming resource.\nRow is the time for museums to get their feet wet. Row is the time to obtain\nas much experience as possible in exploiting the new medium.\nIf you do nothing more than merely display postcard reproductions of some of\nthe paintings hanging on your walls, and have one of your curators deliver a simple\ncommentary, you will at least be taking the first steps in extending the areas of\nyour marble halls to tens of thousands of homes. You will be raising the general\nlevel of taste by exposing to a mass audience something that is first rate."
