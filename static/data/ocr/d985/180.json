B. 2554\nTel Aviv, ISRAEL\nletter of November 25 regarding our NAEB TVBfitearch\nI assume by your request for “12 codes’* that you were under the impres¬\nsion that we issued a Fact Sheet each month and therefore desire copies\ncovering one complete year.\nOur Fact Sheets, which are an effort to digest and centralize available re¬\nsearch principally on the effectiveness of radio and television as instruc¬\ntional tools, are issued as a continuing series and at irregular intervals.\nSome times as many as thirty Fact Sheets are issued during the year. I\nhave enclosed a sample Fact Sheet and also an Index.\nThe Fact Sheets are priced at 104 each or $2.50 for all those issued during\nthe year. We can supply you with back issues for the years 1955, 1956,\nand 1957. As of January, 1958 the Fact Sheets will be incorporated into the\nNAEB Journal and will not longer be mimeographed. The subscription price\nat that time will be $4.00 per year.\nIf I have mistaken your request and you actually do desire any twelve\ncopies of our bulletin, please let me know and I will be most happy to\nsend them to you. May I suggest, however, that if this is the case you may\nprefer to select specific Fact Sheets from the titles given in the Index?\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gaea\nSecretary\nP. S. Iam also enclosing a list of our materials which we have available.\nPerhaps you will see something of interest listed.\n-^57\nJ"
