For this fee members\nreceive our monthly Newsletter: the various reports and surveys we pub¬\nlish periodically; services of our Placement Service, television engi¬\nneer, legal counsel, management consultant, etc.; plus the normal day-to-day\nservices, information, and advice that any national organization gives its\nmembers. X am attaching some brochures which will gire you idea of the\nfunctions and services of the Association.\nIn addition, Active members with radio stations may use the facilities of\nthe NAEB Radio Network upon payment of an annual assessment fee. The Net¬\nwork distributes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape record¬\ning, weekly, to members subscribing to its service. This fee is also based\non power (with the same power classifications as membership) and a new sta¬\ntion does not have to pay the full fee until the third year it is in the\nNetwork. The fees are:\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\n500.00\n300.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from\nNetwork Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A sta¬\ntion paying its full third-year rate is spying only a little over $2.00\nan hour for better than 400 hours of programming from the Network in a\nyear. This is about the most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf you have any further questions about the Association, we would be most\nhappy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHtjy\nEnclosures\n?, so -"
