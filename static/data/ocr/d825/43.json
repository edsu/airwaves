  "text": "A series of letters requesting information about avail¬\nable demonstration material was sent to some sixty people\nactive in the field of School Broadcasting Utilization. They\nwere asked to describe any utilization material they used and\ncould make available for national exchange or distribution.\nFrom their answers the following generalizations are made.\n. o • Very little material dealing with classroom\nutilization of educational broadcasts now exists.\n. . o The need for special utilization material is\ngreat, particularly demonstrations of outstand¬\ning broadcasts and their classroom use.\n. „ . There are many competent people available to\ndevelop information or demonstration material.\nSome of these people have worked extensively\nIn the utilization field.\n. o . Few people have the time or money to develop\ntheir ideas even for their own local use.\no o o Several organizations other than the NAEB are\ninterested In the field of utilization, but\neach organization is developing material pri¬\nmarily for use by their members.\n- . . A pilot kit of demonstration material is needed\nto illustrate the proposed service and could be\ndeveloped by the St. Louis Public School FM Radio\nStation staff.\n« . . There is an immediate need for a centralized\nlibrary of examples of outstanding school\nprograms."
