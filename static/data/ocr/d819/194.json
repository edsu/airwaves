U1H1C,\nMr. Frank Schooley\nStation WILL-AM-FM-TV\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nI have been looking over my calendar relative to that\nvisit I want to pay to Urbana in the middle of November.\nI could come any day of the week beginning November 12,\nalthough as things are now shaping up, it would be a little\nbetter if I came down on the 15th and 16th, rather than\nearlier. Or, I could come the beginning of the following\nweek, the 19th, although we shall certainly want to arrange\nthings so that all of us will be free to be with our families\non the afternoon of the 21st in order to get ready for\nThanksgiving on the 22nd.\nI am sending a carbon of this to Harry suggesting that\nyou and he confer together and let me know the best date.\nIncidentally, Monday the 12th will not be a holiday at\nthe University of Minnesota. If it is a holiday in Illinois\n(on account of Veterans Day coming on Sunday), that would be\na good reason for avoiding Monday from your point of view.\nWith best personal regards,\nYours sincerely\nBurton Paulu\nDirector of Region b\nBP: It"
