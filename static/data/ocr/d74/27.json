Participants will arrive Sunday afternoon,\nthe 16th. Morning and afternoon sessions will be held on Monday, Tuesday,\nand Wednesday and the seminar will close about 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday the\n19th As has been the case with past seminars, it is anticipated that most parti¬\ncipants will want to stay over on Wednesday night and depart on Thursday morning.\nThere will be no formal evening sessions, thus giving participants time for in¬\nformal sessions and discussions.\nThe NAEB will pay your living expenses (room and board) while you are at the\nseminar and rooms will be provided in University of Wisconsin housing, with\nmeals being eaten in the dining room.
