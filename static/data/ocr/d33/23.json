The\nvarious reasons for increased expenditures are indicated in the proper footnotes below.\nAfter accurately determining the breakdown of expenses for th8 first seven months, the\nexpenses for the last five months of the year vere carefully projected-, based on the\ncurrent expanded operation. Xt was deemed necessary to indicate probable maximum\nexpenditures, but it is hoped that further economy measures (as noted ;Sn (13), (14) and\n(16) below) will reduce the final annual expenditures considerably.\nPart of the cause for spending more than expected is the multiplicity of organizations\nrepresenting, or trying to create for themselves the status of representing, educational\ntelevision broadcastersa In the face of the demands for s^rvipes, and the number of\norganizations well-financed and eager to take over these services from NAEB, the NAEB\n1ms had to over-extend itself without delay, considering this a lesser evil than losing\nits status. The past nine months and the next eighteen months are and will be the\ncritical period in this regard, and the NAEB must be prepaid to take ovcir the providing\nof essential services now provided in whole or in part by ether, temporal', organizations.\nA large part of the anticipated deficit can be attributed to the big demand for new\ntaps which had to be resolved immediately and which couldn't be postponed if network\noperation was to be maintained at the present level. Approximately $7,00C was expended\nfor tape JLn \"the first sever* months, and, while it will help greatly, the $3,000 ear¬\nmarked for tap© in the additional grant will only partly alleviate the situation.\nXt should be pointed out that Radio Station WILL and the Division of Communications at\nthe University of Illinois have been doing everything within their power to help the\nNAEB avoid additional expense. Frank Schooley, Manager of VXLL, has turned over\nadditional office space to the NAEB, n&S WILL is buying approximately $1000 worth of\nshelving for the NAEB tape network to use for badly needed tape storage anc filing space.\nIn addition to this,member stations are trying to help the over-all situation by donating\ntapes to the network. This, of course, is in addition to th« payment of their network\nassessment fees.\nIncludes Workman® s Compensation and Retirement payments fox all salaried employees.\nPart of the increase in salaries and wages is due to the large labor turn-over at NAEB\n(terminal leaves, over-lapping of old and new employees, so that procedures can be\nproperly learned, etc.) It is generally accepted in business tint a large turn-over\nin labor force increases costs. Ihe NAEB is faced with the same problem that faces all\neducational institutions in the matter of not being able to compete with private business\nin the matter of salaries and wages.\nIncludes $2,950.83 salary (including above-mentioned payments for Associate Director for\nfour and one-half months (February 15 - Juno), leaving $2,049:17 carried over to next\nfiscal year, at $7,868.88 rate ($7,200.00 salary; $560.88*retirefaont; $108.00 'Workman0 s\nCompensation). Some personnel was also added to handle the approximately 60% increase in\nHeadquarters and Network duplication, shipping and correspondence load as compared to\nlast year."
