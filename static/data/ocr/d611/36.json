  "text": "3\nAct should not provide some reasonable assurance of non-discriminatory\npractices by means of a simple posting requirement. The Commission\nshould not, however, impose any such requirement which amounts to\nduplication of efforts already under the aegis of other Federal or\nState agencies. To the extent that the Commission’s posting re¬\nquirement would take into account the posting provisions of other\napplicable statutes, the NAEB would have no objection to the proposed\nposting rule.\n4. The Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rule Making also\nsuggests that a similar notice may be required to be placed in bold\ntype on the employment application, in order to inform the prospective\nemployee that discrimination is prohibited and that any person, with\ngrounds to believe that he or she has been discriminated against, should\nnotify the Federal Communications Commission. The NAEB does not be¬\nlieve that a specific notice on employment application forms is neces¬\nsary. Some broadcast stations, particularly smaller stations, do not\nhave official application forms. Particularly with respect to educa¬\ntional broadcast stations, the additional requirement of establishing\nofficial application forms, or modifying existing forms, could prove\na substantial financial burden for stations traditionally faced with\nextremely tight budgets. The Commission’s proposal appears to place\nan undue importance upon the procedural details of non-discrimination,\nwhen the proper focus in all instances should be the actual practices\nof the station. While responsible broadcasters would not oppose the\nprinciples of non-discrimination in hiring situations, there are legiti¬\nmate reasons why broadcasters, and especially educational broadcasters,\ncould be concerned about the additional burdens of paper-work which\nCommission proposals of this nature usually generate."
