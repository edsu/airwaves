Mem¬\nbership on the Planning Committees rotates, as do the Chairmanships. Staff\nwriters at Station KSLH are assigned by the Station Director, who receives the\nprogram requests from the Planning Committees, and fits the suggestions from\nall the Committees into a workable schedule of broadcasts. Committees often\nsuggest many more series than can be used in one school year and some may be held\nover and used at a later time.\nA Program Co-ordinator from the station sits in on all the main Planning\nCommittee meetings to guide thinking along general radio-wise lines, and to\nadvise on matters of production practicality. The writer may then work with\nthe Co-ordinator, directly with members of the Committee, or with both. The\nCommittee is always available for further consultation at the writer*s request.\nThe afternoon session on June 9th was led by Mss Betty Girling, who ap¬\nproached the problem of organizing material from a content and format point of\nview. Ideas, she felt, may come from teachers, from the station staff, or from\nmembers of the community. A station gets an idea or hears of one; realizes a\nneed, or discovers one. In both cases, the problem may be stated as: \"How do\nyou put flesh and bone on a dream?\"\nSuggestions Miss Girling offered on this point, particularly when it in¬\nvolved a new area, were:\n1) Spread out, get other concepts, approach your problem from many angles\nbefore you settle on one final idea.\n2) Don*t get stuck on approach or bogged down in a mire of ideas. Decide\non what seems best for the child.\n3) Base your decision as to approach on the answer to the all-important\nquestion: \"What is the series supposed to do?\""
