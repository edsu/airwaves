Did not address us, but\nSteetle (and Morris). Did talk to me in Chicago yesterday. I\nchatted with Morris first. Suggested to Mitchell that we»d be\nglad to correct any inaccuracies or wrong deductions to our\nofficers, bu^suggested, since quotes seemed authenticated that\nwe not get jSfto t^o wide distribution or it would become worse\nrather than better. Keeping in touch with Cohn and Morris. Will\nkeep you inforaed.\n2) If NAEB is to be active before the FCC on multiplex and other\nissues, I need guidance. Dp to the present, KAEB reactions\nseem conflicting, so I’ve done nothing but request that Cohn\nand Marks watch and report to us. I believe our AM-TV-FM\nmembers-status makes a unified \"NAEB Stand\" on this very difficult.\nDo you favor the proposed multiplexing proposal?\n3) Next couple of weeks I’ll be out of town most of time. Office can\nalways reach me (Chicago March 5 (Hewburn) and 9 ( Griffiths).)\nEast Lansing March 14-17; Battle Creek March 18 at Van Duyn\ninvitation.\nV\n4) DAVI Audio-Visual Members very interested in our albums. Also\ncontinuing discussion, with them, of duplication possibilities,\nif and when we have facilities, and if and when their project is\nfurther clarified. Rather nebulous yet.\n5) Re: New York Monitoring Study. Mr. Remmers says that the results are\ncoming out of the Statistical Bureau at Purdue in \"great gobs\"\nHe hopes to have a preliminary report by next month."
