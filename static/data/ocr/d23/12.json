  "text": "proposed amendment prohibits such affirmative misrepresentation;\nthat the possibility of deliberate deception is remote since it\nwould not work to a stations advantage to mislead its audience into\nbelieving recorded urogram material is live; that, in any case, the\nCommission could take appropriate action if any such attempt to mis¬\nlead might be made; and that the few occasions where such an attempt\nmight be made would be outweighed by the elimination of repetitious\nannouncements which have nd affirmative value* It is claimed that\nwith the increased use of recorded programming and the trend to small\nprogram blocks in radio, the number of recorded announcements required\nto be made each day has increased to the point Where their effectiveness\nis lost. It is urged that. both the public and the broadcasting industry\nwill be served by the elimination of announcements where the public1 s\nknowledge whether the program is recorded does not affect the value of\nthe program or make any difference as a matter of public interest, con¬\nvenience or necessity; that such announcements serve only -to cause •\nrepetitious interruptions of program continuity and program inbalance;\nthat they are both an annoyance and a distraction to* the listener or\nviewer and a costly and unnecessary burden on broadcast stations, and\nthat they consume broadcast time which can be used by the station and\nthe public to better advantage*\nOthers supporting the proposed amendments claim that\nit is inconsistent to relax the present rules to the extent of not\nrequiring mechanical recordation announcements with respect to back¬\nground music in programs and programs of less than one minute duration —\nthus indicating that the Commission is not concerned whether the public\nis aware that such programs or components thereof are live or transcribed—\nand, on the other hand, to require identification of all other forms of\nmechanically recorded program material* It is likewise claimed that there\nappears to be no justifiable reason for exempting a station because of\ndaylight saving time differentials from announcement requirements with\nrespect to network programs received on a delayed basis, except for\nannouncements once or twice a day, and, on the other hand, requiring\na neighboring station in standard time to announce as mechanically\nreproduced each program broadcast on a delayed basis for other reasons*\nSome parties point out that only the broadcaster is now required to\nlabel his material as •‘transcribed’1; that other competitive services,\nsuch as; Iviuzak, the juke box, the home phonograph, etc*, which the\nCommission does not regulate, are not bannered by mechanical reproduction\nidentification requirements; that newspapers, wire services,, foreign\ncorrespondence, etc*, frequently delay the release of material via\npress and air ;and that such material is often treated as not having\nHappened until released, and that the delay between creation and\nrelease of material by such services does not adversely affect either\ntne public interest nor public acceptance of the material*"
