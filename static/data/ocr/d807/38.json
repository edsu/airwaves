Hill\nDATE: October 3, 1962\nWe would like for your four gentlemen to serve as the Resolutions ccanmittee at our\nforthcoming convention in Philadelphia with Keith serving as chairman.\nlast year we adopted a new \"philosophy** about convention resolutions. In the past,\n99% of our resolutions had been of the \"thank you’* sort, with resolutions thanking\nthe hotel, the host committee, the chamber of commerce, etc. last year, however\nwe decided that the membership should consider resolutions which would have some\"\nreal meaning and which would reflect the membership's attitude on certain important\nmatters. This resulted in the resolutions you'll find on the attached sheet. In\naddition, the committee merely added a recommendation (which was also approved by\nthe membership) that the Secretary of the Board write \"thank you\" letters to the\nhotel, etc.\nNaturally, you fellows TitLII have ideas about suitable resolutions which you will\nwant to present to the membership (your report will be due at the final business\nsession Wsdnesday afternoon). In addition, at the opening business session on\nMonday, Bill will suggest that any members having ideas for resolutions should\ntransmit them to members of the ccanmittee (which he will also announce at that time).\nI have reserved room 458 for a committee meeting for your group, 8:30-9:30 Tuesday\nmorning - the time set aside for regular committee meetings. Of course, you may\nwell need more time, but I believe the convention schedule will permit you to get\ntogether at other times, too.\nSince all of you have sent in advance registration cards, I presume there will be\nno reason why you can't serve, but if, for some reason, you cannot, please let me\nknow by return airmail. And thank you in advance for accepting this important assign¬\nment.\nHEH/mlm\ncc: William G. Harley\nEnd."
