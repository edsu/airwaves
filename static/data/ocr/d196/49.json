He finds gnawing doubts about American objectives and even\nAmerican motives. In many cases, distrust would not be too strong\na word.\nFor this particular American, this phenomenon is one of the most\nstriking and impressive aspects of the Italian political landscape.\nNever mind, for the moment, what the Communists and their left\nSocialist allies say about us; theirs is the same old warmed-over\niioscow-dominform hash, with, to be sure, a few peculiarly Italian\nJournalistic and x»h rhetorical touches here and there.\nAnd never mind what Italy*s new and ever-bolder Fascists are\nsaying about America, though, as I tried to indicate in a previous\nletter, what they say is not unimportant in the present Italian\npolitical situation.\nwhat ought to concern us is what our friends are saying; the\npeople on whom rest the hopes for the survival and strengthening of\nItaly * s democracy; the people who have supported our policies in the\npast and wish to support us in the future.\nThese are the Italians who find their political outlets in the\nparties of the Center and moderate Left; the parties that made up\nthe old coalition of former Premier Ale id e de Casper! for most of these\npostwar years j the Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, Republicans\nand Liberals."
