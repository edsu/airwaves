The network has served\neducational stations well for many years. The CPB\nfunds will allow a marked improvement. Our efforts\nwill be directed toward the most appropriate utili¬\nzation of the funds so that prime benefit will accrue\nfor the Individual stations and the listeners they\nserve.\nWe are looking forward to the completion of the Public\nRadio Study. NER trusts that the study will give us\nguidance and direction for the future development of\nradio.\nThere seems to be growing concern among radio station\nmanagers regarding an interconnection for radio net¬\nworking among educational stations. The success 6f\nthe ETV network has clearly whetted the appetites of\nthe radio stations for a like service.\nI am delighted to work with Don Quayle in the admin¬\nistration of the NERN grant. Appropriate reports\nwill be submitted to CPB at the conclusion of the\nproject.\nSincerely,\nRAM: lkl\ncc: William G. Harley\nRobert A. Mott"
