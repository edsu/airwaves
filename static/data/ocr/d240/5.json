Do you know\nanyone who would, willingly? Perhaps so, but you first need the answers to a lot\nof questions: Who did it? What is he to me? Why did he? In other words, you\nwould agree only if the circumstances made it meaningful for you to do it?\nAmong the Tlingit Indians along the coast of Alaska, men do give up their\nlives willingly by prearrangement. Sounds like an odd custom, doesn't it? It is\none of the thousands of \"Believe-it-or-not\" items that anthropologists bring home\nfrom the exotic peoples who live in distant parts of the world. Thought of in this\nway, it seems an oddity—brutal or perhaps even disgusting. The customs of strange\npeople always seem odd and often seem bad, when we learn about them^ as isolated\npractices or ideas. But when we appreciate the circumstances under which they are\npracticed, the meanings and the involvements they have for the persons doing them,\nthey begin to make good sense.\nAnthropologists understand such behavior in terms of the culture of the\npeople. Culture as we use it here has nothing to do with the popular word that\nmeans something like refinement, as in the statement, \"He is a very cultured\ngentleman.\"\nFormal Definition\nHere is a formal definition: A culture is the pattern of life that is\nshared by a group of people, who have learned it as they grew up. Such a pat¬\ntern of life included not only customs, knowledge and behavior, but also the\nsystem of beliefs, the ideas about the world, attitudes toward other people,\nrelationships between people, and even the very feelings the persons have in\nspecial situations. It is tradition, handed down from the past though it is\nExperimental Discussion Program Subject to Revision\n7"
