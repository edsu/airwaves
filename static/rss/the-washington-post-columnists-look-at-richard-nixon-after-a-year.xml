They will discuss what they have seen in the more than a year that he's been in the White House. All these journalists comment on a number of aspects of the federal government, but all of them have at one time or another written about the president's performance. You will hear from Tom Braden, Frank Mankowitz, David Broder, Marquis W. Chiles, Roscoe and Jeffrey Drummond, Roland Evans, Joseph Kraft, Chalmers M. Roberts, William S. White, and satirist Art Buchwald.<br /><br />An online collection of early educational public radio content from the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB).]]></description><link>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/programs/the-washington-post-columnists-look-at-richard-nixon-after-a-year/</link><image><url>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/images/podcast.png</url><title>The Washington Post columnists look at Richard Nixon after a year</title><link>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/programs/the-washington-post-columnists-look-at-richard-nixon-after-a-year/</link></image><generator>RSS for Node</generator><lastBuildDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 17:35:36 GMT</lastBuildDate><atom:link href="https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/rss/the-washington-post-columnists-look-at-richard-nixon-after-a-year.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><managingEditor><![CDATA[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]]></managingEditor><item><title><![CDATA[Twelve columnists take a look at Nixon]]></title><link>https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-028pgw5q/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-028pgw5q/</guid><enclosure url="https://mith-uta.s3.amazonaws.com/data/audio/cpb-aacip-500-028pgw5q.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mp3"/><dc:creator>National Educational Radio Network</dc:creator><dc:subject>United States--Politics and government--20th century</dc:subject></item></channel></rss>
