And finally, if we turn to endeavors that\nHAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, PARTICULARLY\nsince World War Two, to help the Negro in his employ\nMENT SITUATION, WE SHOULD HAVE A REASONABLY ROUNDED\nBRIEF VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WE’RE TRYING TO TACKLE.\nFollowing your suggestion then, Lou, I don’t think 1\nCOULD DO MUCH BETTER'THAN TO TURN, ONCE AGAIN, TO Dr\nRayford W. Logan, Professor of History at Howard\nUniversity, who discusses significant features of th\nNegro’s labor situation since the end of the Civil\n\"Var.\nLabor had not in this period immediately after the\nCivil War achieved the strong position which it now\nhas. The National Labor Union debated from 1866 to\n186.9 what it should do with this new contingent of\nworkers. Looking back we would say that White worke\nSHOULD HAVE WELCOMED AN IMPLEMENT IN THE FORM OF NEW\nWORKERS, EVEN THOUGH THEY BE 3LACK, IN THEIR STRUGG'\nFOR BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS, HIGHER SALARIES FOR\nworking men.
