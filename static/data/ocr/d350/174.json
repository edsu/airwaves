Waldo Abbot\nwucs:\nUniversity of Fdchigan\nnn Arbor, Michigan\nbear Waldos\nPleasÂ© give the enclosed your immediate attention and give us\nyour most careful and considered reaction to the problems we pose here.\nVery frankly, we are in bad graces with both Foundations and this\nreplacement is a matter of great significance. It has got to be the\nright man as far as the Foundations are concerned and as far as the\norganization itself is concerned. A great deal hinges on it#\nI shall appoint two members, other than myself, to this Committee.\nWe will meet at Urban a and spend what time is necessary, three, four,\nor five days, bringing this deal to a conclusion. The problem is to\nget someone \\tio can go on to the job by the first of October so he can\nspend a month or six weeks on the job before Jim has to leave. This\nwill assure a continuity of effective operation. So, will you please\ngive me your suggestions for the composition of this Committee. Naturally,\nI will keep the suggestions confidential.\n2he Ames meeting was highly successful. Sorry you were not there.\nI shall look forward to hearing from you in the very near future.\nSincerely,\nQrayuon Ausmus, Director\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nVice-President, NAEB"
