Skornia,\nNAEB - 14 Gregory Hall,\nUKBANA, Ill.\nAddress reply tos\nMARSHALL McLUHAN\nPROJECT DIRECTOR\n96 Saint Joseph Street\nToronto 5, Ontario, Canada\nDear Harry:\nA very fruitful day, yesterday. Called Sam Becker\nwho had just been through my materials about the High\nSchool visit. He suggested I call Wanda Mitchell, in\nEvenston, Illinois, and within five minutes of speaking\nto him she was enthusiastically arranging an Evenston\nschedule for me. Sam mentioned also that she was an\nAdvisor to the Washington Committee so that I look\nforward to an opportunity to explain ny media approach\nto her so that she may inoculate them.\nLater in the day, I managed to reach Ethel Tine her\nin Detroit. She is in charge of the Department of\nInstructional Improvement of all Detroit Schools and\nhas, herself, been teaching the media to High School\nEnglish classes for many years. She is proceeding, at\nonce, to give me a diversified set of schools and a\nschedule for immediate action. I can do more than one\nat a time, but the big advantage is that I can get on\nwith those videos at the same time with Jack Ellery*\nLee Dreyfus and Bob Schafer. So I shall probably stay\naround Detroit for a two or three week stretch in Febru¬\nary. As soon as the Tincher itinerary and program\narrives, I shall probably take it to Washington to dis¬\ncuss with Siebert.\n(One thing we had not anticipated was that I could\npersonally handle the media tests in the High Schools.\nYou can see that this has reduced the time factor\nenormously. When the videos are ready, it will be quite\nfeasible to send a written syllabus to accompany it, or\nthem. The present notion is to have a panel dialogue\ngoing as part of the sound-track on the video.\ncontinued."
