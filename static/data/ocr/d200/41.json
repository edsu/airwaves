Harley\nPresident, NAEB\n1346 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nI note the Educational Media Council has its next meeting scheduled for\nthe Washington area on October 10, 11, 12. This conflicts with a local\nevent called by the State Department of Public Instruction on adult edu¬\ncation and the Ohio State ETV Network plan.\nMy record of attending EMC sessions is very bad, and frankly ! feel guilty\nabout it. If you for some reason believe l should remain on EMC as an\nNAEB representative with Harold Hill or someone attending in my absence,\nokay. Unless, however, there is some compelling reason it would probably\nbe more fair to put a guy on the EMC who could make the meetings regular¬\nly and contribute more than I*ve been able to do. Best.\nSincerely\nR\nP.S. The HEW-NAEB meeting on the 15th of August was first-rate l thought.\nKessler was extremely pleased. In amy event he met realism ahead of\ntime in the case of at least two operators.\nRBH:rc\nTeaching Aids Laboratory • Office of Seminars and Workshops • Ohio School o/ the Air • Video Recording • WOSU—WOSU-FM—WOSU-TV • Closed Circuit TV"
