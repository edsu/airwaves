It\nis our feeling that some such careful consideration would be indicated to insure\nacceptability and to help avoid the pitfalls which any such pioneer effort is likely\nto encounter. Such a meeting would of course precede any final decision by the\n^undation on this proposal, and would also affect the final form in which it would\nbe submitted.\nIn view of our concern with, and interest in, this problem area, it was\nfelt desirable to present the project in this preliminary draft outline foruC for\nwhatever discussion and further preparation, investigation, or explanation may\nbe indicated 6\nOne of the other problems which might be explore^in such a preliminary\nmeeting as is suggested is this: although all of the D^ans of Education so far con¬\nsulted are sympathetic to such a proposal as thi&Axi general terms, we sometimes\nhave the uneasy feeling that many other deans and administrators are not aware of\npresent deficiencies in the communicatipns systems of their own schools, or in\ntheir own concepts» We also feel tl>4t many are not aware of the tremendous dif¬\nference which is possible between traditional classroom instruction (at whatever\nlevel) and the new patterns of organization which the full potential of television\nand radio, properly understood and viewed, make possible.\nFor, humblej&s we are in the face of this problem, we feel that there is a\nmutual process of ■''education*• needed, to which we£ as well as they, can make\nsignificant contributions. Beginning, therefore, with a few such liberally-oriented\nDeans ar^d other officers, we believe that the prospects of developing a workable\nunderstanding of both the need, and the manner of meeting it, will be greatly improved."
