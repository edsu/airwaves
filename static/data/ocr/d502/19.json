I will put\nthem down as they come to me without any attempt to polish or worry about\nterminology. I will try to give you th* facts, mention the source* and you,\nWalter and I can meet and discuss this further. I will send a copy to Skornia\nand you can decide whether a copy should go to Day, Sener, Woods and Schwartavalder\nI am sure you agree that this ought to be confidential until we decide how to\ntreat the whole subject .\nNow here are the factsi\nBefore I reached Miami, 1 knew the St. Louis picture from personal contact so\nthat when I reached Phoenix I used that as a base for my discussions with Sener,\nDay, Schwartzwalder and Woods.\nMeeting. in-Miami\nFive days was hardly sufficient time. I met with Messrs. Tracy, Walsh and\nHeller. I had a long conversation with Neal Haggarty, an outstanding labor\nman of California, who is a member of the San Francisco board and who designated\nBassett. Secretary of the Los Angeles Council, to serve as a member of the board\nMr. Tracy was interested and explained to me the past policies of IBEW — they\nare strong on local autonomy. The radio and television division have had\nspecial conditions. They have never had a policy for educational« non-commercial\nstations; but he said that he wanted to do all he could to help, and he asked\nthat I see Mr. Hardy, his radio-TV director. Had a long talk with Hardy\nyesterday and we have agreed to meet in New York or Washington on Wednesday\nor Thursday.\nI met with Dick Walsh, a close friend, who recognizee our problem and the need\nfor special consideration. Be was going to do all he could to get word to\nhis people in Pittsburgh to cooperate with us.\n♦I. A. is not involved in Sap Francisco, but is in LOs Angeles; the I.A. man\nis in charge of film there.\nThe difficult one will be St. Louis where the IA and IBEW have been battling\nfor years. While I haven1! any commitment on St. L^uis because I didn°t ask\nfor any, he recognizes that in the TV field the IBEW has had supremacy\nand therefore I am confident that if it comes to a showdown we will receive\nfavorable consideration.\n♦Skornia notes IATSE"
