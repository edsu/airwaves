  "text": "John H. Lerch\n-2-\noperational experience can fit into the needs of NAEB and where I best\nmight be used.\nI should like to state this rather bluntly if I may:\nanother reason I make this a tentative application—-I have never been\nso much the \"radio educationist\" concerned with academic theory;\nalthough I believe very strongly in the over-all excellent objectives of\nsuch an organization as NAEB, I act and respond well to an executive\natmosphere wherein responsibility and decisions are clear-cut functions\na °£^cers. It may be partly, because I come from a long line of\nindustrialists in Ohio, but I do feel this wayI For this reason, then,\nI ought to know more about the internal workings and structure\nof NAEB than I was able to learn in ray short visit*\nIf there is any initial interest on your part fn® this\n* etter and resume, you might tell me what this job will be like and we\ncan continue correspondence on it, and I shall be pleased to send in a\nmore complete dossier with recommendations, etc. Please note that\nmZ jl0*3 *n aa assistant program director carried a base salary\nof 57000 per annum with a tax-free cost of living allowance of $5,000*\nThe details of this job are inadequately set forth in the resume,\nand I will send a more detailed outline of my function there in\nsubsequent correspondence.\nLet me thank you for your interest and attention.\nCordially yours.\n/sf John H* Lerch"
