Ordinarily they would be mailed to only one location*\nIt may be necessary to hare some sent to different stations. We may find\nthat it would be best to send the entire order to this office, Wfe can\nexplore this detail further later on. In any case there would not be a\nneed for more than one copy to be mailed,\nI know you are busy but I would like to finalize this at our\naffiliates committee meeting the third week of September. I would appreÂ¬\nciate your reactions and/or alternate suggestions by then.\nBest regards,\nm\nDonald R. Quayle\nDirector of Radio Services\ncci Mr. Robertson\nMr. Harley"
