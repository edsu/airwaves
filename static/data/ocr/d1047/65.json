  "text": "PROPOSAL FOR A NATIONAL EFFORT BY THE CONGRESS\nOF PARENTS AND TEACHERS TO BRING EDUCATIONAL\nTELEVISION TO AMERICA\nAlthough educational television stations\nhave sprouted in many important areas of\nAmerica, many other areas of equal importance\nremain unserved. It seems to me this repre¬\nsents an opportunity, an obligation, and a\nchallenge for the National Congress of Parents\nand Teachers.\nAs a member of the Board of Directors of\nthe National Association of Educational Broad¬\ncasters, I have had an opportunity recently\nto discuss this problem with several nationaly-\nly-recognized leaders in the field of educational\nbroadcasting and I have found them unanimously\nagreed that if the National Congress were to engage\nin an all-out effort on behalf of a nationwide\nsystem of educational television stations that\nthe establishment of such a system would be\nvirtually assured.\nIt seems to me that this is a matter of\nsuch grave importance to the welfare of children\nand youth in home, school, and community that\nwe cannot afford to pass the opportunity by.\nIf you are interested in further comments\non the importance of educational television and\nthe possible, role of the National Congress in\nthis field, I will be happy to amplify my sug¬\ngestions ."
