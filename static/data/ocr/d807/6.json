I also feel that a call for resolutions\nshould be made at the first general meeting to allow time for expressions\nfrom the convention.\nI hope this covers everything. With no other responsibilities for the\nconvention, 1 did not feel that I could justify the travel cost in order to\ncarry out this single function. I will, therefore, be most grateful to Frank,\nMac, Keith and the rest of you for doing the job.\nGood luck and have a line convention.\ncc: Harold HiU\nat W ashington and Austin"
