C.\nDear Bill,\nLoren Stone has called our attention to the recent action of\nthe Full NAEB Board in which they authorized you to enter into\ncontracts for package productions of ETV programs.\nOfficially, WMVS feels that the matter of NAEB entering into such\ncontracts for ETV program production needs considerable research\nand study. We do not feel that there is sufficient need indi¬\ncated at this time for such service by NAEB. We are opposed in\nprinciple, and feel the matter should be given thorough study.\ni*\nI personally agree with Loren that the stations cannot afford\nto underwrite another program resource, and believe such work\nwould create a disservice to our present network.\nWill you please give this matter your consideration?\nWarmest personal regards\nOtto F.
