Com.\nIstanbul\nEXTRA-EUROPEAN AND MUSIC IN THE ORAL TRADITION\nThe most important event in this field since the Committee\nlast met has been the offer from the RAI of 6 programmes produced\nunder the overall title \"At the sources of music\" by Alain Danielou\nand Giorgio Nataletti. Very detailed documentation running into\n25 pages accompanied this offer which covered music from Persia,\nthe Middle East, India, Japan and Korea. Full details were sent\nout by the Administrative Office on the 25th of January under re¬\nference 68.123 and already there are indications of considerable\ninterest in this important offer.\nThe BRT announces details of 3 further long-playing records\nof African music which may be obtained upon application. The first\nof these, devoted to the Teda-Tibesti people of Chad has just\nappeared and two further disks, dedicated respectively to the Ankole\npeople of Uganda and the Bafia from the Federal Republic of Cameroun\nare foreseen. The Administrative Office has sent out a circular\nletter inviting applications for these records to be made directly\nto the BRT.\nFinally, under reference 68.461 of 5 March 19719 the Ad¬\nministrative Office sent out details of a vast collection of re¬\ncordings associated with the \"Theme of Water\". Exchange of these\nwill no doubt be getting under way shortly and should form a use¬\nful and valuable acquisition to members' Sound Archives."
