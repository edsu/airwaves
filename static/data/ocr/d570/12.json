  "text": "process is a phase-modulation principle, achieved by the use of two RCA 6671 tubes.\nThe power output of two tubes is 56 KW or more. Only a few watts of power is\nrequired to modulate them* compared to as much as 36 KW of audio power required\nto modulate the ordinary 50 KW AM transmitter* The unit cost is $1250* However*\ncomparing this again to the other high power stages of AM transmitters* usually one\nwould find as many as four of such tubes* So the cost of such an amplifier is much\nless* the operating cost is much less* the space required as well as the necessary\nassociated equipment is much less than that found hi other standard installations of\nthe paste It would seem as though this idea may well set a new standard. Reports\nare that the new ECA type BTA 50 â€œG transmitter will be on the market late this\nyear and will utilise this new modulation principle. Sn all probability 5 KW stations\nwill be able to purchase tubes of til is type and replace older equipment in the not\ntoo distant future. Tube life of this unit is considered very good. The filament\ncurrent requirement is much less than ordinary high power tubes similar in type.\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS:\nAnother item of considerable interest at the NARTB convention was the\nradio-communication systems on display. With the situation so many stations\nare experiencing with lack of communication facilities from remote to studio,\nradio communication equipment becomes a necessity for coordinating program\nservices and equipment line-ups. Several systems are available on the market,\nworking in the 25 to 26 megacycle range. The transmitters operate with a low\npower, of approximately 2 watts, and high gain reflectors are used to obtain\nmaximum service range. Rayetheon is marketing a highly portable combination\ntransmitter-receiver either for fixed or mobile use. If only one way communication"
