THEREFORE IF YOU THINK THESE\nDIFFERENCES CAN BE RECTIFIED ANO IF YOU THINK THAT WE\nCAN MAKE SOME REAL PROGRESS IN THIS SORT OF OISCUSSION\nI FOR ONE WOULD BE PERFECTLY WILLING TO COME TO CHICAGO\nON ANY DATE YOU 8UGGEST.\nAs A POSSIBLE TEMPORARY ALTERNATE, I WONDER IF\nIT WOULD BE WISE IF YOU ANO I WERE TO SIT DOWN AND TRY\nTO AT LEAST DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF\nTHOSE WHO WOULD 8E APT TO ATTEND AND LIST WH#T QUESTIONS\nSHOULD BE ANSWERED ANO WHAT BACKGROUND GIVEN.\nAlthough I’ve been away extensively this summer\nI AM CERTAIN THAT I WOULO WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A\noay’s junket Chicago way. Therefore, why not let me\nKNOW WHAT YOUR SCHEDULE FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST IS AND\nLET ME SEE IF I CAN’T DOVETAIL THAT WITH MY RATHER\nCOMPLICATED SCHEDULE HERE.\nIn REVIEWING THIS LETTER l RECOGNIZE THAT I HAVE\nPERHAPS OVERCOMPLICATED THE SITUATION. MAYBE THIS IS\nBECAUSE I AM SO CLOSE TO THE WOODS THAT I CAN*T SEE THE\nINDIVIDUAL TREES. I THINK, HOWEVER, THAT YOU KNOW ME\nWELL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT I HAVE BEEN VERBOSE, IF THIS IS\nTHE CASE. Drop ME a LINE AT YOUR CONVENIENCE AND LET*S\ntalk.\nSincerely,\nJames S, Miles\nDirector Raoio-TV"
