The discussions progressed effectively without trained leaders. It had\nnot been necessary to sacrifice quality for quantity.\n5. One or more group jpembers usually played the role of keeping the dis¬\ncussion on the general track. This was a spontaneous development, seldom con¬\nsciously directed.\nThe members exhibited a high degree of personal enjoyment. When queried as\nto their satisfaction, they were almost unanimous in their enthusiasm for the ex¬\nperience .\nGROUP DISINTEGRATION\nEleven groups that started failed to reach the finish line, ^imitations of\nbudget, time and energy prevented gathering data which would establish clearly the\nreasons for disintegration in each case. Very limited interviewing, however, rei-\nvealed the following causes:\n1. The block groups, as previously discussed, proved too weak a foundation\nto build on*. Of the four groups started, two broke up completely, and two were\nconverted to more natural \"friendship” groups.\n2. Competition of other activities in which people had previously engaged\nreasserted itself after the initial flush of excitement over the Experiment had\ndied down. Some people apparently found the weekly attendance too exacting in its\ndemands on their time. They preferred to watch TV, go to other meetings, or engage\nin other activities which previously had engrossed them.\n3. Poor radio reception in some areas where groups had organized discouraged\nthe group members after one or two meetings and they disbanded.\n4. One group broke up following the death of one of its leading members in a\ntragic airplane crash."
