This summary is being drawn to the attention of\nthe Programme Committee because it appears that the exchange is not at\npresent of much value to the participants and it should therefore be\neither altered or abandoned.\nThe main points in the replies to the questionnaire appear to be:\n(a) In each 1 round* of the exchange, each participant sends to each of\nthe others taking part a print of a short film, the cost of prints\nand airfreight being paid by the senders. The majority of the\nmembers taking part are using none, or very few, of the films\nreceived. Thus they are achieving very little for the costs in-"
