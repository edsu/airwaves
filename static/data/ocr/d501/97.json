Educational broadcasters, as\nfar as I know, have not been interested in pro¬\ngrams that primarily correct misconceptions.\nRather, they present informational programs in a\nstraightforward manner with a more positive\napproach.\nIn addition, a program such as this does\nnot seem to cover an area in which we have been\ninactive. My recommendation, therefore, is that\nwe do not consider this proposal at this time.\nWith all best wishes, I am\nBRB:jb\nCordially yours.\nBernard R.
