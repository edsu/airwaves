Because of the increasing use of television in education, and\nbecause of the many different aspects and problems in the planning, con¬\nstruction, and operation of educational installations, the FCC should\nestablish a department whose responsibilities would be devoted to the\nproblems of educational broadcasting, and point to point transmission for\neducational purposes.\n* Arrangements are currently under discussion for a supplementary report\nto be prepared by MEB on the potentials of satellite communications for\neducation."
