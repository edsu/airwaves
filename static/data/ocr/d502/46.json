Assn, of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois, 119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nMy dear Harry*\nI will see you in Columbus. Djr all means, get word out to the directors\nand anyone else you wish about a meeting while I am there. As a matter\nof fact, I was going to meet at dinner or lunch with the five fellows\nwhom I have been seeing* Dunn, 8mmt, Schvarzwaldsr, Wood, Goggin, you *\nand Ralph.\nI can understand why a lot of the guys would worry — and frankly,\nthey have reason to worry — not because of anything which we do but\nbecause they are assuming that you can live in the atomic age and deal\nwith the most developed form of communication but be completely isolated\nfrom any outside influence. Between us, the reason their worry is\nexaggerated is a) the major unions have so many other problems that they\nare not interested in going after the university educational radio TV\nstation and (b) they are located in areas off the beaten patho\nRest assured that in all my conversations with top level people\nwe never think in terms of a national contract. As a matter of fact, it\nwould louse up everything we are doing because we would have to decide\nwhom to deal with, etc., etc.\nThanks for haring my future financial interests in mind, I hope\nNAEB will raise the additional funds but so far a® Novik is concerned,,\nlet9s cross that bridge when we pet to it. Everything I have done so far,\nI have done oecause Steetle, Muller, and you thought the job ought to be done.\nBelieve it or not, I am much more optimistic about my accomplishments than\nI was when I started.\nSincerely yotirs.\n/s/ M. S. Novik"
