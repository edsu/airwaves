I hadn't set you two fellows down for jailbirds.\nNo, no| we are French prison commissioners; we are in your country\nchiefly to study your prisons and what do you call them, penitentiary?\nSo that building there is the penitentiary of Sing-Sing!\nDARK: QUIET AND OMINOUS\nWelcome, to Sing-Sing, gentlemen. How do you like our penitentiary?\nSir, Mr. Warden (how should I address you?)\nMr. Warden'll do fine. (THROWAWAY)\nThis word penitentiary; it interests us very much. These places you\nvery often seem to call penitentiaries, rather than prisons. Why is this?\nA prison is a place to shut a man up, to keep away from society; as a\nmenagerie shuts up a fierce tiger. Very well, a penitentiary is a place\nfor penitents; a place for a man to do penance; in other words, a place\nto reform him, and send him back to society, converted and improved.\nAnd by what means do you attempt this difficult task, Mr. Warden?\nWork; and silence.\nAlmost the Benedictine rule.\nI would know nothing about that, sir; as far as I am concerned this is\nthe rule of Mr. Elam Lynds, who was the first warden of Sing-Sing.\nSometimes we call it the Auburn system, because Mr. Lynds started\nthe system when it was at Auburn prison, upstate a piece. That was ten\nyears ago.\nAnd do you find this system works?"
