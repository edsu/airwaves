I advise you most seriously as a friend, and\nas his good friend, that he has never been able to speak the heart of\nhis message successfully to most professional media men, and he hates\ndetail, skipping all middle steps, as he generally does. He needs\npeople of proper temperament.\nI think NAEB has made a daring and fine decision. I ask you and\ncolleagues in NAEB to remember the original brilliance (which still\npersists) and to be prepared for Mac's ignorance and lack of concern\nfor most of the things we teach in our media courses. He could learn\nthem, but he doesn't care to, particularly, for the important thing\nis inherent form of the media, not control structure, content, audience,\netc.\nWhen the doubts arise in NAEB, perhaps you can be Mac's friend\nand translator. You're (NAEB) way ahead of your time in doing this.\nWith understanding Mac can perform beyond expectation, which is beyond\nthe thinking of most of us, by far. He can also be frustrated by the\nshoe clerks among us.\nAlso, he can be wrong in factual detail that you carry in your\nhip pockets. Forget it. Rely on his insight.\nHe's an artist, a poet â€” we need them in the media.\""
