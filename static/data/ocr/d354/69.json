The basic problem to be resolved was whether the Seminar should\nbe a \"How-to-Do-It\" workshop type of meeting, with emphasis on techniques of edu¬\ncational radio writing, or a \"refresher\" type of meeting, with emphasis on clari¬\nfication of the philosophy of educational scriptwriting, mutual inspiration through\nthe exchange of opinions and ideas, and discussion of the place of the writer in\neducation and in society.\nAnother point to be resolved was whether the assembled writers could, and\nshould, in the short span of four days, attempt any group writing or program plan¬\nning. The Allerton House Conference of 193>2 had gone on record as favoring the\ncreation of two program series under the aegis of NAEB, one on Canadian-American\nRelations, and one on Conservation of Natural and Human Resources. Some members\nof the staff thought it might be possible for some writers in attendance at the\nSeminar to meet in groups and discuss possible program ideas for either or both\nof these series^ others felt that the pressure of time would not permit it.\nWhen preliminary planning had resolved all points of difference except\nthese two issues, it was decided to turn to the twenty people who had been chosen\nby a special committee of the NAEB to attend the Seminar, and to the managers of\nthe stations which these people represented, (A list of Seminar participants may\nbe found in Appendix 1.) Accordingly, the station managers were asked to state\nwhat they hoped the writers they were sending to the Seminar would get out of it.\nThe writers were asked what they hoped to get out of the Seminar, and whether they\nfelt that working on either of these two program series, or on projects of their\nown, would be most desirable."
