However* the pres=»\nent limitations of our staff and the heavy pressure which we are under to\ncomplete certain projects for the United States Information Agency for\noverseas distribution makes it most difficult at this time to undertake\nany work towards such a project,, Additionally * there is a possibility\nthat we may in the very near future have to begin work on additional rec¬\nords for issuance by the Library which would absorb our full time. Since\nthe folklore program* as conceived by you* is not one which is essentially\na timely matter* it would I think be most interesting to consider it again *-\nat some date in the future* possibly in the late summer of next year,, 7\nIn our consideration of the project* it will be necessary for us\nto have more detailed information from you about the number of programs*\ntheir length and the type of material you wish included® Since the work\nwould be in addition to our normal workload* it would be necessary for us\no prepare a budget in terns of the engineers* time* as well as cost of\naterials and preparation of the programs0 (The Recording Laboratory op~\nrates on a revolving fund and is not supported by government appropria¬\nted funds) o We would be pl©ased to prepare a cost budget for you in\nhose terms* knowing from you first the number of programs and other inf¬\normation <,\nSincerely yours*\n/s/ Duncan Emrich\nDuncan Emrich\nChief* Folklore Section\nMr® Harry Jo Skornia\nUi Gregory Hall\nUrbana* Illinois\nCopied at NAEB Hqs® on October 13* 19!&«cp"
