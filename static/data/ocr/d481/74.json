We're\nreally pleased at the cooperation and willingness to change\ndirections on this that everyone has shown. It’s good to\nsee this off the shelf.\nNow to jump to something quite different. The National Head¬\nquarters of the American Association of Agricultural College\nEditors is now located here in Wells Hall. We're trying to\nsupport this new venture in all ways possible - one of these\nways is to call members’ attention to various communication\nitems of potential use to them. One that we think they\nshould know about is the recording \"A Word in Your Ear\" from\nthe NAEB sponsored album Ways of Mankind. We'd like to make\nseveral tape copies of this recording and offer them for loan\nto members of AAACE, along with information on where they can\nsecure the recording for their own use.\nIn your opinion, would this be acceptable to NAEB? Would it\nrun counter to NAEB’s arrangement with Indiana University\nAudio-Visual Center for distribution? Would Mr. Harley be\nthe one to write?\nWe’ll appreciate your advice.\nSincerely,\nDonald E. Wells\nDirector\n1961\nDEW/cp\nDr. Harry J. Skornia\nCollege of Journalism and Communications\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nMarch 16, 1961"
