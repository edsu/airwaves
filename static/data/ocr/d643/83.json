However, I point out that that is not unrelated\nto picture that Bronson always pushes. Professional\nAdvancement Committee gave some consideration to this,\nbut actual proposal was left to a Sub-Committee, and that\nSub-Committee hasn’t met, I believe, because of funds.\nAnother thing, these changes can’t be made in a hurry,\neven in the first draft, and the assembly is entitled to\na 30-day notice before Convention time. Maybe one approach\nwould be to use the convention as a site for proposed\nneeded changes, and leave actual changes to the following\nyear.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFES:nb"
