From the\nback of ihe WOI Program Schedule, this quote about the show;\n\"VARIATIONS in music, drama, books, features and news, designed for a\npleasant ^summer afternoon#• #no one watches the dock since each segment\nruns until it’s finished. No one works hard • • • everybody relaxes, # ,\nand we hope you will too I”\nThis idea is part of a plan, I think, to throw off seme of the restrictions\nof time and scheduling; to make radio a service for a variety of things# The\naforesaid Monitor is doing this on NBC; perhaps with only fair success so far,\nbut it seems a step in the right direction. On this kind of show, be it afternoon\nor evening, you can put a lot of short features on that you might not have found\na place for in the usual tight schedule —- three minute book reviews, five minute\ninterviews with faculty engaged in research, a few minutes from a psychology lab\nfor an animal experinnodi, a three minute list of good books by the librarian, etc.\nAnyway, the idea seems worth repeating to you# Let us have your thoughts on\nshows so this page can contain some hot items# Surely there must be a wealth of\nideas in the NAEB member stations andre'd iil® to share them with the memberf&ip."
