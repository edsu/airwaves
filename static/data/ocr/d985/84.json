I think you do them very well\nindeed and it is certainly a comfort to he able to rely on an adequate\nsummary and review. Another thing I like about the service is the speed\nat which you move in getting material into circulation. Several other\npapers are on the way to you at present.\nBurton Paulu suggested that we might send you papers from time to time\nwith the idea of journal publication in mind - that is, either in addition\nto Pact Sheet publication or as an alternative to it. I wonder if you would\nhe kind enough to let me have a few details about the journal. I simply\nhave not been able to get hold of one - for the good reason, I suppose, that\nthe journal is very new. The things I am interested in are: the simplicity\nlaypl ?yh wlyi -ffio papers in are written, the required length of papers,\nthe period of delay between acceptance and publication, and anything special\nabout format.\n.That I have in mind as a submission to you is the paper on the effect\nof television upon the interests and the initiative of adult viewers - which\nyou summarised a little time ago. Does this paper seem a possibility to\nyou, or would a journal-length paper be too much like a repetition of the\nPacts Sheet information?\nWith kind regards,\nYours sincerely,\n(W. A.
