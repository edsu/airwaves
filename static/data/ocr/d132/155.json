Upon reviewing your tabular\nbreakdown, however, I discovered that there is apparently no provision for this\ncategory of expense* Does this mean that the so-called operating expenses are\nnot allowable? Does it mean that all operating expenses must be paid out of\nthe overhead account? I raise these questions because a determination of them\nwill affect the fiscal report# Incidentally, if you would like the above re¬\nport revised in any way, just let me know*"
