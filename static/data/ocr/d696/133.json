Hill\nAdministrative Vice President, NASB\n13U6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Harold:\nEnclosed you will find three ideas of our artist for the\nslides. You recognize, of course, that these are hurr¬\niedly done, and are susceptible to a lot of refinement.\nBut at least they indicate what could be done.\nRegarding the cost — I can get these slides made locally\nat the rate of $10.60 per dozen or $3 for £0, single\ncopy. Several copies would, of course, be multiples of\nthese rates. These prices are for good quality glass\nslides.\nElmetxG.
