I described these two hypo¬\nthetical SITUATIONS MERELY IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT\n'APPREHEND MORE CLEARLY JUST WHAT THE ACTUAL SITU¬\nATION is. There is a stream of criticism from mem¬\nbers OF THE LARGER WHITE SOCIETY. THIS IS BOUND T\nINFLUENCE THE NEGRO AND TO MAKE THE CONTENT OF HIS\nSELF-IMAGE UNFLATTERING TO HIMSELF.

The\nNegro learns that he is d i rty ...considered dirty,\nINADEQUATE, LOW, ANIMAL-LIKE...GENERALLY INFERIOR.\nBut the criticism is more than verbal.
