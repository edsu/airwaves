If he’s\ntied up then, I’ll try to make it March 2.\nI’m &oing to try to get together with Lillian\nBrown March 2....subject to this possible con¬\nflict ....since I never did, as I should have,\nt San Francisco.. ..and said I would.\nThis being the case, How about NAEB business\nand social contacts the night of March! 1*\nsince I’m scheduled to arrive on Capital 7fl4\nat 5:13 Ptyl/ I also wotild be glad to spend\nSaturday morning on any NAEB business you\nwant...* Am sending a couple of copies of\nthis, in case you’d like to inform Vern or\nothers...As you can see, it would be just as\nwell not to expect me to try to do separate\nletters to all..*\nDo I understand you’ll be out of town your\nself? I don’t seem to have a firm reply to\nthat, though Harold had that impression.,\nThought I’d better get this set. up. I am\nseeduled to leave Sat. at 2:10 so I 1 be\nback home by midnight. On Monday, as you\nmay recall, I’ll be doing the Assn for\nHigher Edu.. stint^ asked for by Kerry Smith.\nHence I think I should not delay return home\nuntil Sunday, as I had earlier planned..\nRegards\nHarry Sk"
