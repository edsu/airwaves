  "text": "DATE: February 25, 1957\nTO: Bob Underwood, Waldo Abbot\nEdward J. Slack, John Regnell\nFROM: Hugh M. Mix\n50 YEARS OF PROGRESS: No. Program is disconnected, redundant and tries to\ncover far too much material. It is 30 minutes of wasted time as far as I am\nconcerned.\nSUCCESS IN THE ARTS: No. The subject matter here seems far more suited to\na fifteen minute program than 30 minutes, although the program is pretty well\ndone. I don’t think people are that interested in choreography. I suggest\nthe series be edited and re-submitted as a series of 15 minute programs.\nINDIAN COUNTRY: Yes.\nMINDS OF MEN: Yes.\nJAZZ U.S.A.: I agree with Slack that the commentators are talking a little\nover the heads of most people, but I feel they will go along with the program\nif the music is good. Yes.\nAFRICA TODAY: Yes.\nFAMILY LIFE FORUM: Yes.\nSEARCH FOR HEALTH: Yes.\nCIVIL RIGHTS: Yes. I presume the timely introduction and close will be edited\nout or substituted for.\nATOMS FOR POWER: Yes.\nSECUIRTY AND CIVIL RIGHTS: Yes. This program duplicates in a material way the\nCIVIL RIGHTS program voted on above. They should be offered to stations at dif¬\nferent periods.\nHMM/bh\n< ElL* El IV ELO\nNAE8 HEADQUARTERS\nr ub 2 7 ibo7\n* *» P M\n7|8,»|iptli|12i lt8i3t4|5|6\ni"
