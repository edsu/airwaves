I assume that if any rate making occurs it will be\napplicable to both media but have no assurances.\nAs I understand it, AT&T is foot dragging, though I do\nnot have a clear picture as yet. Indications are that\nthe commission will ask for comments at some future time.\nIf this develops, we will advise NER affiliates and we111\nget off a note to you.\nSumming up: Information regarding radio is not generally\navailable. It is assumed that TV and radio are tied together.\nThe matter is currently under study.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:lkl"
