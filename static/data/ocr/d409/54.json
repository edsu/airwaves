It is essential, therefore, that classrooms be carefully designed to\nprovide for the full utilization of modern teaching tools.\nIn planning classrooms, the following factors should be considered:\n1. Light control to permit satisfactory projection of all kinds of\nmedia under all classroom conditions\n2. Electrical installations, such as electrical switches and out¬\nlets, speaker conduits, and light dimmers\n3. Ventilation and temperature control\n!i* Projection screens and stands\nRadio and television antenna installations\n6. Acoustical treatment\n7. Vertical and horizontal display facilities\n8. Storage facilities\nThese and other aspects of classroom planning are discussed in detail in the\nfirst brochure in this series (_)•\nGeneral Housing Plans\nIt would be inadvisable, and in fact impossible, to make one master\nblueprint of a center to fit the demands of each college or university. The\nfacilities of such a center should be tailored to the needs and educational\nobjectives of the institution it is to serve. There are, however, some gen¬\neralizations which should be considered in the planning and constructing of\na college audio-visual service center."
