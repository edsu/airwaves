PUBLIC SERVICE RADIO\nCONSULTANT, NEW YORK, NEW YORK\nMr. Chairman and Commissioners, my name is Morris S. Novik and my address\nis 630 Fifth Avenue, New York City. I am a Public Service Radio Consultant.\nAlthough in my professional capacity I represent some labor organizations, some\ncommercially operated radio stations, am Executive Secretary of the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters, and am also the President of a corpoÂ¬\nrate applicant for a standard broadcasting station, I want to make it clear at\nthe outset that I am not testifying on behalf of any of these groups. I appear\nand testify as an individual and the views which I express are my own.\nSince 1932, when I first became associated with radio broadcasting, I\nhave been directly concerned with the subject matter of this hearing. From\n1938 to 1946 I was the Director of the Municipal Broadcasting System of the\nCity of New York, the licensee of WNYC and WNYC-FM.\nPerhaps the best way for me to summarize the position which I take in\nthis hearing is to state at the outset that I think this very hearing, the wide\nvariety of opinions expressed here and the free discussion of the problems\nillustrate the basic solutions of the issues raised by the Mayflower decision."
