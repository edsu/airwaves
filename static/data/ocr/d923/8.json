A full-time editor would also\nmake possible idle exploration of advertising in the Journal as a source of\nadditional support, and many other possibilities not now possible in the present\nhand-to-mouth ^holding** operatic*,: being conducted.\nProbably no other single product of the NAEB shows as much promise of\nrelatively short-term success in dramatising to educational broadcasters and\nadministrators alike the values of membership, and the new contributions to\nAmerican education which these electronic media, responsibly used, can make.\nThis will broaden the base of support of the NAEB at both the individual and the\ninstitutional levels. To make our publications ^must*1 reading to the people who\nneed such guidance as we can provide, and to achieve the distinction in format\nand editing which the content available is already beginning to achieve, the\ndrastic Improvement which our request envisions appears essential. It also\nappears to offer the likelihood of more rapid fiscal returns than any of the other\nprojects proposed."
