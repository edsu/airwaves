Advertising in Action — Community Mobilization\nHigh on my desk is a pile of letters and memos from you, telling\nof some of the work you have been doing. This is fascinating reading,\nand reflects the devotion, time and talent you have given this program.\nI'd like to reproduce it all for you, but it would be a volume.\nBut I thought you'd be interested in some of the highlights $ these\nare just some of the activities in some of the cities. During these past\nmonths, you all have supported the first priority — jobs for youth —\nand the employment opportunities developed are due in important measure\nto your cooperation with the NAB program.\nWe are recording everything we hear about, and look forward to having\na complete, city-by-city report for the Vice President and the AAAA.\nI was most impressed by the material and information so many of you\nsent in response to my last memorandum-the one telling of the\nforthcoming Advertising Council press conference."
