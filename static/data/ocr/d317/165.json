Skomia\nHave discussed with President Schooley how most equitably to help\nsupport regional meetings requested. The decision we’ve come up\nwith is to tell each of you three that you can each count on not over\n$400.00 for a regional meeting before June 3 0.\nIf and when you get dates set and plan to send out announcements\nplease correspond with Harold Hill on the way in which reimburse¬\nments and/or expenses (for which we are to pay) will need to be\nhandled. Since all travel (if any) which is reimbursed has to be tax\nexempt, since this all goes through on University of Illinois vouchers,\netc, We want to be sure none of you gets stuck or frustrated later on.\nHJS:jg\nCC: F.
