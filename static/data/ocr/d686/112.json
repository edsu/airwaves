These have been distributed to the\nentire Board, plus Smythe, Probst, McCarty and Horton.\nThis should make it official — if it isnft already]\nGriffith has already sent $1000 to Horton, plus\n$2800 (the two-thirds suggested) to Hart and N0RC.\nHe asks that you, as acting president, send him written\nauthorization for these two advances. I think he would\nlike to receive this quite soon.\nHolding meetings by telephone and telegraph is a\nbit hectic — and may result in some of the same things\nbeing done by two or more of us. But it did get done,\nand I should say with a minimum of delay.\nGood luck to you with that thesis outline J\nBurton Paulu\nSecretary and\nPublications Editor\nBP:bz\nYours sincere\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W.
