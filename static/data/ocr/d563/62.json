He is recalling his\ndays as a teacher in Atlanta. “Many kids just\nwait for any opportunity to alter the mood of a\nserious lesson. I had to be careful about bringing\ndemonstration objects into the classroom.

By classtime, everything is set up.\nI use the car as effortlessly as I would a test tube. ”\nJim Barfield, a colleague of Guptill who teaches\nhealth on television, almost seems to be present\nin the twenty-two classrooms his course reaches.\nIn a lesson on the blood and circulatory system\none day, Barfield pricked his finger under the\ncloseup lens of the camera.
