I thought the fol¬\nlowing idea might be worth something to some of us.\n\"Radio stations (KANU is no exception) are often staffed \"with creative,\nsometimes temperamental, hard-working individuals. During a normal day, they\nmay be announcers, librarians, engineers, secretaries, traffic managers, etc.\nYet they seem to have one common characteristic—IDEAS, IDEAS, and more IDEAS.\nWe call it Ideaitis.\n\"Why not try this?\" \"Maybe a network could be interested in this.\" \"This\nwill make history.\" So it goes, day in and day out. Ideas radiate from the\noffice like energy from an atomic explosion. KANU, in the hope of salving\nthe ignored genius of its staff, presents STAFF WORKSHOP, 2:30 P.M., Saturdays.\nThe program will be dedicated to the staff ideas.\"\nSo KANU puts on this hour long show each week, including a wide range of\nideas from early English drama, to discussions of art, politics, and philoso¬\nphy, to barbershop harmony, comedy, human interest features, and special shots\nlike the remote from Osawatomie State Hospital. Naturally the show gives the\nstaff a chance to write, produce, direct, and perform in a free, unrestrained\natmosphere. Seems to me this idea could be used by a good many stations to en¬\ncourage staff or student talent.\n—Ken Wright, MOT"
