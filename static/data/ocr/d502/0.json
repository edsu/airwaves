'We can reach modest agreement\nwith Novik if we get no funds, be more generous if we do get\nfunds* But time is of the essence, and I should like to\nkeep NAEB claim to all such areas as positive and clear cut\nas possible*\nI suggest advisory committee take this up, as well\nas NAEB Board, or many of our services are likely to be adopted.\nI can see Center Interests in individual cases, but hope the\nstation union relations problem as such is seen as unequivocably\nours.\nFor Board Discussion in January*\n12-10-53"
