The establishing of these contacts is not\nregarded by Radio Nederland as constituting its main task, for\nthat, once again, consists of fostering goodwill for the Netherlands\nin the widest sense.\nTranscription programmes are yet another of Radio Nederland’s\nmeans of achieving its purpose. These programmes are recorded\nin Hilversum on disc or tape and supplied free of charge to\nforeign radio stations for local broadcasting. This has obvious\nadvantages, but their real merit lies in the fact that they can be\nproduced in many more languages than the six which may be\nheard daily in the direct transmissions.\nGenerally speaking the transcription programmes are of a cultural\nnature, containing, as far as possible, a Dutch aspect. It is no\nexaggeration to say that the international reputation of the Amster¬\ndam Concertgebouw Orchestra has been greatly furthered by the\ntranscription programmes of Radio Nederland.
