On it I had two Japanese\nscholars who speak excellent English. I interviewed one on\nthe subject of the noren- the dramatic and colorful shop signs\nhanging before stores, rejftaurants, etc. The other interview\nwas on bonkei miniature landscaping in trays and boxes for home\ndisplay. This in addition to the newsreel which treated tilted\nlively items, and a profile on the Emperor.\nI am outlining a fourth program and will have it written\nby the end of this week, and record it before the first of May.\nThere is something which I want to bring up and want your advice\nabout: the costs of production and mailing.\nEach script costs $2.50 to be typed ( 4 copies).\nI pay the engineer who comes in Saturday $5*00\nI had to borrow a Far Eastern Ntwork announcer last week and pay\nhim $5.00 n\nI usually lunch or treat my guests, for it is customary here to\ngive a talent fee; but since I don't do that I invite them to,\nlunch at International House or the Union Club. S&Y\nI am glad to do this, throwing in my own time and effort of course,\nfor I think the experience is valuable and m$iy pay off at a later\ndate, but since eac h scrijbib costs me $10 to produce, why couldn't\nNAEB give me $10. per program ( Mailing, by the way is 80 cents).\nThis would seem to be reasonable, and I thought that after you\nhave heard the fourth program and would be in a better position"
