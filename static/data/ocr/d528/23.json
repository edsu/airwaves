Witherspoon\nKEBS\nSan Diego State College\nSan Diego, California 92115\nDear John:\nRobert Woods advises me that he will write you re the\nproposed rule making limiting radio-tv combinations. Woods\ntells me that it doesn’t apply to non-commercial educational\nand that you have no problems. However, he assured me he\nwould tell you all this and more directly by mail.\nAl Hulsen and I had a long but fruitful meeting\nyesterday afternoon, and X agreed to participate in the\nbriefing on September 16 as you requested.\nMy remarks will be limited to the topics you suggest\nthough just how I’m to cover all that in ten minutes puzzles\nme somewhatl 1’11 be ready on the 16th.\nIf we need to check signals before we go on, breakfast\nprior to the presentation would be a possibility. I always\nlike to talk these matters over so that the panel doesn’t\nsurprise each other when the show begins 1\nThe NERN aituation is finally beginning to shake down.\nWe have overcome the technical problems - all duplicators\nare working - the mastering units are in shape - order is\nbeing brought out of chaos.\nHave you seen the October-November-December program\noffering? It isn’t all we wanted it to be but believe there\nIs considerable improvement, and we know the January-February-\nMarch stohedule will be even better.\nI’ll look forward to joining you and Al for the September 16\nsession*,-\nSincerely,\nRAM:kh\ncc: Hulsen\nRobert A. Mott"
