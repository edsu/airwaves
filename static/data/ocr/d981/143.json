Schooley\nFrom* Burton Faulu\nI have been looking over the note that Harry Skomla\nsent on April 8 about possible alternate procedures In regard\nto the Ford Foundation due to the unfortunate death of John\nWeiss.\nI agree that we should be prepared to offer an Interim\nproposal In the event that John*s death causes major dislocation\nIn the Foundations grants in television. But I also go along\nwith Frank1s suggestion that we \"Just sit and wait for a while,\ntill we*re told what to do.\"\nIt seems to me that sometime soon you should call one of\nyour contacts in the Ford Foundation, and feel around a little\nbit to see what*s going to happen. John had been circulating\nthis among his associates according to his note to you of\nApril 3. Due to the size of the request, it is certain that\ntop-level approval would in any case be necessary before it was\naccepted or rejected! and It may be that such reactions were\nalready being formulated, and soon will be forwarded to us.\nThis you could determine from your telephone conversation. On\nthe other hand, if they are completely stopped with this\nproject, and ask for several months more to consider it, you\ncan say that we are prepared to submit an interim proposal\n\"to help them out of their difficulty.\"\nFrank also suggests asking for a straight renewal rather\nthan any other interim suggestion. This too impresses me as\na good Idea, but you will have to play it by ear and do what\nseems best.\nIn the long run, of course, we want foundation grants that\nare large, cover the right areas, and are long range. If John*s\ndeath makes this impossible at the moment, then by all means\nlet us suggest an interim procedure; but not to the exclusion\nof the long view.\nBP*ds"
