C. 20036\nDear Mr. Harley:\nEnclosed are copies of my letters to Senators Alan Bible, Howard Cannon and\nCongressman Walter Baring in which you will note I have taken your name in vain!\nI was somewhat shocked but pleased to find that Senator Cannon was on the Commerce\nCommittee and had lunched with Dr. Killian the day before. He seemed very inÂ¬\nterested, but spent a good deal of the time questioning me about the Nevada picture.\nHe seems very anxious for more information so I therefore leave him in the capable\nhands of the NAEB.\nSenator Bible's comment was that he has been for ETV since he saw it on a trip to\nAmerican Samoa. There's not too much to say after that, is there?\nWhen the bill gets close to going to the House, I think you will find a receptive\naudience in the person of Congressman Baring. His office, too, seemed vitally\ninterested in the Nevada ETV project and what it might do for the state.\nThe conference was excellent and I was pleased to have the opportunity to attend.\nSincerely,\nHELEN A, SIDLER (Miss), Coordinator\nResearch and Development\nHAS:eli\nCLARK CO\nSCHOOL DISTRICT\nTELEPHONE 736-501 1 -2832 EAST FLAMINGO ROAD - LAS VEGAS, NE\nD A"
