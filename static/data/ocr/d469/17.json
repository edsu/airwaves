  "text": "3\na) A \"working paper\" which is a comparison of the main features of\nthe Public Broadcasting Act (Title I) with the ETV Facilities Act.\nb) An excerpt from the House Report on the Public Broadcasting Act on\nthe subject of 757* grants. We include this for your information\nto illustrate a problem in policy about the handling of \"matching\nfunds\" under the program. It is an important item of legislative\nhistory and therefore will be a policy factor. I'm not sure everyÂ¬\nbody understands what is meant by the Committee's intent that\n\"the 757* grant should be the exception rather than the rule,\" Policy\non this point has not yet been finally approved - but if you want to\ndiscuss it later,- we'll be glad to speculate along with you.\nc) A third enclosure in your package is a \"reconciled\" version of Title I\nof the Public Broadcasting Act. As printed in the Act itself,\nTitle I contains only additions and deletions relevant to amending\nthe ETV Facilities Act. This enclosure is a version whi,ch;\nincorporates the amendments, so that it can be read in complete\ncontext. (IT IS, of course, only Title I - the other. Titles\nwhich relate to the Public Broadcasting Corporation and a study of\ninstructional technology are not our concern today.)\nd) A fourth enclosure is a copy of our first Program Bulletin, covering\nnine categories of information about the Facilities Program. Many\nof you, I'm sure, have already received this Bulletin through the\nmail. We have included copies in your package of materials, largely\nbecause the Bulletin summarizes most of what can be said about\nprogram administration up to the present time."
