  "text": "trast between bis prevailing mood and the dominant one in our own time.\nMost important of all in this program is the meaning of the freedom that\nJefferson was*fighting for. This freedom had many varieties and he was for all\nof them. His struggle for religious freedom, which is dealt with more fully in\nanother program, is anticipated here; and diversity rather than uniformity is set\nup as a goal - in direct opposition to that of any monolithic state. Also, in\nthis program there is the thought that the Declaration embodies ideals which were\nnot then attained or attainable, and some of which have not yet been achieved. The\ntime was not yet ripe - so people thought - to abolish the slave trade, though it\nwas eventually abolished. The ideal of full equality of rights among all men,\nregardless of birth or wealth or station, is one toward which mankind is still\nmarching. The supremely important thing is that the goal, at least, was recog¬\nnized at the very beginning. The main theme of American history runs through the\nDeclaration: the equal right of all men to freedom and opportunity. All the later\nprograms may be regarded as elaborations on that.\nQuestions and Topics for Discussion\n1. If, as Jefferson said, \"the earth belongs always to the living generation,\"\nwhat can we hope to learn from the Declaration of Independence, written in\n1776?\n2. What are the chief differences, if any, between the \"tyrants\" of Jefferson's\nday and those of our own?\n3. In 1776 was Jefferson emphasizing freedom more than security, or security\nmore than freedom?\n4. How would you compare his mood and that of the other Signers with the predomi¬\nnant mood in our country today? In other countries? What _is the predominant\nmood today?\n5. If you see an important difference, what is your explanation of it?\n6. What do you think Jefferson and his contemporaries understood by the state¬\nment, \"all men are created equal\"?\n18"
