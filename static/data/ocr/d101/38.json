If you don't have details on the\nmeeting, let me explain briefly that it will be the purpose\nof the meeting to produce a document for the US Office of\nEducation in what they called 'sharing of resources and\nfacilities' in educational broadcasting. They need this\nInformation to relate to Magnuson proposals coming to them\nor through them. My responsibility is to give a report on\nradio networking, excepting Wisconsin and NAEB,projects.\nSince I usually 'work through channels ' I thought perhaps\nyou could direct me to already existing information*or to\nsome persons who would be able to give me some briefs as to\ntheir involvement in this process. Personally, ilmalready\nsomewhat familiar with what is going on in many areas of\nthe country, but there must me a great deal about which I\nknow nothing.\nI said I write for 'hurried help' in that I must have some\ndata by the end of the first week in May, so that I might\ncompile a report. Perhaps you or your committee could come\nto my assistance, or at least give me some advice as to\nsources of Information which I might contact on my own.\nI anxiously await your response.\nC<vrrH a! 1 v\nl&rFyfFrymlre, Chairman, NAEB Radio Planning Committee.\nManager\nApril 7,1959"
