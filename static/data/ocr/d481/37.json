However, we will keep you advised on any\ngood looking openings that may appear so that, in case things donâ€™t\nwork out as you hope at Winthrop, you can avail yourself of other\nopportunities.\nUnfortunately, the NAEB By-Laws require that a member of the Board\nof Directors be on the staff of an institution which is an Active Mem-\nber of the NAEB. Accordingly, it would appear that you are no longer\neligible to continue as a Director for Region II by reason of your shift\nin job. We will probably have the Board appoint a replacement from\nthe region when it convenes in Madisfe*; in the meantime, you will\nserve as the Director, and are certainly welcome and wanted for the\nSeminar in Madison.\nI will look forward to seeing you there beside the shiny shores of\nLake Mendota.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident\nWGH:rkf"
