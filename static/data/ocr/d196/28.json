Thus the end of the political\nhoneymoon does not necessarily mean the end of Pella| not by any means*\nActually, Pella’s fate probably will depend almost entirely on\nwhat happens with regard to the explosive situation in Trieste. I\nhope to examine this question in a subsequent Letter from Italy.\nThis is Graham Hovey reporting. This program was recorded in the\nHome studios of Kadio Italians for the national Association of Mucation&l\nBroadcasters •• and this is the 1IAEB Tape network."
