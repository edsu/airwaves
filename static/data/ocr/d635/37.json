The basic purpose should be to bring\nthe entire Board up-to-date on the actions of the Executive\nCommittee, the Adult Education Committee, the Program Acceptance\nCommittee and the In-School Program Committee. Perhaps after\nthe Oklahoma meeting I will have more detailed ideas for an\nagenda.\nI don't believe that the Columbus meeting will be\nas rough a session as you indicate. I think it is more\nimportant for you to consider the luncheon which will really\nbe the major contribution of the organization to the Institute.\nsns/t\nend.\nRepresenting noncommercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
