The central portion of the movement contains a series\nof solo passages for each instrument. Two contrasting sections are\nheard in the second, movement. The first is a lyrical, expressive theme\nbegun in the strings and continued by the oboe. The second is an\nostinato figure, pizzicato, which builds to a climax. Both sections\nare repeated in varied form. The final movement is a Rondo punctuated\nby a short, recurring group of motives played in an always varying order."
