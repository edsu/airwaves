We are\nturning both the Paulu household and the KUOM office upside\ndown. Of all things I would not want to lose, a telegram\naddressed to me from the President of the United States\n(despite its obviously impersonal nature) would be number\none. Yet, it seems to have disappeared. Maybe a souvenir\nhunter in St. Louis pinched it! Well, anyway, if it's here,\nit will soon be found, and airmailed to you.\nSorry for causing the delay.\nBP:ds"
