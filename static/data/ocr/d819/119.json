Just this morning I had a\nlong telephone conversation with the mayor, superintendent of schools,\nand manager of the local radio station in one of the towns where we\npropose putting a satellite station, and they are really all for it.\nSo far so good! The bill goes to the legislature in a few days, but we\nmay have some hard going.\nLet me say that I think you handled the difficult role of NAEB\npresident very well at our New fork meeting. There are always cross\ncurrents and much jockeying for position, and I thought you acquitted\nyourself nobly. Congratulations!\nWith best personal regards,\nlours sincerely,\nLnc.\nBPscjm\nBurton Paulu\nManager"
