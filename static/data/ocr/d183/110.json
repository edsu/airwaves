  "text": "-5-\neducational radio people, all from the same geographical area, can validly\ndiscuss and recommend a nationally valid program,\" I have proposed this\nbecause of the obvious financial savings â€” it will let our money cover\nmore than twice as much ground, and do it just as well, I sincerely believe\nthis so I make the following:\nPROPOSAL:- THE NAEB BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE PLANNING GROUP\nREGIONALLY CENTER THE WORKING GROUPS WHENEVER THAT IS POSSIBLE.\nIf the Board rejects the planning group idea, then it is encumbent upon the\nBoard or at least the Executive Committee to meet at once with the Executive\nDirector to go over in detail the areas to be covered and how they shall be\ncovered.\nREPORTS\nThe question of reports has often been raised. I feel that Headquarters and\nNetwork should report often enough to keep the Board informed but not too\noften to become a burden either on the writer or the readers. Therefore,\nI make the following:\nPROPOSAL:- THE NAEB HEADQUARTERS AND TAPE NETWORK SHALL MAKE A DETAILED ANNUAL\nREPORT WHICH WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE BOARD, MEMBERS, AND FOUNDATION. THEY\nSHALL ALSO PREPARE QUARTERLY, NARRATIVE AND FINANCIAL REPORTS FOR SUBMISSION TO\nTHE BOARD."
