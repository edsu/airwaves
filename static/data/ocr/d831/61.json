Keith Tyler, Director\nNovember 27> 19^7\nDear Ray:\nAs we plan the opening of the Seminar on December 9, at the Ohio Union\noh the Ohio State University Canpns, we see three short introductory\npresentations. The two host organizations, the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters and The Ohio State Ifoiversity, will each be\nrepresented and say a few words of welcome. On behalf of the NAEB, I\nhave asked Burton Paulu to appear. On behalf of The Ohio State Univer¬\nsity, Mr. Frederic Heimberger, Vice President in charge of Instruction,\nwill do the job.\nFollowing this, we wotad like to have you, as Chairman of the Research\nCommittee, make a brief statosient about the purpose of the Seminar, why\nthe NAEB was interested, and how the thing developed. We have titled\nthis, \"The Task Before Us,\" on the assumption that you will not only give\nbackground but will present the challenge to the participants that the\nSeminar represents. Your presentation should probably be around ten\nminutes — perhaps a bit longer.\nFollowing this we will introduce all the participants and staff, clarify\nthe Seminar arrangements, and engage in groip planning for the week.\nLet me know whether you will be able to do this. I assume you will but\nI always like things to be confirmed. I am enclosing a prospectus of\nthe Seminar. We are adding to this the names of staff and, if we can\nget the information in time, the participants, and sending this out to\neveryone concerned.\nI await word ffom you.\nR4 tr\nI. Keith Tyler\nSeminar Director\nMr. Raymond Cheydleur\nChairman, NAEB Research Committee\nUniversity Broadcasting Service\nThe Florida State University\nTallahassee, Florida"
