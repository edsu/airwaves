Underwood, Jr.\nNetwork Manager\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr* Underwood:\nThank you for your prompt consideration of the Fairleigh Dickinson\nradio series, SCIENCE AND SOCIETY.\nEnclosed are the following:\n4 Network Program Submission Forms...An In-School Form must\nhave inadvertently slipped in. Hope the four forms wdill suffice.\n2 Tape Recordings of the SCIENCE AND SOCIETY series.\nh copies of promotional material.\nI have a few questions in regard to the grants-in-aid.\nSince the June 15 deadline has passed for the 1957 grants, what\nis the date for the I958 grants? Or could this SCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nseries still possibly be considered in light of the fact that it is\ncompleted within the 90 day starting date set for the I957 grants?\nIf the committee decides to use SCIENCE AND SOCIETY on the NAEB\nNetwork, is there any compensation to the University for its use?\nCan it be considered as a commissioned program?\nPlease forgive if some of these questions are very basic, but we\nhave no radio station or have never had any business with the NAEB\nbefore, so are in the dark about its operations. Would also like to\nreceive that sheet of detailed suggestions in preparation of applicatÂ¬\nions for grants-in-aid mentioned in the brochure.\nOnce again, many thanks for your kind consideration, and I hope\nthat SCIENCE AND SOCIETY might be favorably received.\nSincerely."
