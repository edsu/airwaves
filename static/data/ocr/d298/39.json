I hope you get the kind of cooperation you\nshould have from the members - in the way of news items.\nJust to keep things rolling I’m enclosing stories\nyou may want to use next time.\nEnclosed is a copy of our 19^8 radio report to the\nfaculty. You may want to lift from it such portions as make\nNews-Letter fodder. It is rather a good summary.\nAfter reading that Mac and I are doing something about\nthe Mayflower case\"statement I tried to recall some background\non the assignment. Mac couldn't either. What are we supposed\nto do, and when? We really haven't followed it very closely\nand it will mean research into background sources before we\ncan even talk intelligently about it. We know, of course, the\npress reports on it - but don't trust certain areas of the trade\npressl\nYour new NAEB application form really gets down to\ndetails. Do you plan another form for associate members, or\nindividuals? Send me a few application blanks. Perhaps I\ncan muster up some Teachers College interest.\nHAE:jh\nend. 2"
