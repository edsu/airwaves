A February 1st deadline\nhas been set for my rendering this report. A signed marginal\nnote on any of these enclosed pages would do.\nWarm regards. /'A— ^\nH. M. McLuhan/RN\nEnclosure s 4\nThe above letter and the enclosed sheets I have sent to the\nmembers of the Research Committee. I have carte blanche for\nGrade XI in Detroit, and doubt whether there would be any dif¬\nficulty in a four-meeting run in any city. Tell me what you\nthink about further processing this material before showing it\nto Warren Seibert, or before talking to him.\nH.M.M."
