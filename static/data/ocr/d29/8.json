Forsdale has a student\nwho has just completed a Ph.D. on the teaching of\nnew media to Grade XI students as part of their\nEnglish studies.\nThis man has taught these media in Grade XI\nIn Schenectady for the past two years.

Watch_\nand ward directed toward the program content”of\nthe' media was, and is, his purpose. A more mislead¬\ning or inhibiting approach to media is not possible.\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong with en¬\ncouraging the young to ask who controls the program\npolicies of the entertainment industries.
