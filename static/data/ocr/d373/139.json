We must not make those decisions which\nresult in the poor and disadvantaged getting\n\"stuck\" with a block of materials someone\n\"thought\" would be helpful for them to be\nexposed to.\nWe must work to convince the poor that it is\nworthwhile to invest a portion of their energy,\nthe energy they expend in the daily struggle for\nsurvival, in the reconstruction of their values,\nso that their lives can have greater meaning,\ntheir efforts have deeper validity. No single\nproject or proposal has, as yet, touched these\nvalues. So we may begin our task now, and say\nthat as of this date, we shall attack, confident,\nas we are confident, that there is a way, a reason\nto have hope that these things will come to pass."
