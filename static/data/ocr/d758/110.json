I feel sure that some of the top figures in the programmed learning\nfield would be only too glad to provide articles (Professor B# F# Skinner of\nHarvard, for example)#\n7# I agree on Stereo-FM#\n8# I agree on the \"case-by-case\" reports.\n9* I have no suggestions with respect to facets of the field not fully\ntreated in the past#\n10# I have often wondered how books to be reviewed and individuals to do\nthe reviews were chosen# Let’s establish a set procedure!\n11# If NAEB expects to serve the needs of its members and realize maximum\nreturns from the advertisers, it should make continuing studies, as do many\nother educational publications#\nFinally, with respect to the publication Educational Radio-TV# I was greatly\nsurprised when it came to my desk. Nothing was said in the masthead about whether\nit was a one-time publication or the beginning of a new one. If the latter, there\nwas nothing about its frequency. It was not designated as Volume 1, Number 1 or\nanything else# It did not have on the masthead anything about being entered as\nsecond class mail or that an application had been filed for such a privilege#\nThe only information about it was on the back cover, stating that it was a new\npublication and that this was a \"pilot issue,\" I wonder if it is intended that\nit take the place of NAEB Journal# At any rate I am confused#\nThanks again for the frankness of your agenda# If the Publications Committee\nis to truly serve its function, there must be the utmost frankness and let the\nchips fall where they may and with no exceptions#\nProfessor and Coordinator, and\nAssistant to the Vice President,\nAcademic Administration"
