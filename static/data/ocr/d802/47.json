This thing, as I have point¬\ned out before, has just ’’growed”, No one is to blame except the organisation it¬\nself. However, each year sees the network assessment growing; each year we lose a\nfew members and many more are desperately counting their pennies to see haw long\nthev can stay in*\nThe Network, so far as programming is concerned, has gone off on some pretty wild\ntangents at times. In most instances it has lost its original purposes of being\nan EXCHANGE CENTER between member stations of NAEB for programs.\nThe so-called Network Acceptance Committee has acted in a high-handed, arbitrary\nfashion — discouraging network participation and contribution. There has not been\none constructive idea to come from this group* For a tin® I thot the In-School\ngroup was somewhat better, but it is apparaent now that they,too, are mired down*\nBoth of these groups yell aoout submitting programs for their so-called considera¬\ntion* Yet when you do send in programs*..you never hear anything about than ( even\nthough you may have dozens and dozens of tapes tied up)*\nTherefore, I see no use in compounding a felony by taking the Chairman of these\ngroups and creating a so-called ’’coordinating committee”* True there may be some\nbeautiful speeches and brilliant recommendations that will stuff up the chimneys*\nGet some new blood into this thing, forget souse of the old nesters and moss-backs,\ntreats a committee that will have power tc get in there and do something, that will\nplan ahead program-wise, that will enccurftS@ member-wide participation — s committee\nthat can pull these other committees up by the scruff of the neck and make 'em\nfunction as they should. I'll vote for that kind of a committee; the other kind is\na mere waste of pencil and paper to put ’wi down.\nAnd while we're on the subject of committees*.some very definite directives were\nhanded down at the last convention. Nearly eight months have passed and to my\nknowledge NOTHING has been done about them. It was not the intention of the conven¬\ntion that we should wait until we assemble in New York to act."
