The development of more new professions and semi-professions with supporting\nprograms of education leading to new degrees.\n2. Continued emphasis on technological education.\n3. Increase in graduate education for teacher education* the further development\nof advanced professional education* and probably some further development of existing\ngraduate education.\n4. Increased emphasis on talent searching* guidance* and placement for the better\nuse of both human and educational resources.\n5. Continued shrinkage* percentage wise* of the liberal arts groups within\nhigher education* counterbalanced* from the liberal arts viewpoint* by continued increase\nin the liberal arts content of professional education.\nHaving in this paper already ventured far beyond the safe limits of hypothesis and\n^peculation* it is obviously now too late for me to use the classical closing phrase of\n\"beyond this I dare not go\". The only precaution I can take is to remind you* in case\nyou need reminding* that these are only one man's guesses. I cannot vouch for their accuracy.\nBut I can note that* in the light of present knowledge we do not seem to have done much more\nthan to cross the frontiers of opportunity in the development and professional application\nof the social sciences and the sciences. Hence it seems a reasonably safe observation that\nwe can expect to spend the rest of our own professional lives in helping to support explora¬\ntions that will ultimately go far beyond those frontiers."
