It was recognized that the\ndistribution of voting strength would be an important consideration.\nBecause (l) recruitment efforts might bring about new conditions and\nbecause (2) on-the-spot analysis of implications involved in the plans\nseemed difficult, no vote was taken regarding recommendations.\nJune 15, 9s00 A.M.\n\"Televised Education\"\nSpeaker\nMr. George Arms\nOperations Manager, KETC-TV, St. Louis\nThere are at least two points of view concerning almost every¬\nthing in ETV. There are concepts of the formal and the informal. Every¬\nthing has a beginning, middle and end in the formal. TV broadcasts of\nHouston School Board meetings are not organized but are still the highest\nkind of education. These are informal. Dramas are usually informal and\nnot organized from the viewpoint of education.\nProduction standpoints differ. Televised education puts cameras\non whatever is already there and organized. No \"production\" is added.\nPutting cameras on whatever goes on in the olassroom is the simplest\nkind of televised education. The watcher feels he is a student in the\nolassroom. There is a minimum amount of adaptation for TV. Some say\nthis is not good and that adaptation should be made.\nSucceeding with televised education is a fight. Sometimes\nthere is resistance; usually apathy. Figure an angle and offer a course"
