And a final potpourri of ideas . . .\nThings zve can’t classify anyplace else.\n• After a faculty member — or anyone else, for that matter—\nappears on your program, do you promptly send him a\n“thank you” note?\n• How about Christmas cards from your station to your\nfriends?\n• And a sympathetic letter or telephone call to a performer\nwho is ill?\n• When you can find the time, do you or other members of the\nstaff attend public service meetings of a nonbroadcasting\nnature ?\n• And, along the same lines, are you and others on the staff\nsufficiently identified with service and other civic groups?\nThis is your last challenge. If you rate Merit\nBadge Number 6 — as well as 1 through 5\n— you don’t need this publication anyway.\nThe Golden Rule is our best justification for perfect Public Relations."
