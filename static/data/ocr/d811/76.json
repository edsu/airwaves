Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Mr. Powelli\nEnclosed is the art work for the \"pictogram\" which we have Just received\nback from the artist. You*11 recall that last year we had the pictures of\nthe listening groups, without the radio tower. Following your suggestion,\nafter hearing that you were going to feature the NAEB this year, we sent\nthe original art work back to the artist and asked that a radio tower be\nadded. I believe the result is about what you had in mind.\nI trust that you have found the photos from St. Louis and Chicago which we\nsent last year and which our records indicate are still in your office. If\nnot, perhaps our records are in error and we have lost them. In that event,\nif you'll let me know, 1*11 try to secure some other pictures for the story.\nIf there is anything else you need, please let me know, and we certainly\nappreciate the fact that our story will appear in the Foundation report.\nIncidentally, I would like to have the enclosed art work back when you are\nfinally through with it, because I believe it might be used in promotional\nbrochures to good advantage.\nSincerely,\nHEHtJO\nEnclosure\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
