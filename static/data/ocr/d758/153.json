The effort was\nmade to analyze the types of articles appearing in the\nNAEB JOURNAL for a period of a year.\nNow that the judgments have been expressed,\nI*m not so sure how helpful the findings will be. There\nappears to be much disagreement even among committee\nmembers. However, there are certain types of articles in\nwhich there is general agreement. Perhaps, in considering\nany future changes in the JOURNAL some of the opinions\nwill be helpful.\nI have the individual polls should you care\nto have them.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nRetired Chairman\nNAEB Publications Committee\nFESfb\ncc: Harold Hill"
