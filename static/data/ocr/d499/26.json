The decision to make such a request follows\nmy conversation with Sir Charles Moses in Paris at the time\nof the EBU Conference on educational broadcasting.\nOne of the principal reasons for NAEB’s wishing to join ABU\nis the interest we share in assisting developing countries\nof Asia in the use of radio and television for fostering\neducational and national development, NAEB, as you know,\ndesigned the instructional system in American Samoa and\ncontinues to supervise the recruitment of personnel and\noperation of the technical facilities for this system, which\nmaximizes the use of television for instruction. In addition,\nNAEB is currently exploring ways of working with SEAMES to\ndetermine whether such a regional organization can serve as\nan instrument to assist in national planning for the use of\neducational broadcasting in Southeast Asia,\nWe are sincerely interested in working with ABU and its\nmembership in sharing with Asian nations the accumulatedn\nexperience we have gained in the appropriate use of radio\nand television to help meet vast and urgent educational and\nsocial demands; we believe participation in ABU*s councils and\nactivities will provide an effective means for American educa¬\ntional broadcasters to help advance such cooperative effort."
