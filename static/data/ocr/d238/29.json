SMYTHE\nIllinois University Communi¬\ncations Research Institute\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear NAEB Member:\nHere’s another questionnaire I\nYou probably dislike filling out these things just\nas much as I do. But, when Dick Hull asked me to gather\nsome budget data for the NAEB meeting next month, I was\nglad to take on the project—despite my feeling that too\nmany people send out too many questionnaires gathering\ntoo much data about too many unimportant subjects !\nBut this questionnaire has at least one distinctive\nfeature: it deals with a subject of interest and import¬\nance to every station manager—comparative budget data.\nThe attached questionnaire should be self-explanatory.\nI’ve tried to include most of the positions to be found\nat NAEB stations. Space has been left for you to add any\nI may have missed. If your staff setup combines some of\nthese positions, please show that in your reply. In other\nwords, don’t hesitate to add, subtract, or alter this form\nif thereby your answers are made more meaningful.\nNeedless to say all the data you send me will be\nheld in strict confidence. It will be processed for\ndistribution just to NAEB members. References to individ¬\nual stations will be by code letters only.\n■Kill you help me by filling out this questionnaire,\nand returning it to me as soon as possible?\nSee you at Ann Arbor!\nYours sincerely,\n[fS U'vtOL\nBurton Paulu\nManager of KUOM\nP.S. Please mail the questionnaire to me at Station KUOM,\nUniversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis lU, Minnesota.\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
