I stopped in Washington, New York, East Lansing, and\nAnn Arbor, and saw quite a number of people in each place.\nWhat went on at the JCET meeting on the l^th? I'd appreciate\na little report as to the points covered and action taken.\nI have before me a copy of Jack Dunn's letter of December 5\nto you, in which \"For reasons which are quite obvious\" (meaning\nthat he was not elected president?) he was declining the invitation\nto attend the AETA meeting in Chicago. In this letter he also says\nthat his station will not be a member of NAEB for 1957.\nHow should we proceed? I certainly hate seeing someone who has\nbeen in our fold for so long moving out like this. For his own\nhappiness as well as ours, I wish we could do something to have him\ncontinue with the Association in a more or less active way. Any\nsuggestions will certainly be appreciated.\nYours sincerely\nBurton Paulu\nDirector Region b\nBP: It"
