This group is increasing even faster than California's\npopulation as a State.\n(2) The State spends currently about $1 billion to educate these\nstudents. This represents 43C out of every tax dollar the\nState receives. A huge additional tax load is imposed by the\nvarious school districts. However, it is estimated that this\nfinancial burden will increase at least two or threefold during\nthe next 15 years.\n(3) This is expected to happen at the very same time when vast\ntechnological, social, and political changes all over the world\nmake it absolutely essential that we offer more and better\ninstruction in every major field of knowledge.\nB. The Question\nRecent experience and studies by many educational institutions\nindicate strongly that the effective use of television is \"a great\nforce for good in education.\"* Consequently, Governor Edmund G. Brown\nestablished in 1959 an Advisory Committee on Educational Television.\n*Roy E, Simpson, Supt. of Public Instruction, in a foreword to Bulletin\n#4, Vol. XXIX of the State Department of Education, dealing with Television\nfor California Schools and prepared by William H. Allen."
