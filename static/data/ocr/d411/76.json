For practitioners; To provide references to, and\ndigests of, research which they can apply in their\nprofessional work*\n2« For researchers? To conserve effort by identifying\nresearch related to studies researchers may be con¬\nsidering*\nFor both groups, of course, there is the implication that keeping\nup with relevant research is a professional obligation*\nThe end result will be a document that will includes\n1* A descriptive commentary on the research findings\nbased on the body of s tudies selected for review,\norganized to reflect the nature of the available\ndata*\n2o An attempt to point up highlights, to draw implica¬\ntions, and to suggest areas of needed research*\n3* An annotated bibliography of research, including\nall sources referred to plus marginal work related\nto the subject or problem*\nThere will be some standardization of each document in the series*\nAt the same time, there will be enough flexibility to permit the\ntreatment to reflect the essential nature of the area selected*"
