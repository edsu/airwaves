Use sound,\nmusic, characterizations, even unidentified voices coming in from\nnowhere.\n2) Sometimes use a narrator who is one of the characters in a dramatic\ninsert.\n3) Warning: Don*t write straight narration when a brief dramatic scene\ncould do the trick better.\nD) Documentaries\n1) Although the Golden Age of the documentary may be over in commercial\nradio, this is still a wonderful format for educational stations.\n2) It may be defined as a true drama, a story documented with facts and\nnames and getting much of its impact from its reality.\n3) Although many fine documentaries use material recorded in the field,\nwhen the facts are accurate events may be simulated in the studio.\nU) Above all, a documentary must have a theme, a point of view expressed\nby the narrator and \"documented” with voices, interviews or scenes.\nE) Interviews\n1) As a pattern of development. Miss Girling suggested that the producer-\nwriter prepare 5 to 7 questions for a fifteen minute program. The\nquestions might follow this pattern:\na) First question asks why guest is in this area, and discovers for\naudience something about his personality, to establish him as a\nreal, living person, not just a voice."
