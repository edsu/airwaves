It is important that they\nknow about the spectrum of programs available\nto them, and something of the people working\namong them. Those functions, however, relate\nmore directly to another discipline in the com¬\nmunications spectrum. That discipline which\naddresses itself to the projection of the \"image\"\nof the 0E0 as an agency.\nWhat this study hopes to achieve is fundamentally\nsimple. We will describe other functions for\ncommunications, responsibilities which address\nthemselves to such things as the improvement of\nthe level of services, in the face of an expanding\nsituation. We are concerned with providing better\nworking tools for Community Action Agencies, through\nthe development of new programming which is de¬\nsigned, specifically, for the mass communications\nmedia. Not in Basic Education alone, but in the\ndevelopment of program support materials in Job\nSkill Training, and in the area of describing\nsystems to overcome the isolation of entire\ncommunities in Rural America."
