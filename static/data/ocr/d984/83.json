You should receive many more benefits from your dues payments\nthan we were able to provide during the past several years. During all the\nnegotiations of the past months, we have constantly worked to achieve these\ngreater benefits for each of you and it is our hcE6st opinion that the\nprospects appear excellent for a resurgence of interest and accomplishment in\nthe areas of our mutual interests.\nYour representative on the NAEB Board will maintain these mutual\ninterests in the new organization. Any one of the five candidates can be\ncounted upon to uphold the objectives of AERT and see that they receive\nsubstantial implementation.\nSo now you, as a sort of stockholder in a small organization, become a\npart of a larger and stronger association. You are a part of a very strong\nspecialized interest group in the new organizational arrangement. You will\nreceive all the past benefits of the JOURNAL subscription as well as various\nadded services. It is the fervent wish of your officers and directors that\nthe stimuli have now been provided whereby truly gratifying results may be\nachieved. In the long run, we hope that we may regard the merger as a\nsignificant opportunity which arose in time of great need.\nSincerely yours,\nLeo Martin\nPresident\nNovember 1, 1956"
