  "text": "Dr. Harry Skornla\nOctober 13f 1959\nPage 2\nwhich the course runs a week or two with quite limited objectives or\nwhether it runs for a semester and we really try to cover all of\nMarshallâ€™s objectives (or as many is we can understand). I see no way\nto come up with anything sensible until all of these things are known\nand a design is set up.\nI am not sending Marshall a copy of this since time has forced me to\nbe a bit blunt. X did drop him a note indicating that X had written\nto Foshay about objectives and that X think Foshay should be brought\ninto the project as much as he is willing to be brought into. X wouXd\nalso say that Dick Evans should be pulled in as much as possible. He\nis a very sharp guy. Again, In both cases, this should be put on a\nprofessional basis. They ought to be remunerated for every hour they\nput in on the project, whether they are putting in that time at home,\nthinking and planning and writing or whether they are putting it in\nat meetings.\nAs l have indicated before, Harry, 1 do not want to seem to be trying\nto puncture this project. 1 think it could be tremendously interesting.\nI do think that we should be extremely careful though that we can\ndeliver whatever we promise and that the project will be of the kind\nwhich will reflect well on the NAEB and on McLuhan.\nLooking forward to seeing and talking with you in Detroit.\nBest\nSamuel L. Becker\nChairman, NAEB\nResearch Committee\nSLB:ks\ncc: William Harley"
