Our records show that it was sent on November\n21 so it has evidently been lost in the mail or is extremely slow in\nclearing customs.\nWe are sending you another copy today and we certainly hope that you\nreceive it in a reasonable length of time. If you do not, please let\nme know. We are certainly unhappy that this matter has caused you\nso much inconvenience.\nOur very best wishes to you for the coming holiday season.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Rose Schmidt\nStaff Associate"
