Wright\nDirector of Broadcasting\nStation WUOT (FM)\nUniversity of Tennessee\nKnoxville, Tennessee\nDear Kent\nNow that you* re going to spend a year at the Center, I\nassume that 1*11 have to be looking for someone else to take\nyour place on the NAEB committee. Not that I don’t want your\nnoble services, but I imagine that both you and the Center\npeople would feel that you shouldn’t be serving both during\nyour year there. There’s no hurry but I want to raise the\nquestion so that if you haven’t discussed this with yourself\nor wi th President Newburn you might want to do so sometime.\nKind personal regards.\nSincerely yours.\nFEStcu\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident"
