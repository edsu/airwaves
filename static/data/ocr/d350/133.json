Ralph, Judith Waller, Prank Dunham,\nWalter Emory, and others were in attendance. Burton\nwas there as your NAEB representative and will testify\nto the genuine miracle performed by Maddy every year.\nAs a single example, our radio equipment included five\nAmpex recorders, a new building with two control rooms,\nand two studios.\nI trust you will keep me in mind, and write when you\nhave the time.\nCordially yours,\nTom D* Rishworth"
