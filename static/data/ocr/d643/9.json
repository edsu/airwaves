I explained that you were\npresident, I a past president. I also explained my views, and\nurged him to talk with you, since, on principle, I opposed what\nhe wanted me to do anyhow. That made him all the more Insistent\non talking with me.\nWhat he wanted (and he started in on how he was so glad we\nwere to get NBC shows, l.e., NBC-ETRC; I immediately found out he\nknew little late dope, because WILL-TV is one of three which must\nget them via kine. No network facilities available) was to get\nme to testify before a Congressional committee urging exemption of\nall-channel receivers from excise tax. I said I did not oppose\nexemption of all TV sets from excise tax, but that wouldn*t help\nthe UHF-VHF problem, and that taking off one, UHF, was like taking\noff Dodge so Dodge could compete with Ford, Chevy, and Plymouth.\nIt was a pleasant, but hectic 20 minutes.\nI had b; en warned by a man high in Industry that he, Heffeman,\nwas quite an operator. I had discussed problem with Lenny Marks\na week earlier.\nActually, little likelihood that Congress will act along\nthese lines anyhow.\nRegards,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFES:nb\nCC: Skomia"
