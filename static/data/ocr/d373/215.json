Television is a primary\nmedium of communication reception for him.\nLook at some of the photographs of last summer's riots. Think\nback to some of the TV news films. Did you see any of the teenagers\nor the adults reading newspapers or books while violence was all\naround them? You did.see many, however, with transistor radios\npressed up against an ear. Radio is a primary medium of communi¬\ncation reception for them.\nWhat this means' is that television and radio are not ^ust tools\ndivorced from teaching and informing and learning and reacting, but\nare part of the entire process. What this means is that if we do\nwish to do anything about ghetto education and ghetto problems we\nhad better revolutionize our entire approach to teaching and learning\nand to public communication.\nThe child in the ghetto says he doesn't find anything interesting\nin school. What he means is that he's bored because he can't read the\nbook used as the core of instruction. We cannot teach him to read, the\nbook as we might teach children who have not suffered the psychologically\ndestructive, deprived backgrounds of many of these children. We must\nfirst reach this child to motivate him toward the personal worth and\nconfidence that will give him a base for being willing to learn. We\nmust use those means to reach him to which he is already tuned in: radio"
