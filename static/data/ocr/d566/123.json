Each\npassing week gives promise of an ever increasing improvement in the\nquantity and quality of programs offered by the network® Before spring\nwe wdll be able to distribute copies individually to all stations«\nPut all of this will cost the station some money® Practical\nexperience Jells us that none of you can program anything as cheaply,\non a per hour cost, as the network programs will contyou® It is also\nhoped, and was intended as part of the foundation grant, that by\nincluding a sizable block of NAEB programs the station could devote\nits own facilities to fewer and better programs® Many of these programs\nare of outstanding character and will be available only through tills\nnetwork service® Plans are maturing for cooperative programming by the\nme idler stations which will ultimately prove a vital stimulant to\neducational programming*"
