  "text": "The kits have been planned primari ly for in-service and pre-ser¬\nvice use by special groups. They might be used in teacher s meetings,\nseminars, workshops, and college or university classes. Though these\nmaterials perhaps speak most directly to experienced classroom teachers\nskilled in a variety of instructional procedures but unaccustomed to\nworking with television, they are intended as well for beginning teachers\nor teachers-in-training „ They have much to say also to administrators\nwho are exploring the feasibility of using instructional television in their\nschool systems or who recently have inaugurated its use.\nDifferences in locale, experience, interests, and objectives\namong the viewers suggest that, in planning the activi ties which extend\nthe filmed presentation, the program chairman will take these differences\ninto account and plan the local presentation which he considers to be\nmost effective.\nThe basic body of content in the kits is limited to the instruc¬\ntional uses of television in elementary, junior high, and high school.\nCare has been taken to avoid undue concentration on any par¬\nticular area or areas in the curriculum. Rather, emphasis is upon the\nrange and variety of television's contribution to many subject matter\nfields and to broad areas of understanding.\nEmphasis in the films is on demonstrating utilization procedures\nas they are worked out in the classroom, rather than on \"talking ABOUT\nutilization while showing only television lessons.\"\nA-2"
