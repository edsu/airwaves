This restriction has\nbeen made necessary by the large number of programs which have been\nentered in the two previous exhibitions. In order to keep the number of\nentries within the limitations of the time of the judges, only one program\nmay be entered from any series. Exhibitors, therefore, will need to make\ntheir own selection of the program in any series which has greatest merit.\nENTRY BLANKS\nThe contestants who plan to enter recordings should request additional\nentry blanks by writing to I. Keith Tyler, Ohio State University. The\nentry blanks will be sent to the contestants on and after January i, 1939-\nThe contestants will have until March 15, 1939, for selecting and recording\nthe programs which are to be entered in the exhibition.\nEXHIBIT FEE\nAn exhibit fee of fifty cents for each program is charged to cover the costs\nof the exhibition.
