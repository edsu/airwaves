She\nis one of the members of the Advisory Committee and is very enthu¬\nsiastic about our utilization kits. As you must know, she is\nMarguerite Flemming’s boss and Marguerite has been talking with\nher about plans for the pilot kit that they are developing. Eliza¬\nbeth says that this is the most significant thing she has heard\nof in the field of developing utilization and she Is thoroughly in\nfavor of the project. Her suggestion was that we not use the\nentire utilization committee as consultants but pick some members\nof the profession outside of the utilization committee. She had\nsuggested a couple of people such as Dean Melby from Michigan State\nUniversity (who made a sterling key-note address and might be\nsomeone we might like to have at a future convention) as an out¬\nside educator to work as consultant. I stressed that we would\ncertainly use consultants wherever we would find them.\nThe DAVI organization is certainly growing. I was unusually im¬\npressed with their professional approach to the educational prob¬\nlems of the day. I can remember back when they were primarily\ninterested in cleaning, splicing and projecting film. This was a\nthoroughly professional conference and I myself came away from it\nfeeling as though I had been involved in a real live-wire organiza¬\ntion. It appears that both DAVI and NAEB have come to life within\nthe last few years. In my opinion we should continue to work closely\nwith this organization.\nJust a couple of housekeeping chores.
