Dept.\nButler University\nMay 13, 1963\nMrs. Marion Corwell\nDearborn Board of Education\n5757 Neckel Avenue\nDearborn 1, Michigan\nDear Marion:\nI would suggest that the Speakers Bureau of the\nNAEB be constructed the same way as the NAB Bureau.\nIt is a good system and it works.\nMarion, perhaps it would be a good idea to preÂ¬\npare a few speeches and a fact sheet so we would have\nsome basic material to go on.\nI'm looking forward to seeing you at the next\nregional meeting of your committee.\nThe cause of Educational Broadcasting in\nIndianapolis is going at a slow rate. If you have\nany ideas I would like to hear about them.\nSincerely"
