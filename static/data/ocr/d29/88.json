Before I try to re-negotiate the contract. I'll need\nsomething snore definite than I now have. I'a through negotiating cn\nthe basis of uni-lateral (wrong) guesses. Hence, those questions far\nyour and/or Sams\n~ Hon much would wo need for Foshsy as a Consultant?\n~ How much for Cenmittee members for Gonimltattc*i# as well as travel?\n(Vfe'v© so far, I'd guess used between #300 and #1,000 of your #5,000\ntravel fund, but none of your #1,000 Consultant finds. If we'd paid\nany of Committee we'd virtually have exhausted this in one meeting.\nBut we can't expect too much from then for free, beyond what they've\ndone, and the percentage the NAEB gets would likewise soon be gc»e.\nM& need to come up with realistic guess at say #900 travel plus f 100\nper man, for subsequent meetings. How many? How much wore is needed\nfor Art Knowles? Is secretary's salary okay by her?\nBefore I re-negotiate, I need a whole new budget, in other words. I\nhad hoped for this from meeting, but know how things go. Maybe you\nshould visit 2m and/or Dick Evans at their shop to work this out.\nMeanwhile I can only tell Stone generally that we* 11 need more, without\nsaying how much more, or how such time* he'll then say he'll wait until\ndefinite figures are available. This too should be nailed dewn.\nI tend to agree with Foshsy that briefer tests should suffice. But glad\nto have this from one as wise as he is.\nAny word yet what GBC can or will do? Hie 01 agreement to try out your\nsyllabus is a fine contribution."
