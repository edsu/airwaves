Harley to the\nNAEB Executive Committee\nMarch 7, 1973\nA - Remain an independent corporation or\nB - Merge with the new structure.\nOPTION A - Maintain the NAEB as a separate professional\nsociety, minus TV station membership (and ultimately,\npossibly, radio) but retaining membership for individuals,\ninstructional systems, and industrial associates. Institutions\noperating other systems in addition to a TV station could\nhold membership in Instructional Systems and, if Radio stays\nin NAEB, in NER. Continue to provide such professional\nservices as the membership are able and willing to support;\nadd or expand such services as TOP*will contract for or\nwhich foundations might help fund.\nOPTION B - Merge NAEB with TOP, giving up its independent\ncorporate status and become a Division of Professional\nActivities, operating under a Vice President answerable to\na President, who reports to an all Lay Governing Board of\nTOP. Retain NAEB identity but with any board elected by\nthe professional membership to have only an advisory function.\nPresumably some of its professional members might attend\nmeetings of the lay board and might have one or two alternates\nwho could vote at meetings of the lay board when some of its\nmembers were absent. Budget would be determined by TOP Board\nto furnish certain professional services for the entire\nenterprise. Membership services would be continued for\nindividuals, instructional systems and industrial associates.\nCertain central services, such as accounting, bookkeeping,\nbilling, office machinery, etc. would be shared with other\ndivisions of TOP.\n* The Organization Proposed"
