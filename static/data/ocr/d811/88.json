  "text": "Dr. Maurice F. Seay, Page 2, May 12, 1959\nsalaries of the Executive Director and the Associate Director for the months\nof July and August, 1959, in carder that they may fulfill their contractual\nobligations with the University of Illinois. This, of course, refers only to\n1959, during which the change from University to NAEB administration of\nthese funds takes place. As of September 1, 1959, we will, of course,\nbegin paying these two salaries from the new grant which will be adminis¬\ntered by the NAEB Treasurer. This will complete the transfer of all Kellogg\nfunds for administration to the NAEB from the University of Illinois.\nIn view of the above, and also because many outstanding bills do not clear\nthrough the University accounting office for a month or so, we also respect¬\nfully request permission to delay filing our financial report for this final\nyear of the current Kellogg grant until September, 1959, when reports from\nthe University Auditor are available, understanding, of course, that no\ncommitments against the current grant will be made after July 1, 1959 with\nthe exception of the salary items outlined above. Any balances remaining\nat that time will be returned to the Foundation.\nIn case this request is granted, the amount of $3,868.19 (for the salaries\nlisted above for July and August, 1959) could be deducted from the first\nyear's check under the new grant.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nhjs:rs\nCCi Mr. William G. Harley"
