What¬\never he suggested was all right with the others. If anybody else wanted to go to\na show, or down to the beach, he'd first suggest it to Doc. But Doc had to give\nhis OK. If Doc was away, then maybe either Mike or Danny would decide - but as\noften as not there wouldn't be a decision.\nDoc Had Authority\nYou see. Doc had the authority in the gang; Mike and Danny were his lieuten¬\nants and each had his own following. There was a clear system of authority that\nthe gang recognized.\nEvery social group, and every society, gives to certain individuals the rl^it\nto lead the affairs. We elect officers in clubs; we have business management,\nchurch elders, town mayors. Some societies have hereditary kings; others have war¬\nrior chiefs, others place leadership in the hands of the old men. It Is necessary\nto have leadership so that necessary actions can take place.\nWhenever a group recognizes a person as its leader, two things happen. Firsts\nthey give up some of their independence. They are less free to act on their own\nbehalf, to do something they might personally enjoy doing. Second, they establish\na means by which they can cooperate effectively with the group and thereby accom¬\nplish more than they could ever do by themselves. This is true whether the group\nis interested in having a party, electing a president, building a bridge, or win¬\nning a war. There is always a problem of balancing this independence against ac¬\ncomplishment.\nSystem of Iroquois\nLet us take a brief look at the system of authority among the Iroquois Indians\nExperimental Discussion Program Subject to Revision\n33"
