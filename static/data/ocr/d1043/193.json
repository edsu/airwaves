Schooley\nTreasurer\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nMy absence from the office for several days has delayed\nthis reply to your letter of December 11.\nYou raise the question as to whether the expense stateÂ¬\nment presents any points of awkwardness. Technically, I\nsuppose, Thorton and Hunt were guests of the NAEB rather\nthan the Fund. However, since the expenditures for them\nhave been lumped in the totals, I think the only practical\nthing to do is for us to underwrite this item, as well as\nthe expenses of the invited representatives of NAEB.\nIn short, I shall simply put the statement through as is,\nfor payment and the check should be on its way shortly.\nWe too, felt that the Chicago meeting had been helpful\nall around and I am sure that within the vast dimensions\nof the total job to be done, it will be possible to sharpen\nup progressively the appropriate divisions of labor as\namong the various organizations and agencies concerned.\nMy very best.\nSincerely yours.\nG. H. Griffiths"
