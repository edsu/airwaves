Utilization is often handled by individuals who\nare unaware of the fundamental or basic characteristics and affective effects of the media.\nSuch individuals necessarily concern themselves in teaching solely with superficial and\nobvious uses which grow out of an essentially amateur approach. If maximum use of\nthese media is to be made it is urgent that a body of information be developed which will\nprovide a solid foundation for such courses , not based on guesswork or assumed transfer\nof common elements from other media.\nSerious scholars now recognise that a large proportion of the effects of television\nand radio are often unintentional or unintended ones.
