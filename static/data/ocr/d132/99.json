Caspar Hauser\nis a symbol; he is the human being, pure, undefiled—endowed with great natural\ntalents and almost superhuman sensitiveness. The story is laid against a vivid\npanorama of Europe in the Nineteenth Century with an introduction written\nespecially for the American edition by the author. Caspar Hauser, that strange\nfigure which puzzled Europe when he first appeared, until he met his inexplicable\ndeath, has remained an unsolved mystery to this day. $4.95\nSeven Plays\nBY ERNST TOLLER\n(With an introduction by the Author)\nComprising, “The Machine-Wreckers,” “Transfiguration,” “Masses and Man,”\n“Hinkemann,” “Hoppla! Such is Life,” “The Blind Goddess,” “Draw the Fires!”\nand “Mary Baker Eddy”—each play is a serious reflection of a worthy and\nintelligent dramatist on the impact which life had shaken him. Almost all\nthe plays cry out with what Toller thought to be an inadequate social system for\nthe working-class. $4.95\nAlfred Adler\nThe Man and His Work\nBY HERTHA ORGLER\nAlfred Adler is best known for his discovery of the “inferiority complex”\nand “individual psychology” the most fruitful approach to personality problems.\nThe author describes how Adler’s life and work were inter-related and makes\nhim live for her readers. The account of the “incurable burglar” who was cured\nby Adler is spellbinding. A must for parents and teachers! $5.95"
