  "text": "■6-\nMembership on such committees shall not include Board members except\nwhere the qualifications of the Board member warrant his membership„\nThe President of NAEB shall be an ex officio member of all committees.\nThe Executive Director shall be an ex-officio member of all such Head¬\nquarters committees c,\nThe Secretary and Treasurer shall be considered as Headquarters\nofficers for operational purposes.\nC* The Regions shall hold yearly meetings and funds shall be made\navailable to support such meetings. Why not hold the regional meeting\neach year before the NAEB Convention? It could be spotted geographi¬\ncally between the majority location of the regional stations and the\nlocation of the convention. The Director could thus use the Regional\nMeeting to get the \"grass roots\" feeling and opinion of the membership,\nThe Board meeting that follows will then reflect the feeling and wishc\nof the whole membership. In connection with this, would it not be\npossible for the Executive Director (upon order from the President) to\nfurnish Regional Directors with an agenda early enough before each\nBoard meeting to allow the Directors to contact the membership on vita,\nquestions to be discussed? This would allow the membership a direct\nand continuing expression of opinion on policy matters,\nCONCLUSION:\nThat’s the blueprint, born out of general concern for the welfare\nof the NAEB. Many people have contributed to my thinking, but should\nnot bear any responsibility for its inadequacies. Sy Siegel*s driving\npower has set us far along the road that Dick Hull, George Probst, Par¬\nser Wheatley, Allen Miller, and many others have dreamed and nurtured.\nThere’s a lot of Graydon’s concern here and much of Jim Miles’ keen\nanalysis. Discussions with many of the members have contributed much.\nJohn Dunn lit the match that fired the whole thing. The blame is mine"
