For this fee members\nrecoil our monthly Newsletters the$ various reports and surveys we publish\nperiodically; services of our Placement Service, television engineer, legal\ncounsel, management consultant, etc.; plus the normal day to day services,\ninformation, and advice that any national organisation gives its members.\nUnder separate cover we are sending you samples of some of the materials\nwe regularly send our members, plus other items which will give you more\ninformation about the Association. Of course. Associate and Affiliate mem¬\nbers do not receive as many of these materials as regularly as Active mem¬\nbers do*\nIn addition. Active members with radio stations may use the facilities of\nthe MASS Radio network upon payment of an annual assessment foe. The Het-\nwork distributes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape record¬\ning, weekly, to members subscribing to its service. This fee is also based\non power (with the same power classifications as membership) and a new sta¬\ntion does not have to pay the full foe until the third year it is in the\nNetwork. The fees ares\n3rd year\nGlass A\n500.00\n300.00\nClass B\nClass C\n251.00\n150.00\n375.00\n225.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from\nNetwork Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A sta¬\ntion paying its full third-year rate is plying only a little over £2.00\nan hour for better than 400 hours of programming from the Network in a\nyear. This is about the most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf, after you have a chance to look over the materials we're sending, you\nhave any questions, I shall be most happy to answer the®, and I'm sure\nMr. Mamet would welccrae an opportunity to talk with you about HU58 mem¬\nbership.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHtjy\nEnclosures\ncct Mr. Henry Manet\nMr. John Schwarswalder, Director, MAEB Region V"
