This requires an intelligence of a high practical\norder that is not reflected in the verbal orientcd-cultural achievement\nevaluations we call IQ tests. It is the kind of ability many industry\npeople say they are looking for, but somehow have not yet really\nprovided opportunities for.\nThe intelligence and potential are clearly there. They must be\nâ€¢motivated and matured through communications and education. They must\nbe communicated witn and given an opportunity to communicate.\nBut it is not enough to educate the ghetto child so that he is\nable to make the contributions he is capable of. It is necessary to\neducate white suburbia to provide unconditional, open, free and equal\nopportunity for all contributions for the progress of our country,\nregardless of the source. It is necessary to educate all children,\nregardless of background, to meet the special demands of the society\nthey are living in and will live in.\nConsider the fact that knowledge doubles every six years: between\nsecond-grade\ntoday and the time my/child is my age, 97% of the knowledge in the\nworld will be new. We cannot meet the child's needs with horse and\nbuggy educational techniques and philsophies."
