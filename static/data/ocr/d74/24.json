  "text": "Harold E. Hill\nMarch 27, 1961\nPage 2\nUniversity did a study for NBC a few years ago on what has happened\nto the radio audience — patterns of listenings, etc. There is some\ninteresting material which has never been released. 1 would assume\nthat enough time has passed so that he could do a paper on it with*\nout getting into trouble with NBC ** and the material is still quite\npertinent.\n5. The University of Indiana Press is bringing out a book on \"The Great\nDebates\" this coming January. Included will be a series of studies\nwhich were done on the effect of the debates on voters, etc. A very\ngood program could be built from this. The one to contact would be\nthe editor of the book, Dr. Sidney Kraus, Department of Radio and\nTelevision, University of Indiana. I am sure that he would be happy\nto pull together such a program.\n6. Tom Coffin, Director of Research for NBC has been concerned for some\ntime with new directions which media research •• broadcasting re*\nsearch, specifically — ought to take. He is bright, well*trained,\nand has given this much thought. Should be able to do a good paper,\nbringing the audience up to date on the advances made in going beyond\nnose*counting and then pointing out additional needs.\nThat dies me out. If I have other ideas, I will ship them right on.\nGood seeing you ** even briefly ** in Washington.\nBest,\nSLB:ks\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
