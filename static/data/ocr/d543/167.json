  "text": "Fromi Harry J. Skornia\nDates February 12* 19$9\nYou811 recall our technical service (with Bidlaek) application to Hill-SXliott.\nA contract was offered us tc do this and conduct a conference* for not over\nt8,£00oQ0, including conference« After talking to various engineers and others^\nwe declined, No funds for travel* etc. And we were afraid of a standards-\nsetting study based on questionnaires* inadequate evidence, etc. They agree.\nThey011 now try to give some additional money to Phil. Lewis to have him incor¬\nporate into the EIA book he0s now doing, whatever he can. His manuscript will\nbe sent to us, and others, to catch ’‘bugs,” Ke already has all our materials\n(on closed circuit TV, setting up an IM station, etc,)\nThe attached is in answer to a phone call from Stone yesterday. Others\nwould like to run such a conference, They0d like to have us do, I{'m trying\nto convince him to include radio, as you1311 notice. Since this conference\nwill be held, whether we«ll hold or not, I0ve tried to design in such a way\nthat it will strengthen such applications as Schwarzwalder8 s and others.\nSorry, in my haste, I left out USDS people. Please let me have your other\nideas, for people and topics and organisations, I think, as I said in the\nletter, that a committee should help in planning. We011 do all we can here\nsingle-handed, but this had better be good.\nSuggestions will be eagerly watched for.\nRegards to all.\nHJSiJO\ncc: Richard B. Hull"
