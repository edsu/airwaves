  "text": "Dear Warren:\nEnclosing the proposals you sent and my summaries. Half of them\nare here and the other half are coming in another envelope.\nThis was a frustrating job in many ’ways. First of all, as you\nknow, procedures are not clearly defined in most of the proposals,\nif they are touched upon at all. Except for a very few, there\n■were nothing but vague references to the hypotheses to be\ntested. I^B^Siehihat most of thesp problems were clarified\nin conference with the experimentgrbefore grants were made but\nthis is not reflected in these proposals - except for the\nilliteracy one. Host provide no information on sample size\nor, in a number of cases?, on composition of the sample.\nAnyway, I did the best I could to make them sound sensible.\nI thought that sending me the McLuhan proposal to abstract\nwas an especially low blow ill\nThe only other problem that I had was in the classification\nscheme. Wien the emphasis was on in-service training of\nteachers as they are teaching in public schools (as a number\nof these were) , I put ML for institutional level and TE for\ncontent level (e.g., as in proposals 269 and 2^3) 1 where the\ncourse content was not indicated. When it was, as in the\nlanguage proposal, I put that. ‘3s\nI hope that you find these satisfactory. If not, please let me\nknow.\nBest\netc.\nVyBy the way§ these will look longer than they really are because\ni they were typed on our large-type electric typewriter. With\n(standard type, they would take up much less of the page."
