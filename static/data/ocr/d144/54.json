There is no one in organiza¬\ntion management who cannot be exposed to a\nnew idea—acquire a new skill through the inter¬\nchange of ideas. This is why ASAE is an im¬\nportant part of my business and professional\nlife.—Robert H. North, CAE, Executive Secre¬\ntary, International Association of Ice Cream\nManufacturers.\nI have found that a good number of the\narticles in Association Management deal with\nthe problems that I am faced with in my own\nassociation, and that these have been most help¬\nful in solving my own problems or giving me\nthoughts that lead to the solution of some of\nthese problems.—R. H. Hering, Executive Vice\nPresident, American Society of Travel Agents,\nInc.\n... We are returning material borrowed from\nASAE’s Management Library. These publica¬\ntions, plus others I examined personally in\nWashington, produced many nuggets of gold\nfor us. They helped us put together a Policy\nManual which has won great praise.—John\nAuerbach, Executive Secretary, Bicycle Institute\nof America, Inc.\nI truly believe ASAE will grow stronger in\nproportion to the strength of its affiliated groups.\nI hope ASAE will continue to give them ideas\non holding better meetings and encourage them\nto use ASAE more fully as a clearing house of\ninformation. — Clive Bradford, General Man¬\nager, Colorado Automobile Dealers Association."
