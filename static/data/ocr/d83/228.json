Barzun is con¬\ncerned with what he calls a thought-cliche7, and has\nmuch relevant material. Incidentally, on p.54, he\nsays* \"the prevelance of the thought-cliche does more\nthan misinform; it weakens attention, curiosity, and\nthe critical sense. Where all is familiar, nothing\narrests gliding and starts thought.\" On p.38\n\"middlemen, producers, and customers are but reproducing\nin mind-stuff what the material world gives them as\nmodels.\"\nNow these two statements, Hariy, say what I am\nsaying about media. The first one says that as a form\nis familiar it is subliminal and unawares. It does\nnot seem to occur to Barzun that the form of print\nor radio could, of itself, act as a thought cliche—\nyet, in his other remark about models and mind-stuff,\nhe is arguing that the patterns of consciousness are\nstructured by technology. Barzun argues (pp.5-6)\nthat The House of Intellect is based on the alphabet.\nPeople can be intelligent without literacy, but the\nintellectual is formed by the modes of the printed word\nexclusively. That is why he is prepared to proclaim\nArt, Science and Philanthropy as the enemies of intellect.\nIn a word, Barzun is himself unaware of the ways in which\nwriting and printing have structured our civilization\nquite independently of their content. He writes like the\nEnglish Colonel in the Bridge Over the River Kwai.\ncontinued"
