This committee, working with the director of\ndevelopment would draw up and promote a national plan for the develop¬\nment of ETV, while, at the same time, seeking funds needed•\n— Other \"promotional\" activities could also be included and directed\nby the director of development, such as•* a White House Conference on\nETV; a major promotional campaign; continue to promote and support\nFederal aid to ETV; form an Industry for ETV committee to enlist\nsupport and financial aid of business and industry; etc#\n-- The first year would, of necessity, be devoted laregly to organi¬\nzation of backing and financial support• This would be followed by\na concentrated campaign (much along the lines discussed with Went¬\nworth and Smith) to overcome the obstacles currently limiting the\nexpansion of ETV. Such a campaign would include enlargement and\ncontinuation of activities indicated in the paragraph immediately above,\nplus other \"informational\" activities, aimed especially at the public•\n-- The next logical step will be the actual program of assisting new\nstations to get on the air; development of improved techniques, especially\nfor instructional television; development (or at least encouragement)\nof better teacher-training programs to incorporate ETV into the educational\nsystem of the United States; improvement of the professional standards\nand -qualifications of those involved in educational broadcasting - the\nbroadcasters themselves, teachers (both classroom and studio), etc•\n— As the most competent organization to carry out the above longrange\nplan, the NAEB would serve as the guiding and coordinating group, but\nwould call upon other or anizat ions -existing and to be formed (as\nindicated above) - to carry out most of the specific steps of the\nplan. The general supervision of t he entire project would, in other\nwords, be handled by the NAEB, with the Associat ion then assigning\nthe various tasks and fund ions to others in extistence or creating\nnew functional organizations where necessary• A great deal could, of\ncourse, be done by expaning the NAEB itself, if the funds are available,\nbut the public relations value might be greater if the NAEB merely\nserved as indicated in a coordinating and \"steering \" role•"
