This tyranny, imposed by Soviet Russia in\nflagrant violation of her solemn guarantees, precludes\nthe enduring world peace desired by free men every¬\nwhere. The National Committee is the American peo¬\nple’s answer to the Kremlin’s despotic rule.\nA Program of Action\nThe Committee seeks:\nTo pierce the Iron Curtain with messages of moral\nand practical value through the facilities of Radio Free\nEurope, thus taking the fight to the enemy’s camp.\nTo build for the future by educating young refugees\nfrom Communism and to preserve the cultural heri¬\ntage of the past which the enemy seeks to destroy.\nTo develop political unity and a dynamic platform\nof aims and principles among the exile groups.\nTo assemble and distribute knowledge about current\nconditions in the captive area.\nTo create active public support, both moral and ma¬\nterial, for these activities.\nThe Record to Date\n1( RADIO FREE EUROPE\nRadio Free Europe is a forceful\nweapon in the battle for men’s\nminds. It shatters the isolation\nwhich the Kremlin seeks to impose\non the people of Czechoslovakia,\nHungary, Poland, Albania, Bul¬\ngaria and Romania. As a private\nstation unhampered by diplomatic\nconsiderations, it hits hard. Over\nRFE, exiles from the prisoner states speak directly to\ntheir countrymen behind the Iron Curtain.\nIn two years RFE’s program schedule has grown\nfrom IVi hours to a daily total of 57 hours. RFE is\nin direct competition with the domestic Communist\nstations in its target countries. Five transmitters have\nbeen erected in Germany, 5 in Portugal and 4 more\nwill soon be installed. The largest is 14 times more\npowerful than the strongest U. S. domestic station."
