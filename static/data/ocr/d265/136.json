Was Jefferson untrue to his own philosophy in characterizing the newspapers\nas untrustworthy during his presidency, when they were attacking him?\n7. What remedies did he suggest for the alleged abuses of the freedom of the\npress? Can you suggest better ones?\n8. In which of the following hypothetical cases would you regard it as most\nimportant to defend the freedom of the press (or radio):\n(1) When a California newspaper urges emphasis on Europe rather than Asia\nin the \"cold war\";\n(2) When somebody described somebody in the State Department as a homoÂ¬\nsexual;\n(3) When somebody in Minnesota condemns the farm policy of the Administration\n(1) When anybody in the United States urges the admission of Communist China\nto the United Nations;\n(5) When a radio commentator criticizes the President for playing too much\ngolf.\n9. What limitations on freedom of discussion that you know of are now imposed on\nradio programs? Are there any that do not result from regulations?\n10. Would you say that in political reporting and the like, the newspapers show\nbetter manners now than they did in Jefferson's day? Any examples?\n11.

If so, how would you explain it?\nSuggested Reading List\nText of the radio program as given in The Jeffersonian Heritage, Ch.
