Tettemr\nDirector of School Programs\nStation KTCA-TV\nTwin City Area Educational\nTelevision Corporation\nSt* Paul 8, Minnesota\nDear Clair:\nHarry, just before leaving for Washington. asked m to write to you regarding\nyour earlier exchange of correspondence relative to your spending some time on\ngetting the utilisation kit project “off the ground*”\nWe have a little left in the fund originally given to us by Ford for consul¬\ntation purposes, and this seems to be a legitimate use of these funds. ¥e\ncould probably go up to $1,000 total.\nHowever, we need to have from you an outline of what you would propose to do,\nyour intended itinerary and a budgetary breakdown of how the funds would be\nexpended. We feel that it is essential that some real progress be made (as\nyou do), and we would hope that actual kit material might be a result of your\ninitial work — we feel that laying the ground-work for future activity might\nnot be enough, because we Slight not get any more money, in which case we»d\nknow a little better what we wanted to do but would be unable to do it.\nTour project might even be construed as a \"pilot” project to determine exactly\nwhat can be done (with kit materials actually developed in the process), which\nwe could then use to prepare a request to the USOE for !CDEA funds to enlarge\nupon the “pilot.”\nLet me know what you thinly and, if possible, rough out your plans, itinerary\nand budget.\nCordially,\nHEH: jp\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
