The\ncategories of work remaining arei\n1. A written prospectus outlining a graded sequence of\nlanguage structures to be used in fifteen-minute\nbroadcast programs from the elementary through the\nadvanced level. She prospectus should include a\nsystematic statement of intonation, stress, Juncture,\nand pronunciation that may be developed in conjunction\nwith the sequence of structures and with the fifteen-\nminute program units.\n2. Sixty-five completed fifteen-minute radio scripts\nfor a basic English course. This will be based cm\nthe written prospectus and will enable detailed\nstatements of the contextual situations to be used\nin each of the scripts as well as clear statements\nof what is to be learned or accomplished in each of\nthese programs.\nOur time schedule for this work requires the submission of all the\nmaterials by December 31, 19^3, Iwfc ve have assurance from the\ncontracting officer of the United States Information Agency that we\nwill have some flexibility here and can probably figure at least two\nor three months into 1964 as a more reasonable terminal date for the\nmaterials*"
