Bach week I*ve been in Washington. Leave\nagain Monday AM via East Lansing for all week there. Time\nleft for what I should do is all to little.\nI bought Number. I need to finish reading it. Will take in\nmy brief case next time, to get at least what you were driving\nat in the section you suggested.\nI trust you are beginning to pull together your project for\nthe termination and final report, due on or about July 1. I\nmention this because I plan to take July as vacation. Tried\nto last year, but it became riddled with \"must\" meetings.\nThis year Lee and I (Mary will stay here in July and take a\nvacation she likes, later) plan to go camping„ we've decided\nto try to find a good spot among the lakes of Ontario. We*11\ngo up via Niagara Falls, which Lee hasn't seen. If you're\naround in early July perhaps we could drop in to say !!hello.\"\nNot quite sure of exact date, but would let you know — and\n^wouldn't want to interfere with any plans you have. If we do —\nplease tell me how to find you. Toronto is just a big confusion,\nas far as directions etc. are concerned."
