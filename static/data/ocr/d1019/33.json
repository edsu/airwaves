Be suggested that I reply directly to you.\nPerhaps I should first answer your question about support. We're\nlargely self-supporting (member dues, publications etc.). We earlier\n)mri some Ford project-by-project grants,shut have none now. We’re\npretty independent, which may explain this in part. Not having lavish\nbudgets or staff we get pretty good mileage out of our money, since we\ncan usually call on our loyal committees members* institutions for tal¬\nent and help.\nNot knowing what Bob talked to you about, precisely, let me here con¬\ncentrate on possible research into radio’s effectiveness. As you know\nwe’ve published known data on this (based on Wisconsin, Riiladelphia\nPublic School findings) and have a research sumtaary-inventory nearly\nready for publication. But we've done no studies.\nI think we could most econccdLcally do some as research grants-in-aid.\nShe University of Wisconsin and several others, with both rW and radio\ncould probably carry these out. We would announce the availability of\nfunds, accept applications for review and selection by our Research com¬\nmittee, and supervise the project(e). I would think something on the\norder of $5,000.00 per such study would be adequate. If 2 or more were\npossible (in different parts of the country, or in different subjects\nor grade levels), I believe results would be better. For $20,000, I\nbelieve we could do a three-location study, and have enough to cover"
