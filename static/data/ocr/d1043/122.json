The enclosed letter\nfrom Bob may be of Interest to you. He also sent me a copy\nof a letter which he sent to Seymour, which I am also enclosing.\nThe convention committee met in East Lansing last week. Plans\nare progressing very well. It sounds to me like it should be\na very satisfactory meeting, with most of the sessions in the\nform of town hall meetings for general membership.\nCordially yours,\nQJlrloV'\nWA:cfo Waldo Abbot, Director\nEncs. 3 Region III"
