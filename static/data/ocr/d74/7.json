WRIGHT\nDirector, Radio and Television\nUniversity of Tennessee\nI have an NAEB assignment on which I need your\ncooperation and counsel. Will you help me to identify\nthe current and potential centers of educational tele¬\nvision activity in your state?\nYou are, no doubt, aware of the study currently\nbeing conducted by the NAEB of nation-wide educational\nneeds for TV spectrum space. I have been designated as\none of the Regional Consultants through whom the field\nwork will be done. It is our problem to survey present\nand future plans of educational institutions and agencies\nwith respect to television and the need for channel allo¬\ncations. We have until approximately April 1st to complete\nthis phase of the study.\nThe area for which I am responsible includes Iowa,\nIllinois, Indiana and Michigan, as well as Wisconsin.\nWithin that area, obviously, my first task is to identify\nthe key institutions ( and people) which are concerned\nwith current and future applications of television to the\nsolution of education’s problems. This is where I need\nyour advice.\nWhich institutions, agencies or departments in\nyour state are currently using TV to good advantage?\nWhich, to your knowledge, are making plans for\nexpansion or incorporation of TV into their programs\nof instructionf ( And by ’’plans71, we mean hopes and\ndreams, as well as budgeted requests.)\nIn either category, to whom should I address an\ninquiry for information?"
