  "text": "VII.\nVIII.\n- 8 -\nSCORES FROM CANADA\nThe several scores submitted by the CBC, some of them very\ninteresting, have been carefully examined. They do not, however, fall\nwithin the strictly defined brief for the 20th Century Seasons, since\nCBC could offer recordings of them through normal EBU programme exchange\nchannels. Already one or two members of the Working Party have expressed\nthe hope that such offers will be forthcoming from the CBC, anticipating\nconsiderable interest on the part of respective radio stations.\nMEW IDEAS\n(a) The Working Party thought that it might be a good,if complex\nideasto invite all subscribers to investigate which of the substantial\nworks by the great masters they had neglected over the last 2 or 3 years\nThe statistical evidence would then be collated and one or more concerts\nconstructed within the framework of the EBU Concert Seasons which would\nentirely consist of such universally neglected, important works. In\nthe course of this operation, one might even find common causes of such\nneglect, and include observations on them in the presentation.\n(b) The Working Party discussed a possible project falling right\noutside its own terms of reference and indeed outside the EBU Concert\nSeasons, viz, the possibility of single co-promotions by various and\nvarying combinations of radio organizations: both culturally and\nfinancially, there seem to be great opportunities in this - the strictly\nmusical - area, where the national divisions between radio stations are\nnot really meaningful."
