It is because Ken will shortly terminate\nhis consultancy that I am writing. The beginnings tTuftHtelTas\nmade are significant. I think it necessary that these~Wg$nninrs\nnot only be continued but be expanded.\nStrong as eloquent speeches and meaningful conferences\nmay be, your special reports are the strongest possible testimony\non our behalf in programing designed for the disadvantaged. I\nhope you will give the continuance of this project a priority\nposition in your plans for the next several months.\nSincerely,\nEdward J.
