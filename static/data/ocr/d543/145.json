The remarkable turn-out for your R gion testifies not\nonly to your personal initiative and leadership but to a growing\ninterest and inclination to participate in the affairs of HAEB.\nI regret that I did not have time to shake your hand and\nconvey all of the above to you in person before I left, but, as\nI trust Harry told you, my departure was rather precipitous. I\nbelieve I indicated to you the possibility that I might be able\nto get over to Chapel Hill but this was contingent upon a long\nseries of airline connections across the country. I didnâ€™t get\nfinal clearance until almost the very last second; hence, I had to\nleave in a rush to catch the plane.\nI'm sure that my absence was not felt and that it in no way\nindicated any lack of interest or concern for the success of the\nConference; my part in it was largely concluded with the morning\nsession and, anyway, good old Harry was there to hold down the\nheadquarters representation. By leaving early I had the chance\nto visit Chapel Hill, which I felt I might not be apt to get to\nfor a long, long time, if ever*\nAgain, thanks for your hospitality and a resounding whack on\nthe back for a superb job*\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley"
