Novik\n300 West 23rd Street\nRoom 500\nNew York 11, New York\nDear Maury:\nJust a brief note relative to a possible renewal, for a second year of our\nagreement with you for your services as NAEB Management Consultant.\nI notice that, in the one bill you have submitted for services for the six\nmonth period April 1 - September 30, 1954, you apparently did not charge us\nthe $75.00 per diem for days spent outside your office in the service of\nNAEB. Since any funds which we may be able to secure for continuing this\nservice are likely to be limited, I wonder if you will be agreeable to conÂ¬\ntinue to forego the per diem and bill u s only for the agreed retainer\n($2500.00) per annum) and actual expenses incurred.\nIf this is agreeable, we will attempt to set the Management Consultant\nService up on the same fiscal basis as our other accounts, i.e., July 1-\nJune 30, and take steps to assure funds to June 30, 1956.\nWe do not want to appear to be going back on our original offer, but I\nbelieve you understand our problems, and I would appreciate your honest\nreacti n to the above.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHEH/HJS/cp\nP.S. How do you spell Morrie? Merry Xmas"
