When decisions are made regarding\nthe use of television in your classroom or school system, it is well to\nbear in mind that television can work in these different ways, and that\na very important aspect of the decision-making function is to determine\nwhich level of support is most appropriate to your own situation. Cru¬\ncial to the success of instructional television is a clear understanding\nas to just what use is envisioned for it and what role it is expected and\ndesigned to play in a particular school situation. While this use is\nlisted below as three distinct levels, in practice there are many degrees\nof classroom support stretching from Level 1 to Level 3.\nLevel 1 The classroom teacher is responsible for the major course\nor study unit content, butuses television for the special materials which\nare difficult or impossible for individual teachers to provide.\nHere television is a plus factor rather than an integral partofthe\nmain stream of the course. Though the television programs may follow\nthe course direction in a general way, their primary purpose is to sup¬\nplement and enrich, to provide the kind of fruitful experiences which\nare stimulating and evocative but practical ly inaccessible to the regular\nclassroom. Used at this level, television^ primary aim is to extend the\ndimensions of the classroom toward increased experience, enhanced ap¬\npreciation, or heightened interest.\nH-3"
