Acda\n[Head, Central Programme Service\nIRadio Nederland Wereldomroep\nhs^S^eliruTSe w eg ?6----â€”\nHliversum , Nederland\nDear John:\nWe are all captives of technology!\nMy newest pride and joy is a tiny tape recorder which I take about\nwith me on my travels, dictating as I go. On my way to Samoa (where\nNAJEB did a feasibility study of TV for schools) I had a couple of hours to\nwait in the Los Angeles Airport and proceeded to dictate some letters,\nincluding a long and brilliant one to you, sir.\nI promptly mailed the carton back to the office and assumed that\nthis scintillating epistle had long ago reached you. Upon returning to the\noffice, however, I discovered to my dismay that the secretary was unable\nto get the contents of my letter to you off of the tape. Evidently the\nbatteries were low and the machine was running so slowly that my words\nwere lost in the mud.\nHence, I am starting over again and will attempt to reconstruct\nwhat I said earlier*\nOur engineers have checked or er your letter advising on the best\nequipment and methods to receive the Radio Nederland broadcasts and\nfeel that the information should be useful. Accordingly, we are distributing\ncopies to all the stations attempting to make the short-wave pickup.\nMichigan is obtaining pretty good reception in the meaning but\nhaving difficulty with the afternoon transmissions. At any rate, we will\ncontinue to experiment and persevere because we very much want this\nexperiment to work out and are determined to do our utmost to that end."
