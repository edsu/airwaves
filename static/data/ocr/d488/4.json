The somewhat belated December issue of our new Membership Newsletter plus\nthe January-February issue* It is our thought, that in months to come these News¬\nletters may be of assistance to you in arranging membership campaigns In your cwn\nareas*\n2* A list of staff members of schools and colleges in your regions which\noffer courses in radio and television. Please note that this list contains names\nof people who are not presently members of AERT. It seems safe to assume that\na lot of these folks will want to .join as soon as you contact them. This list\nthen, will go along with the list of heads of departments of the same schools and\ncolleges* This latter list was sent to\"'you late last fall,\n3® A relatively up—to-date list of those who presently are AERT members plus\nnames of people and institutior|that subscribe to the AERT Journal* This should\nbe helpful to you in that it will indicate those you need not contact.\nh. A sample copy of the mimeographed AERT membership blank. It is our sug¬\ngestion that you have copies made of this and sent out to potential members within\nyour regions.\n5- A sample letter which we are using in this office to send to potential\nmembers. We suggest that you have s5.milar covering letters sent to potential mem¬\nbers along with a copy of the membership blank. The covering letter should con¬\nsider many of the advantages of membership plus the objectives of AERT and should\nin effect be an ”invitation” to join."
