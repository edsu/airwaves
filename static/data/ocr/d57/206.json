I assumed that you only make grants to educational instituÂ¬\ntions; we, however, are an educational institution with nonprofit tax\nexempt status. Also we have a permanent staff capable of carrying\nthrough a proposal to completion. Furthermore we have a number\nof very competent people in the radio and television fields here in\nWashington who serve as advisors to us in such matters.\nWe will develop a proposal and send it to you this fall.\nThe proposal, however, would be for the development for a series\nto be done by us.\nSincerely,\nUk. .\nEvron M.
