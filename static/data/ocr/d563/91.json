  "text": "Much of the series (and its title) stems from a\nbook Brinton wrote in 1938, but Brinton found\nthe series’ preparation as strenuous as working\nout a new high-level course at Harvard. Although\nthe series is primarily for general viewers, it is\nalso offered for credit toward the Adjunct in Arts\ndegree that Harvard University grants to quali¬\nfied men and women in the Boston area.\nIn addition to Brinton’s own preparation and\nresearch, Larsen and Jacques Kornberg, a grad¬\nuate assistant, have scoured libraries, museums,\nand rare-book collections for such material as ex¬\ncerpts from films of twentieth-century revolu¬\ntions, original newspapers from eighteenth- and\nnineteenth-century revolutions, and relics like\nship money, revolutionary pamphlets, and a red\narmband from the Russian Revolution. The series\nturns on a thesis developed by Brinton over many\nyears of study: Many, if not most, of the revolu¬\ntions in modern history have distinctive elements\nin common (for example, they are neither wholly\nspontaneous nor wholly plotted) and thus the his¬\ntorian can study revolutions with scientific meth¬\nods. Professor Brinton’s series, then, is an exhibit\nof scholarly insight. Yet the medium permits him\nto employ his characteristic urbanity and wit.\nBeing “spiked” (directed where to stand) in a\nwindowless, equipment-strewn studio, Brinton\nmaintains his good humor. And during one re¬\nhearsal, no one in the studio laughed louder than\nProfessor Brinton himself when, instead of the\nterm “underground revolutions,” he said “un¬\ndergraduate revolutions. ’ ’"
