  "text": "6\nto accommodate already existing requests for funds. You probably are also\naware that fiscal 1970 is the last year authorized under the extension in\nTitle I of the Public Broadcasting Act, and that it will therefore be\nnecessary to seek from the new Congress an additional extension of authority.\nLet's consider just one other fiscal fact of life which we must face up\nto in 1969: the state limitation. Title I, as amended, makes the state\nlimit 8%% of the appropriation per year...that is, no state in any fiscal\nyear may receive more than of the amount appropriated for that year.\nFor 1969, the state limit will be $340,000. That amount is not a guarantee\nnor an \"allotment\" - just a limitation; and radio as well as TV must be\naccommodated within those figures. Now: among the applications already\non hand, the average Federal grant requested is $600,000. And there are\nat least 6 states in which competing applications currently on file exceed\nthe possible state limitations for several years to come.\nThis subject is painful enough, so that I decline to go on describing\nthe horns of the dilemma which confronts us. I should imagine that is\nenough to explain why it is not possible for our unit merely to go back\nto the good old days and resume processing ETV applications where we left\noff.\nWe have $4,000,000 to work with for fiscal 1969. And we realize that\nwe may be unpopular in some eyes after that four million becomes obligated.\nI suppose there is no \"right\" way to obligate that $4,000,000 - that is,\nno way which will please everybody. Conversely, I suspect, there is no\n\"wrong\" way either. Not when the obvious needs already on record so far\noutstrip the resources; that is, the dollars will hot be wasted on \"frills\"\nor \"unnecessary\" projects, no matter how they are spent."
