This went with\nsix Journals and an equal number of member¬\nship blanks.\nI'll get another letter off to.him answering\nhis specific questions, but first I'd like\nyour opinion on framing an answer to the\nlocal chapter issue. Also, do you think it\nexpeditious to go into too much detail as far\nas current membership figures are concerned?\nI'll also send him a copy of the present\nmembership in his state ... as soon as the\nthings are run off.\nPlease let me have the copy of my letter to\nhim back again. It’s the only copy I have.\njar"
