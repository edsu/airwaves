K. Kellogg Foundation\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Bob#\nHerewith the revised budget you requested, incorporating the new Kellogg\ngrant and revising for the balance of the year*\nWe would appreciate haring this report considered ®confidential,® and I\nam distributing copies only to the HAEB Executive Gaamittee. I do feel\nthat the generosity of the Kellogg Foundation and the peculiarly close\nrelationship between the MAE® and the Foundation deserve all the d@~\ntail provided in the footnotes, with reeogriiss^le frankness.\nBefore this report is formally reviewed by your organisation, if that is\nnecessary* I should like to discuss it with you orally, and answer any\nquestions which may occur to you between receipt of this report and\nmy visit there next week.\nIn view of the fact that the Center is holding a meeting at East\nLansing concurrently with the WAC meeting I1 a attending there, but\nextending over through Sferch 17, it appears that I will not now be\nable to visit you until rather late afternoon March 17. WS.H this be\nsatisfactory? I shall be bringing my car to facilitate the transportation\nproblem*\nUnder separate cover I am. also forwarding to you revised lists of materials\nnow available from JfAEB and the first of several new ff operations reports\nmeeting in Eugene, Oregon.\nWtaaast regards, and I shall expect to see you March 17, unless I hear from\nyou (at the Kellogg Center at MSG) to the contrary.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSims\nEnclosure\ncos Executive Committee"
