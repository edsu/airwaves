Skelley, of the California State Department of Educa¬\ntion, stated:\n\"One of the basic problems in providing educational facilities\nis that of land space as well as classroom buildings. Adequate\navailability of television channels, both high-power, which\nwould facilitate multiple channel use could reduce the exist¬\ning need for educational opportunities for students. This con¬\ncept would involve at least one high-power station in each metro¬\npolitan area, plus four or five low»pover multiple channels.\nThe basic presentation of knowledge and information relative to\ncertain subject material fields could be programmed and free\nteachers for necessary follow-up. There will be need for many\ntelevision channels for instruction in the future; they must\nbe reserved now.”\nFrom the fifty state superintendents or their deputies polled in\nthe survey concerning the instructional needs which would be satisfied\nor improved by the use of broadcast television, the following responses\nwere received:\nTable 4\nL,\nBroadcast television instruction could satisfy\nand improve the enrichment of present instruc¬\ntion, provide instruction on current affairs,\nand provide a source of motivation 5\nBroadcast television can meet needs in all\nareas of elementary and secondary education 43\nBroadcast television can meet curriculum de¬\nficiencies at the junior college level and pro¬\nvide credit courses for community college 16\nBroadcast television can meet pressing needs\nin adult education 23\nNeeds will increase drastically during the\nnext ten years 48\nNeeds will not increase noticeably in the\nnext ten years 1\nThere is planned use, or planned expansion\nof use, of broadcast television in the\nstate 44\nThere is no planned use of broadcast\ntelevision in the state 1\nThere is planned expanded use of closed-\ncircuit television in the state 1"
