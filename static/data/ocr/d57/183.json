This film poses the\nquestion: “How long is the lifetime of a nation?”\nThen it examines the history of these nations: Old\nBabylon, Ancient Egypt, Assyria, Egypt at the be¬\nginning of the Christian era; New Babylon, Phoeni¬\ncia, Persia, Greece, and Rome. The actions and\nconditions leading to the fall of each nation are\nspotlighted. The lessons presented are these: No\nnation which has risen to the pinnacle of world\nleadership has ever stayed there for very long; the\nthree basic causes for the failure of nations are-\npolitical, economic and moral decay. Dr. Ganus\nsuggests that these facts constitute a challenge to\nthe U. S. A.\nRight: Egyptian culture was far advancecf, but ultimately slavery,\nbrought on by political and moral decay, heralded the downfall.\nAbove; in Rome, the downfall was hastened when food and enter¬\ntainment was given to the populace by the government—private\nbusiness ended."
