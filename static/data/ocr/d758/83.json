Schooley\nChairman\nNAEB Publications Committee\nGregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Franks\nMany thanks for the memo concerning a breakfast meeting\nof the Publications Committee at the Convention. This\nis a very good idea, but 1*11 have to beg off due to\ninvolvements at the home office.\nCongratulations on the new format for the Journal. It\nis a fine issue and shows great promise for the future.\nYou asked for suggestions for possible agenda items. I\nwould like to propose the following for your considerations\np\n(r\nM\nâ€¢2-\nInclusion of articles in future issues involving\nprogramed learning and broadcasting - both for\nradio and for television.\nCoverage concerning the possibilities of stereo-FM\nfor educational purposes. It seems to me that the\nuse of the two separate sections on a single channel\nmight open up new avenues of experimentation other\nthan just straight stereo.\nI would like to see reporting of case studies of\nschools and institutions with plans to employ the\n\"case-by-case\" opportunities afforded by the new\nFCC relaxed interpretations.\nShould the NAEB JOURNAL be a more inclusive\npublication with coverage to serve many facets of\nthe field not really treated fully in the past?\nIf so, what should be included?\nWith all good wishes for a successful get-together.\nCordially yours,\nDirector\nBureau of Instructional Materials"
