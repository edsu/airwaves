They\ncharged it with the duty of making a survey to determine\nhow an expanded program of audio-visual — radio communica¬\ntion and kindred facilities can best fit in the North\nCarolina educational system. We would like to impose\non you for a bit of assistance.\nKnowing that Alabama is in the forefront in the use of\nFM radio in the educational field, it has occurred to\nus that you and your agency may have conducted a survey\nto determine the need for this facility in the Alabama\neducational program. It will be deeply appreciated if\nyou will advise us as to whether or not such a survey\nwas made; if so—its procedures and specimen copies of\nany questionnaires that you may have used in making such\na survey.\nWe would also appreciate your advising us as to whether\nor not any survey has been made by an Alabama agency in\nthe field of audio-visual education and if so to whom\nwe could write for information as to how such a survey\nwas conducted.\nIf the occasion should arise, we would be delighted\nto render you any service in connection with the project\nwe are working on.\nCordially yours,\nRobert W. Redwine\nRR:s Administrative Assistant\nSam Lattimore, Chairman • Members: Grady Cole, Mrs. Ethel Perkins Edwards, Dr. John H. Lampe, Richard H. Mason, Hervie N.
