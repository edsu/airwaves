Outright purchase of an existing VHF commercial\nstation* This is bound to be exceedingly and\nperhaps prohibitorily expensive* This could\nprobably be accomplished only in New York or Los\nAngeles, where there are 7 YJIF stations.\n2. Transfer of an existing commercial VHF channel\nto educational use through rule-making proceedings\nbefore the FCC« The difficulties of this course\nof action are obvious bec«.u^e of the inevitable\ndirect oonflict with existing interests.\n3. The addition of VHF channels by way of relocation\nor \"drop-in\" as in Detroit and Rochester. This\nis by far the simplest method, but such\nopportunities are bound to be infrequent.\n4. Time-sharing arrangements on existing VHF\nchannels that are presently utilized commercially.\nThis would require FCC action modifying licenses\nof commercial stations so as to make available time\non channels for part time educational licensees.\nUnder these circumstances, it is our recommendation that\nthe JCKT should now seek a general investigative proceeding\nbefore the FCC under Section 1.10 of the Commission’s Rules.\nThis rule provides that:\nSection 1.10 Proceedings before the Commission. The\nCommission may on its own motion or petition of\nany Interested party bold such proceedings as it\nn0c0fi«*ry from time to time in connection\nwith the investigation of any matter which it has\npower to investigate under the law, or for the\npurpose of obtaining information necessary or\nhelpful in the determination of its policies, the\ncarrying out of its duties, or the formulation or\namendment of its rules and regulations. For such\npurpose it may subpena witnesses and require the\nproduction of evidence. Procedures to be followed\nby the Commission shall, unless specifically\nprescribed in this part, be such as in the opinion\nof the Commission will best serve the purposes of\nsuch proceeding."
