We\nwill be busy, too, in working on the reports of the General Assembly so\nthat every member will receive by air at an early date at least one copy\nof each of the two Volumes of the Proceedings.

There will be many other General Assemblies in the\nyears ahead but those of us who were fortunate enough to go to Taipei will,\nI think, remember most the smiling faces of our hosts, always cheerful\neven when they must have been very tired, and the efficient organisation\nwhich lay behind their gracious hospitality.\nHIGHLIGHTS OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY\nThe Third General Assembly, which met in Taipei from 24th to 31st October,\nwas attended by 62 delegates from 24 member organisations and by five\nobservers representing the United Nations, UNESCO, ECAFE, ITU, FAO\nand COMSAT.
