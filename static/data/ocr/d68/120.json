(See the \"Responsibility Scale\" in this section of\nthe Teacher's Guide.) He knows what these levels are and how they\nare designed to be utilized in the classroom.\nThis teacher understands that he is an integral part of the teacher¬\nlearning situation where television is used as a major resource in his\nown field of study. He is aware that his role can be a rich and re¬\nwarding one, the more so when he, himself, is fully aware of its various\naspects. As he organizes and guides the important classroom activities\nwhich enhance and reinforce the television lesson, this teacher dem¬\nonstrates the variety of his own contributions. He is:\nA FULL PARTNER - MEMBER OF A TEAM\nThe classroom teacher and the television teacher form a\nworking \"partnership of specialties. \" The members of this\nteaching partnership share equally the responsibility for in¬\nstruction, as they move together down the same path toward\nmutually-understood goals. The classroom teacher works\nwith a full knowledge of his partners objectives, direction,\nand method of approach, made available to him in the\nTeacher's Guide.\nA PLANNER\nIn his handling ofa subject in the classroom, the classroom\nteacher largely determines how the televised units will be\nused, just as he decides to a large extent how he will use\nthe textbook and other resources.\nC-3"
