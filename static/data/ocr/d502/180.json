Novik\nSuite 1200\nWest 23rd Street\nNew York 11, New York\nDear Maury:\nHerewith Memphis materials returned.\nThe firm statement by our Board that all requests for help from\nyou should be channeled through me was not my idea. It reflected\nconsiderable concern lest wires get crossed, or that together you and\nwe might be aware of different developments which might affect each other.\nI therefore think you should check with us, or ask that requests\nbe directed (or even checked by phone by the requester) with us before\nyou proceed, as we do pretty much for legal counsel, consultant teams\nand the rest of our services.\nAlso looks as if liaison between Ralph and us isn*t as good as\nit might be. I*11 continue to s end him carbons of everything I think\nis in his bailiwick, and will hope he*11 do the same. So far Nighbert\nhas ignored my earlier note to him on this, of which I sent you a copy,\nI still have hopes, with all the people you know there. I think\nNighbert and Martin might be cautioned not to bristle too much in the\nmeantime, and let you do some groundwork in establishing some underÂ¬\nstandings. Otherwise union stubborness, too, may result locally.\nPart of my other letter of today is also pertinent to this.\nOur best.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJSscb"
