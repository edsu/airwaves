ADKINS, DIRECTOR\nKay 13, 1956\nk\\\nNAEt> HEADQUARTERS\nMai 23 !96o\nDr. Harry Skornia\nNASB Headquarters\n14 Gregory Hall\nl\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI was pleased to read in your Special Notice to Sub¬\nscribers that the Fact Sheet Service is going into its\nsecond year with increased faith in its ability to deliver\nsomething of value. I certainly want to add another voice\nto the chorus of approval that should be reaching you regard¬\ning the Fact Sheet project. It is my view that there is a\nnation-wide need for a research high-lights service; that the\nNAEB was the logical organization to undertake the job; that\nvery useful and commendable work has been done; and. finally,\nthat the project should by all means be continued and further\nimproved.\nOver the months certain thoughts regarding the Ihct\nSheet Service have been bothering me. Perhaps this is a\ngood time to ventilate those ideas. First, why is the\nservice restricted to items of \"Educational Television\nResearch?\" I presume that the original demand was for news\nof research about television. Probably the major proportion\nof current research concerns television rather than radio.\nNevertheless, useful studies in radio research are being\ndone. I think we need not argue the idea that those who\nwork with educational radio want and need research informa¬\ntion almost as much as educational television people do.\nCouldn’t the service be broadened to include coverage of\nradio research (items chosen according to your present\ncriteria)? The line at the top right of the Fact Sheet\nletterhead might be changed to \"Educational Radio-Television\nResearch\" or \"Educational Broadcasting Research\" . This\nchange might even bring in a few new subscribers."
