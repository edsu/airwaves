In this case also, the\nCouncil authorised the Secretary-General to pursue his discussions about\npossible collaboration with the ABU.\nExchange of Information on Books and Periodicals\nThe Council adopted a proposal made by KBS, the host organisation for its\nmeeting, that the Secretariat should collect from members information about\nbooks or periodicals on broadcasting, published in their own countries,\nindicating the language in which they are available.
