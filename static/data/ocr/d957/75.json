Knowing nothing about the\nsituation, he wrote on a personal basis, and said I might use pertinent\ndope, but asked me not to circulate the letter as such. Here goes....\nHe is still chairman of the Radio-TV department at Indiana UniversltyÂ«..*\ndata regarding him are on file with the Bureau of Placement, University\nof Michigan....Walter Roberts in charge of Austrian Public Affairs,\nNew State Building, Department of State, Washington, can provide a\nstatement on Skornia work in Austria... .The President, Dean and others\nat I. U. still insist that they expect Harry baok at Indiana..There\nis a possibility that he might elect to go back to I.U. ...There is a\npossibility he might elect to stay in present or similar work with\nState Department....Any decision probably could not be made until\nNovember, if a decision were required of him....and he probably would be\navailable no earlier than May 15.
