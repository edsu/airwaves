Army activities in TV.\nThe first half is a summary of the research reported in TELEVISION IN ARMY\nTRAINING; EVALUATION OF TELEVISION IN ARMY BASIC TRAINING. (.See NAEB FACT SHEET\nSeries I, No. 7)\nIt is stated that a second phase of the study has been completed and that a\nfinal report is in preparation.\nThe article also states that closed circuit television is being used at Fort\nGordon, the location of the above two studies, to present instruction in electronic\nsubjects, teletype maintenance, and informational programs. A large screen pro¬\njector is reported in operation.\nAt Fort Monmouth, another closed-circuit system is in operation. One impor¬\ntant development there is the use of TV to show films with a minimum of classroom\ndisturbance, increased number of showings, and in a lighted room permitting note¬\ntaking.\nThe article concludes by saying TV will not replace conventional instruction\nor solve all military training problems, but TV will play an important role in the\nArmy’s training methods in the future.\nIrving R. Merrill"
