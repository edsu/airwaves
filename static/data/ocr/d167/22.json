Harold Hill\nMr. James Fellowsv^\nMr. Vernon Bronson\nFROM: Ji« Etheridge jofota&y'/\nSUBJECT: Region II Conference-Planning\nCommittee Meeting\nHalf or more of those listed at the bottom of thij Memo\nhave agreed to try to meet in NAEB offices in Washington at about\n9:30 AM, Monday, November 16, for the purpose of planning all de¬\ntails of the Annual Region II Conference to be held at Williamsburg\nnext March 19-21. 5\nAs I mentioned to some of you in Austin, we will greatly\nappreciate it if you could provide us with a meeting room, prefer¬\nably one with a phone, for a period from about 9:30 AM to near\nmid-afternoon-though I hope we might be able to finish our con¬\nference-planning work before then.\nCertainly we will greatly appreciate it if, in your busy\nwork schedule, it can be arranged for one or more of you good\nnational staffers to be with us for a substantial part of this\nplanning session.\nWith the Region II Treasury containing only about $130\nturned over to me by Gerry Appy, and with the NAEB budget listing\nonly $200 for assistance to all regional conferences, I wonder if\nit might be possible for the Region XI Conference to be held in\nconnection with some NAEB clinic, workshop or conference for which\nsome financial assistance may be available? We will deeply appreciate\nyour consideration of this if it is at all possible. Since the\nRegion II Conference is to be held relatively close to active\nmetropolitan ETV aresa in other regions, it is our hope that we can\nhave considerable inter-regional participation."
