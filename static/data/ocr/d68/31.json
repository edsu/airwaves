In selecting and preparing a television lesson or series of\nlessons for the classroom, what decisions must be made?\nWhat criteria govern these decisions? Ideally, who would\nbe involved in making these decisions? Who is responsible\nfor such decision-making in the school system with which\nyou are most fami liar? Upon what should these decisions be\nbased if the television lessons are to be most effectively\nutilized?\n2. What are some of the limiting factors which may influence\ntelevision lesson preparation? (i.e. correlation with adopted\ntextbooks, other curriculum requirements, limits of lesson\ntime, lesson sequence to be scheduled around special days,\nholidays, standardized tests, etc.)\n3. Why is television production called a \"team effort?\" Who\nare the membersof this team? Why are the television teacher\nand the classroom teacher frequently designated the \"teach¬\ning team? \"\n4. Discuss the place Lesson Guides have in proper utilization\nof instructional television? What kind of information and\nmaterial, if included in a Lesson Guide, would be helpful\nto you as a classroom teacher using television? See the\nnotes at the end of this Section for a sample from the Guide\nto accompany the television lesson used in this film, page D-1Z\n5. Why is it desirable to include classroom teachers in the\nplanning and preparation of television lessons? (i.e. im¬\nproves lesson quality and usefulness; gives the classroom\nteacher a clearer understanding of what television can and\ncannot do and an awareness of the problems involved in pre¬\nparing television lessons.)\nD-8"
