  "text": "2 -\nMR ROBERT UNDERWOOD\nand to think out interesting subjects. As I mentioned earlier X\nhope to follow the rough outlitoe I submitted, but am not sure.\nThere is so much of interest in Japan and in Tokyo that is good\nbut topical and perishable. At any rate, I expect to line up my\ninterviews very soon indeed and will advise you accordingly. Of\ncourse I'll send the finished scripts •\nTwo questions come to mind now. I wonder if there could\nbe any publicity of the right sort attending my series, or the\nlaunching of REPORT FROM JAPAN for actually I so spend a lot of time\non it, and am quite interested in seeing that it succeeds. It is\nthe only program of its kind emanating from Japan now. Did you know\nthis. There is nothing like it 12 Infact, it might be sold commer¬\ncially, or the idea, after I've produced the 12 for NAEB. So, if\nyou'd like some photographs or publicity ideas please advise. In\nColumbus, Ohio in particular where I do an occasional newspaper\npiece, I want to see that WOSU gets a splash with this.\nSecondly, will you send me a list of all the subscriber\nstations. Is it my understanding that there are roughly 50 stations\nin all..... is this correct? And one final item, I may ask you to\nrun off a duplicate of tape No. 2 for me and send it to a friend in\nNew York. Just stand by if you yill, for this is not yet certain.\nCordially yours*"
