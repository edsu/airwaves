Hulsen\nDirector Radio Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York City, New York 10022\nDear Al:\nHere are the copies of the various documents regarding\nNASA and Educational Radio.\nSomewhat to my surprise I did attend the Friday, August 15\nmeeting presided over by Macy. Quayle, Coffey and Roth were also\nthere along qith half a dozen others from Ford, NET, etc#\nThe decision was, as I oaderstand it, to r«$ine the radio\nproposal and to have it ready for submittal at an early date.\nOne document to go forward from NASA during the week of August 18,\nbut it will only mention that the radio proposal is forthcoming.\nOne other factor# Regarding timing. Once NASA okays the\nradio project, 90 days lead time would be requested.\nI am sure you will get reactions and report from your own\nstaff people. My feeling was that the radio proposal was acceptable\nto the group, and it was agreed to move ahead.\nMy own feeling is that I have certain concerns and reservations\nregarding another radio •experiment1 (and frhat word was used liberally\nduring the meeting) which I would like to talk with you about one of\nthese days before too long.\nI hope you find the attached information informative. When you\nhave read it, you will know as much as I about this matter.\nSincerely,\nRAM:kh\nEnel#\nRobert A. Mott"
