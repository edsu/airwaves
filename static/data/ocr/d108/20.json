  "text": "REPORT IN EUROPE\nUSEFUL READING LIST:\nA truly worthwhile feature. John Lerch knows that the serious fol¬\nlower of European affairs will appreciate knowing where he can find\nadditional material relating to subject treated in a broadcast. So,\nJohn Lerch will close his program by advising his listeners to read:\n(1) “Last Reprieve for Europe”, in the October 13 issue of The\nReporter magazine.\n(2) Fall issue of The Virginia Quarterly Review for a revealing\ntreatment of France’s internal paralysis in government.\n(3) The Magazine Section of the Sunday New York Times, for\nAnne O’Hare McCormick’s study of the new spirit of inde¬\npendence in Europe, that is, the psychological rebellion against\nAmerican advice or interference in native, traditional ways of\nbusiness and government.\n(4) The October Atlantic Monthly which carries a 64-page supple¬\nment on India Today.\nIn other words, John Lerch will call attention to whatever is of\nsignificance that bears on what he has mentioned in one of his pro¬\ngrams. In closing the program, Mr. Lerch will briefly preview what’s\ncoming: where he will be and with whom he expects to talk next\nweek.\nOF COURSE, THIS IS A '\nSERIOUS PROGRAM:\nTherefore, John Lerch expects to build a reading habit with his\naudience in order to expand and further their understanding of world\nevents. Further, he recommends the map habit. That means taking\nout an atlas or current map and looking at it while he discusses the\ncritical areas of Europe where he now is, or where he will travel next\nweek. Most Americans really like a little geography now and then."
