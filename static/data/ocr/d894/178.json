May I hand the committee a list\nof our active and associate members?\nOf the 23 AM stations, only 4 operate unlimited time, and the remainder, 19,\noperate daytime only, or on a share-time basis, according to records of the\nFederal Communications Commission* The committee may already be aware through\nits senatorial representation is the several States of the unique and special\nservices provided by NAEB stations., In New York City, for instance, NAEB Station\nWNIC, owned by the city of New York, serves that metropolis with weather service.\nUnited Nations information, and other programs nowhere else available* NAEB\nStation W0I, owned by Iowa State College is shown by independent commercial survey\nto have a regular listening audience of mm, than 185,000 families, not individuals*\nfor its farm and home service* NAEB Station KQAC, licensed to Oregon State College,\nwas preferred over all other stations for Oregon rural listening*\nI have personal knowledge and experience with respect to several of these\nstations, having been in their employ at Corvallis, Drag*; St* Paul, Minn,? and\nColumbus, Ohio, but naturally my most intimate knowledge stems from W0I in’Ames,\nIowa, where I have been longest, and of which I am now director*"
