MPATI also produced\nmanuals, supplementary texts, and syllabuses to\nhelp schools receiving the airborne courses. Teach¬\ners and officials of schools volunteering to use the\ntelecasts attended workshops at nineteen colleges\nand universities. A separate summer-long work¬\nshop was held at Purdue University for the air¬\nborne-television teachers. They then dispersed to\nsix ETY stations to begin recording their courses.\nMost of them will devote a full school year to\npreparing 128 half-hour lessons. Because each\nlesson may reach hundreds of thousands of stu¬\ndents, the teachers have the aid of curriculum\nspecialists, research assistants, artists, and other\nresources that not even the most affluent school\nsystem could normally afford.\nThe project’s eventual expansion to broadcasting\nover six channels, for a total of seventy-two half\nhours a day, may come through the use of “nar¬\nrow-band” telecasting, a new method whereby\nbroadcasts occupy only three megacycles in the\ntelevision band instead of six, thus doubling the\nnumber of telecasts possible in the same wave¬\nlength. Courses scheduled for the first year of air¬\nborne telecasting on the school level include Span¬\nish, French, social studies, arithmetic for gifted\nchildren, art, music, literature and composition,\nhistory, geography, and science; on the college\nlevel, chemistry, mathematics, and Russian.\nOn the basis of weather studies, experts estimate\nthat the airborne system will be able to operate\nmore than 95 per cent of the time."
