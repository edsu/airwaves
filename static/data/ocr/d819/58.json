In view of the\nfact that items 1, 2 and 7 are, therefore, yours and since Graydon had to\ntake on a number of items which were not actually incurred by him, we\nthought it would be all right to leave items 3 through 6 as they already\nstand on your bill, confident that you would be able to handle them in\none way or another on your travel expense voucher.\nYou left me $i|.5,00 in cash and I paid $3lulb leaving a balance\nof $10,86, which is covered by the personal check enclosed,\nI am sending this to you by registered mail so that you will\nbe certain to receive the receipt.\nIf there are any errors here do not hesitate to bring them to\nmy attention.\nWith best regards until we meet again - which I suppose will\nbe very soon in view of our several up coming meetings.\nYeips sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nManager of KUOM\nBP/arp\n1 Qf-1 FOUNDED IN THE FAITH THAT MEN ARE ENNOBLED BY UNDERSTANDING â€¢ DEDICATED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF\nlODl LEARNING AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH * DEVOTED TO THE INSTRUCTION OF YOUTH AND THE WELFARE OF THE STATE\n1951"
