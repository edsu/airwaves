For example , the rise of\n-rk-»\nthe steam press increased the role of the newspaper to JJjhe\npoint where it could help pay for better roads and faster\npostal services. The speed at which information moves,\nwhether in theancient or modern vvorld, is the key to\nthe problems and patterns of government and decision-\nSince we are surrounded by new media that are altering\nall of our decision-making problems, the ordinary student\nis in a position to observe and to inquire around the\ncommunity concerning the precise nature of the changes\nbeing effected by the new media.\nBut the artist is always the herald of such effects\nin society. So the student scrutinizes the arts anew wha\nwhen set on such a quest. To lear^jn the effect of the\nWest on Japan, India, China the student need go no further\nthan changes in the arts of these countries. For here\nthe most intimate course/) f change in human sensibility\nand imagination can be discerned years before such changes\nare felt in exterior institutions.\nYfJt /tMe-Ur1] tfyj- v^C-L-t- s C\n£ J.v <rf ^ f"
