The two-week average was 36.7 per cent; sports\nnews had 4*3 per cent of the domestic-hour time. The January 4-10, 1953, New York\ndomestic-hour sports average was 0.2 per cent. Drama had 32.8 per cent of the New\nYork domestic-hour program time, but the BBC figure was 7.5 per cent, representing\na single feature-length .American movie shown during the second week. Eleven and\nsix-tenths per cent of the BBC domestic-hour scheduled program time was devoted to\nrepeats of newsreel programs. News occupied 7.5 per cent of domestic-hour New York\ntime. Domestic information claimed 13.5 per cent of domestic-hour time on the BBC,\n12.7 per cent of this time on New York TV.
