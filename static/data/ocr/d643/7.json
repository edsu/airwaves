Ford-Faust.\nWhen in New York on Monday, saw Dr. Clarence Faust, Ford VP.\nLe came out of meeting to see me because he knew I had only the one\nday In New York and wanted to have chance to talk with me. He has\ninvited me to come back and talk to him later. Now for whatever\nvalue you think my opinions or guesses are worth, 1*11 list some.\nThey are my opinions and impressions, not exactly on anything\nspecific Dr. Faust may have said.\n— He really wants to know about NAEB.\n— He *d heard kind words about me through the FAE - Fletcher\nand Griffiths.\n— He has read little if anything within Foundation about NAEB.\nHe1s been too busy handling two Jobs - the VP and TFAE jobs.\n— He was essentially the listener.\n— He has not prematurely closed his mind, or formed his\nopinion on anything we might ask of Foundation through him.\n— He seemed reasonably pleased, in an Informal way, about\nwhat NAEB had been doing on and with Ford funds.\n— He agreed that he should know more about NAEB. I suggested,\nand he agreed, that he might profit if we furnished dope to him, 1,\nsuccintly written over-all, and 2, some more lengthy things he could\nglance at or read at leisure.\n— consider request to use funds of this year for that\nTV management-financial seminar-workshop that executive (if I recall\ncorrectly) committee and professionally advancement committee suggest\nwe have. Original around here was in neighborhood of |4500. In"
