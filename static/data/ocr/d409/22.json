Hanson,\nincludes fourteen science programs of our mn LETfS FXWD OUT radio series,\ndistributed by the Division of University Extension, Boston, Massachusetts.\nThese are listed on pages 65-66#\ny\nThese programs represent a series done by the St# Louis Board of Education\nradio station KSiH# Through the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters Tape Network, these programs have been made available to\nits member stations, including, as you probably know, your own *HA# These\nhave been released for distribution through no other source#\nAn essential part of this series Is the teacher*s handbook, giving in¬\nformation about the preparation nece sary for each program# We regard\nsuch instructions as the note at the top of page 65 as inadequate and\nsuperficial#\n0\nKelsey Sweatt is using these programs without our permission because he\nhas never contacted us# For hi* to list them In a national publication\nas available fro® his Division with the inference that they originated\nthere is hard for us to understand. In addition, it is our flra belief\nthat the LF?f.-» FTW0 DDT ser5.es cannot be used successfully vithout the\nhandbook which was written to accompany it#\nYW# know that neither you. «i»s Hanson, nor the Educators Progress Servics,\nwero aware of the situation regarding this LST*S ?TiD GOT Hating# *•\nfool that it is important that a correction be inserted immediately In\nall catalogs of this edition, withdrawing the series, and that all\npurchasers prior to this time be notified of the change. W# are, of\ncourse, writinr Kelsey $«eatt#\nMy concern, Walt, goes beyond the thing that has happens*! in terms of\nthe s&s-listing of L£T*S FIND OUT# I do not want, nor do you, to have\nthe chairman of the BAVI tape recordings committee, through his enthusiasm\nand over-eagerness distribute any unauthorised tapes whatever the source#\nTape recordings are much too i»ortant in the whole audio-visual field\nto be issued too fast for the oarefal planning and selection that they\ndeserve#\nSincerely yours.\nair\nELIZABETH GOLTSmiAM, Directsr\nDivision of Audio-Visual Education"
