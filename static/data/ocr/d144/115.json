Apparently, Ms schedule was too tight for\nhim to came by, so I'll now write.\nMU Harley, Jim Fellows and I have discussed this project and think\nthe idea has merit and that Lee has proposed a simple my to proceed.\nHowever, we have a couple of major reservations.\nFirst, we wonder whether the use of the information would justify the\nexpense In printing the nice little booklet that would be required to\nget the information out. Our thought is that it would not receive very\nwidespread use, because those most interested In speakers (HA, school\nboards, service clubs. Aims, etc.) ©re normally in a position to merely\npick up the $ione and call a friend In the business or one who knows\nsomeone who is.\nSecond, we are a little leery of giving the Impression that we are\nendorsing those whose names appear in the booklet. fhis might be\nespecially bad, if, as we fair, the ones wanting their names listed\ntend to be actually the least qualified.\nfhls doesnft close the door, obviously, but we did mat you to knew our\nreactions.\nCordially,\nHarold Z. Hill\nHEH/smj\nccs Mr. Lee Campion"
