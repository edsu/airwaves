EAST LANSING\nTELEVISION STATION • Wit At-TV\n•Dear Harry:\nBefore shoeing off on an out-of-town trip, this Is my recommen¬\ndation in response to your Inquiry concerning the NAEB purchase\nof \"NCS #2.\"\nI recon?r^nd that the NAEB buy the service and that it be made\navailable to the stations according to the schedule of charges\nwhich the NAFB Board may wish to make for use of the material.\nIf there is opposition to paying additional funds for such a\nservice, the Board should consider making the purchase out of\nits current funds and distributing relevant state reports at no\n®*tra cost to stations requesting them.\nThe first decision is whether or not to buy. The second decision\nis whether or not to make it pay for itself through a system of\ncharges for use. Perhaps the second decision would have to be\nmade first; but at any rate, 1 recommend it as a valuable service\nfor NAFU members who have a sincere interest in ary kind of\naudience study and evaluation of their program acceptance and\neffectiveness.\nSincerely,\n(X . A\nArmand L. Hunter\nDirector\nALH/im\nJanuary 15, 1953\nMr. Harry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nlli Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois"
