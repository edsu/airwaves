You should hear directly\nfrom him.\nYou are perfectly correct about the necessity of turning\nout an authoritative list of member stations, associate members,\netc. All of us have been running into all sorts of difficulties,\nbecause there is an apparent discrepancy between Mr. Griffith’s\nlist, Paulu’s list, and information which is available from the\nF.C.C. and the BROADCASTING YEARBOOK.\nI hope to return the material on the brochure to you within\nthe next few days. I realize I am holding up the works, but I\nwant to be sure that the material is everything it should be.\nYou are doing a swell job in working toward an over-all\nmembership campaign. I hope that we will have a report at the\nMay 1 meeting in Columbus.\nWith all best wishes, I am\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES SITS SaS\nDALLAS W.
