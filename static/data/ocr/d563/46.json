  "text": "Base\nThe Learning Lens: II\nin the historic decision were organ¬\nized into the Joint Committee (later\nCouncil) on Educational Television.\nThe Committee was established\nwith funds from the Ford Founda¬\ntion.\nSince then, several streams have\nconverged into the mainstream of\neducational-television develop¬\nment:\nOne was the mass production of\ntelevision sets and growth of the\nmedium as a magnet for the eye\nand mind of the American public.\nAnother was awakening interest\nin adult education. Bursts of\nknowledge in science, international\naffairs, and other fields were mak¬\ning many adults painfully aware of\ngaps in their education.\nAlso, a crisis in the system of\nformal education had developed\naround the postwar population\nboom, exploding knowledge, rising\n10\nten statements from 838 colleges, universities,\nschool systems, and public-service agencies.\nWinning the channels was just the beginning. To\nbe preserved, they had to be used. Use involved\nthe establishment and operation of a station, with\nthese ingredients: money, program content, and\ncommunity support. The Joint Council gave legal\ncounsel and engineering advice to agencies and\ncommunities working to activate educational\nchannels. Then, as now, lawyers for the Council\nentered briefs in EC.C. proceedings affecting\nETV, including defense against efforts to change\neducational channel allocations to commercial use.\nThe first ETV station, KUHT, Houston, Texas,\nwent on the air May 12,1953. In 1954, eight new\nstations were born; in 1955, eight more. Today,\nthere are fifty-four.\nLike its commercial counterpart, ETV needs the\ncostly hardware of modern electronic communi¬\ncation: transmitters, towers and antennas, stu¬\ndios, video recorders, cameras, lights. The Ford\nFoundation, through grants from the Fund for\nAdult Education, gave thirty-three of the first\nETV stations $4.5 million for construction ex¬\npenses. The grants in many cases meant the dif¬\nference between whether a station would come to\nlife or not. The sum has since been matched several\ntimes over by contributions from universities,\nschool systems, foundations, state systems of high¬\ner education, community groups, corporate and\nprivate gifts, and public fund drives."
