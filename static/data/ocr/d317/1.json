Conference program coord¬\ninator.\nEDITOR'S .NOTE\nAt the Region III workshop, particular emphasis was placed on the\nproblems and questions of the individual delegates. Consequently, the\nattached report contains many sections devoted to Questions and Answers.\nWe feel this is one way to reflect the spirit of inquiry which ran brisk¬\nly through all sessions.\nIt should be clearly understood that virtually all questions and\nanswers, as well as the talks and comments of the major speakers have\nbeen paraphrased. Although the individual is often identified, it is\nwell to remember that there may be errors of content or emphasis. We\ntrust that such errors have been held to a minimum, but should they\nexist the fault lies with the questionable stenographic ability of the\neditor. Much as we should like to have you believe otherwise, we a re\nnot infallible.\nFollowing the pattern of Schenken's excellent report on the Region\nII meeting, we have opened this write-up with a summary of the major\nrecommendations arrived at during the conference. We further acknow¬\nledge, with appreciation, the aid of the various state-group secretar¬\nies who provided coverage on the sub-regional meetings on the 23rd, and\nthe valuable aid of Bill Stegath who covered the unexpected session on\nthe night of the 23rd.\nWilliam Bender, Jr.\nRecorder"
