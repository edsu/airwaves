Specialized teachers would\nreach more pupils with each teaching experience, reducing the number of re-\npeats. The cumbersome method of distributing audio-visual films could be\nrevolutionized by an electronic distribution system that would save the time\nof the classroom teacher and give that teacher a greater opportunity to use\nthe film at the most appropriate time in the lesson plan.\nIn order to accomplish this reduction in time and expense and increased\nefficiency and effectiveness, County School superintendents should be per¬\nmitted to use both open and closed circuit television, including the use of\nlow-power transmitters, micro-wave facilities, videotape recording and play¬\nback equipment, translator (or relay) transmitters, and other television\nreceiving and transmitting equipment that may be required.\n3. Procedures shall be established whereby public schools can be reimbursed\nfor the costs of presenting courses on television that are used by enrolled\nstudents for home study, or for other viewing where it is not feasible for\na certified teacher to be present.\nPresent practices require the physical presence of a certified teacher with\nthe student if that student is to be counted for purposes of apportioning\ncertain funds to school districts. Research and experimentation into teach¬\ning and learning methods are pointing the way to a more widespread use of\nself-teaching (through home study, individual teaching machines, etc.) in\nwhich the physical presence of a teacher is not necessary. The use of\ntelevision is an important factor in these new developments."
