During Shapey's tenure as conductor and director (1964-1993), the ensemble dedicated itself to the performance of compositions by the University of Chicago's doctoral candidates in composition, as well as newer or unknown composers who had not yet achieved national or international attention. Consequently, many of the composers whose works were performed by Contemporary Chamber Players went on to become prominent figures in the world of contemporary art music. Contemporary Chamber Players premiered works by composers such as Mario Davidovsky, George Perle, Shulamit Ran, George Rochberg, Roger Sessions and Ralph Shapey. Contemporary Chamber Players benefitted greatly from funding from the Fromm Music Foundation, founded by Chicagoan Paul Fromm (1906-1987). The ensemble held an annual concert in his honor, featuring compositions by well-known contemporary art music composers. The ensemble also toured the United States, playing venues such as the Library of Congress and Carnegie Hall, as well as numerous colleges and universities. Locally, Contemporary Chamber Players worked closely with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during the tenure of music director Jean Martinon (1963-1968). After Ralph Shapey stepped down as Contemporary Chamber Players's director in 1993, the group was led by several resident conductors until Shulamit Ran, a faculty member and former Shapey student, became artistic director in 2002. The ensemble continues performing new art music in Chicago under the name Contempo.<\/p>\n            <citation xmlns=\"urn:isbn:1-931666-33-4\">From the description of University of Chicago Contemporary Chamber Players records, 1958-1996 (inclusive).
