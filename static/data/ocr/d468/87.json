That this belief constituted the\nbasis of all testimony In a court of Justice; and that he -knew of\nno cause in a Christian country where a witness had been permitted\nto testify without such belief.n\nThus you nay see, gentlemen, the doctrine that wo hold so dear, of\nthe separation of Church and State; does not mean that we must\nseparate godly conduct from practical life* On the contrary, it\nmeans, if anything, that we Americans Judge all our actions, public\nand private, from the point of view of religious morality; that we\nhave always done so; and that I trust we shall always continue to\ndo so*\nrdWu-T NOISSSy\nThat was o. very remarkable evening, To cane villa*\nVery remarkable* 1 am beginning to feel that in religion, as in\nso many other things, we are learning in America that, it is not\nwhat a man believes that matters so much in plo conduct; but the use.\nhe makes of his beliefs* I speak, you understand* from a purely\npractical point of view*\nOf course. X must admit before X left France X thought that\nAmerica was peopled with philosophic infidels; and that Foinn was\nthe most we could hope for. X must say also, that I am surprised\nto find religion on the sido of freedom*"
