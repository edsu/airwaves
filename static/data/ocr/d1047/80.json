Harley\n600 North Park\nMadison 6, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nYour very kind note of December 29 and your Christmas card added to the\ncheer of the season.\nI am remiss in not having written you a note long ago expressing my great\nadmiration for the work you have done during the past two years as President\nof the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, especially since,\nas you say, I was responsible in part for getting you in that job. Your\nwork prior to becoming president and my genuine belief in your strengh\nand intelligence as an educational broadcaster convinced me that you were\nthe best man in the organization for the job. I have never had any reason\nto question my initial opinion.\nI know you leave the job with a great sense of relief, some misgiving, and\nsome doubts; however, in my opinion, you have provided truly outstanding\nleadership and should have a great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.\nIt was a real pleasure working with you on the Board.\nMy warmest and kindest regards.\nGA: sb\nP. S. Please give Mac my congratulations at having you back on the staff\nfull time.\nPrograms Broadcast on Alabama Educational Television stations\nWBlQ, Channel 10; WTIQ, Channel 7; WAIQ, Channel 2\nmember National Association of Educational Broadcasters"
