Theresa ^venue\nSt. Louis# Missouri\nDear Marguerite Fleming:\nI an in a very apologetic mood since I had esqoected to\nbe able to send you something tangible or at least audible a long\nwhile ago. But# work has really piled up around me in a most de¬\nvastating fashion. Finally however# I have gotten to the point\nwhere I had been able to produce the first two and what I would\nlike to have as a series of programs on ’’This is a Friendly World\".\nI am sending you a tape with these two programs,\ntentative of course# and hope you may finu time to listen to them\nand give me your suggestions.\nI have been establishing# more slowly than I had\nanticipated, contacts with United Nations people and the people\nof the various embassies in 'Washington# looking toward more of\nthis type of material and the kind of thing I discussed with you\nand other members of your committee. Our budget is expanding\na little now and we have more help so that I am hopeful of being\nable to give you a larger service and hope to be able to meet\nyour needs.\nI do appreciate so very much your encouragement and\nyour kind words.\nSincerely,\nN\nEdwin Randall\nERtcc"
