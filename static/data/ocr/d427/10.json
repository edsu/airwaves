Letters #9 and 10, which\narrived here this morning, will be released with Issue 6*\nThis will result, for a time at least, in a certain amount of pile-up,\neven of possibly dated Material, at the stations. I suggest, therefores\n1) That Hovoy record a certain minimum (perhaps 25f) of completely\nundated material*\n2) That he unequivocally categorize and mark every program either \"staple\"\nor \"dated\".\n3) That Network inform the stations as early as possible to which catagory\neach program belongs. .\nThe stations may then by-pars the staple material in favor of the dated,\nholding the foraer until a later date.\nBest regards.\nJHtdo\noc?
