Harley\nYes\nHe is now president-elect of the NAEB\nMost enthusiastic about both Mr. Harley and his proposed project. See note to\nabove candidate.\nOscar L. Press\nIII Would also rate B instead of A\nYes ~ —\nLess well qualified than several others listed here. Also I feel\nthere might also be some personal problems of adjustment.\nGene P. Halboth\nNo. Has never contacted us with his suggestion, to my knowledge.\nI wish his project gave less evidence of being drafted in a hurry. It\ncould stand considerable further analysis and pre-planning. Much of what he\nnow proposes could be done in the U. S. from discs and tapes which are avail¬\nable here. It is unfortunate that at least some of his supporting letters\nare not from academic sources."
