  "text": "-40-\ndirector of the NBC's Central Division, a pioneer in educational broadcasting\nand long-time friend of the NAEB and educational radio and television in general\n■We feel that the growing member-base of the NAEB is an indication of\nsound growth, which is attributable largely to the increased service provided\nto members, as outlined under MEMBER SERVICES earlier in this report. It is\nalso due to the *‘proprietary\" interest which members have in an association\nwhere officers, policies and services are determined by the members themselves\ngiving them a real voice for educational broadcasting in both radio and televi¬\nsion.\nCONCLUSION\nIn its efforts to serve not only its own membership, but also the broader\ncause of educational uses of radio and television in the United States, we be¬\nlieve the NAEB has made many worthwhile contributions.\nMany of the most important of these achievements would have been\nimpossible without the confidence and generous support of the several Founda¬\ntions and Funds, whose understanding is herewith most sincerely acknowledged\nThanks to this progress, which has sometimes been undramatic but fortunately\nhas been continuous for many years, American education is far better prepared\nto meet many of its new problems than it otherwise would be.\nHarry J. sflcomia\nExecutive Director\nJune 28, 1957\nHJS:jrl"
