C.\nDear Bill:\nThank you for your letter of July 30 in which you discuss the\nAETC application for more space in the spectrum for microwave\nuse.\nIn the light of your up-coming vacation in the latter part of\nAugust and the possibility of a NAEB representation to the\noffice of John Bystrom in the HEW, may I suggest that an\nearly date be set for the same. This is based on the possibi¬\nlity that we will have such a meeting.\nIn discussing the matter with Dick Hull over the telephone,\nhe was in agreement with me that, if the TV Board could not\nfunction in this capacity, maybe the Executive Committee\ncould do so.\nIf we are to have this meeting, I would suggest that it be at\nthe earliest possible date, sometime before August 15.\nWith kindest'personal regards, I am\nRDH/ml\nSincerely yours,\nThe Nation’s first ETV network telecasts simultaneously over four channels. Programming is originated by Auburn University, the Bir¬\nmingham Area Educational Television Association, the University of Alabama (which is also a NET affiliate), and CBS-TV and NBC-\nTV documentary programs and educational telecourses."
