C.\n9 August, 1950\nMr. G-raydon Ausmus,\nUniversity of Alabama,\nBox 2002, University, Alabama.\nDear Mr. Ausmus,\nGeorge G-lasheen lias told me of the pleasant chat with you\nrecently. By now, you probably have noted that NBC, break¬\ning all precedent, is to rebroadcast the \"Quick and Dead\"\nseries sometime this fall.\nI understand Siegal at WNYC is negotiating for use of the\ntape and a project also is brewing to purchase 50 pressings\nof the series for use by schools.\nHere is a suggestion re a speaker for the October convention:\nThe Director of Public and Technical Information of the ABC\nis a pioneer in the use of broadcasting by government agen¬\ncies. He is Morse Salisbury. Comment from talks Morse has\ngiven recently to educational extension groups has been highu\nly favorable.\nHe is talcing a deserved vacation just now but will be back\nby the time you get this. I expect to attend the conven¬\ntion myself and enjoyed meeting many HAEB members at their\nluncheon at Columbus, Ohio last May.\nMeanwhile, if you have any specific ideas for programming\nin the atomic energy field, this office will try to help\nyou.\nSincerely yours.\nCharter Heslep, chief,\nRadio Television Section,\nCC: Glasheen,"
