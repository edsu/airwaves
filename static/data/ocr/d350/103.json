Rishworth\n1500 Portland Avenue\nSt. Paul 5, Minnesota\nDear Tom:\nI hasten to acknowledge your letter of September 27th\nwhich I received almost as soon as I stepped off the\nboat from a trip abroad.\nDuring the past month a special committee of NAEB\nhas been canvasing the field, and I believe that a\nselection has already benn made. I know that when\nI left, your name was up for consideration, but since\nI don't have any concrete knowledge of the discussions\nof the committee, I cannot tell you whether you are\nstill being considered, or if for some reason or other\nsomeone else \"got the nod\".\nThere is to be a meeting of the committee on October\n16th in Washington, and you may rest assured I will\npresent your letter and your resume. I know that\nAllen Miller has, on many occasions, suggested your\npossible availability.\nCordially,\nSeymour N. Siegel\nPresident\nsns/t"
