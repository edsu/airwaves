  "text": "June 11,1962\nMr. John C. Crabbe\nGeneral Manager\nCentral California Educational Television, Inc.\nP.O. Box 6\nSacramento 1, California\nDear John:\nNaturally, I am very disturbed by your letter—particularly sine© you\npropose talcing an action on what appears to me to be partial or even\nfalse information.\nLoren’s memo was misleading in suggesting that the Board arbitrarily\noverrode the TV members. The full Board did not accept the proposal of\nthe TV Board for experimental production of TV programs for a two year\nperiod, with referral to the ETV stations for approval. Instead, it substituted\na motion calling for a test run of just two production projects and specifically\nindicated that this motion did not contemplate the setting up of any regular\nsystem of distribution or production.\nIn this revised motion—considerably more restrictive than the original—\nthe majority of the TV members voted along with the other members of the\nfull Board.\nIn other words, though there were questions as to the utility, feasibility,\nappropriateness etc., it was felt that a test production of just two series\nwould certainly not constitute NAEB entry into TV production and that the\nEvidence thus derived would be worthwhile in making a future policy decision\nin this matter when much more information was available as basis for judgment.\nUnder these circumstances, the majority of members—including three of the\nfive TV members—felt that a poll was unnecessary before making such a\npreliminary step. Even Gunn, who was on© of the two who voted against the\nmotion, has since changed his position. In a letter to me he says, **I share\nmany of the doubts and concerns of Loren Stone on this matter, but think that\nthe only way to prove the value of such a service to the NAEB and to the\nmembers may be to set up a trial run and see how it goes"
