But many dif¬\nferences appear within each main division. Colleges\nand Universities with 10 watts operation operate from\n10 to 70 hours per week. The second wide variation\nappears with Colleges and Universities with greater\npower, from 10-147 hours per week. This figure includes\nthose hours broadcast by the New York City system. But\neven in the third and fourth divisions there is a great\nvariation.\nAverage Number\nof Hours\nPer Week\nRange of Hours\n1. Colleges and Universities\n10 Watts\n34\n10-70\n2, Colleges and Universities\n250-5,000 watts, AM and/\nor FM\n58\n10-147\n3* Public Schools and Boards\nof Education\n21\n4-52:30\n4„ Other Institutions\n40\n30-57\nHours Per Week of Broadcasting\nProvided 'to Commercial Btations\nVery few hours of educational broadcasting are pro¬\nvided to' commercial stations. Although this is subjec¬\ntive, it might be considered a healthy trend in some in¬\nstances. If one agrees that it is not the job of com¬\nmercial stations to handle the problem of educational\nprogramming, that if educators are going to make some¬\nthing worth-while out of their part of this dual-system\nof broadcasting, then certainly the time and effort devot¬\ned to producing programs for non-educational stations is\none which might well have a negative growth effect."
