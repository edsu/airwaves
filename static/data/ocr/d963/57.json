Hawing no\nassociation cf their own to turn to, these several thousand educators turned\nto the NAEB. Because we believed that educational standards should remain\nindivisible, and because we believed that their need was genuine, we wished\nto be responsive to it.\nAt the annual UAEB Convention, in October of 1950, the membership\napproved revision of the HAEB Constitution to make associate montoership statue\navailable to closed-circuit television installations of bona fide educational\nnature.\nAlthough this considerably dislocates, once again, the balance between\nincome and expense (since income generally follows service rather than the\nreverse), and tenporsrlly retards progress towards self-support, we believe\nthat in the long run both American education and NAEB interests will be served\nby the common ©ffbrfce which this pooling of resources will make possible.\nIt is in this rapidly expanding area that the greatest pressure is now\nbeing exerted on the NASD for guidance, assistance aid leadership. We have\na considerable reserve of experience and knowledge which we Shall distribute\nto our utmost. However, if emerging principles are to be valid, our efforts\nmust continue to involve, as consultants, and contributors, educationally\nresponsible individuals, from whatever source« curriculum specialists,\nteacter-treining si^ervisore, psychologists, social scientists, research\nscholars, administrators, and otters. Only if the services, seminars and\nmaterials we offer are of uncompromising integrity and quality, hammered out\non educationally valid and cfcjecttve bases, can the instmrrents in whose use\nwe are specialists, be considered to be responsibly used to help American\neducation wet its needs in a manner which will command respect aid pride."
