About all I heard was what\nI read, so can't fill you in much. I think everyone thought I knew about\nit. Apparently this is fruition of meetings you earlier attended.\nIt might ease the pressure on the in-school area which is still, as Henderson\nwill tell you, a headache, and let us go on to more general worlds to\nconquer. I'm now working on the NAEB and its FM stations, and Hi-Fi\npossibilities. Any ideas for sources of funds ($50,000.00 or so)?\nRegards,\nHJSjjy\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
