For this reason no station x\nx should attempt to use this series unless the handbook is made available to x\nx the teachers at least two weeks in advance of the programs. x\nx x\nx The materials to be used by the children in their classrooms are easily x\nx available in school or may be brought from home by the children. x\nx x\nx During the actual production of this series, a group of children was in the x\nstudio. In some of the programs their voices are quite audible, in others x\nx we have purposely not allowed them to be heard. When the studio children x\nx are heard, attention is called to their answers so that the listeners in the x\nx classrooms will not respond. *\nx x\nx This series is planned for the season of the fall semester. x\nx x\nx Station KSLH will be anxious to receive your comments on this series of pro- x\nx grams. x\nx x\nx *\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X -X- X X X X -X- X X X X X X -X- X X -X* X X"
