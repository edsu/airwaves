The present budget is\nset up on the assumption that television tech¬\nniques and kinescope recordings would be used.\n11. We will use one writer to prepare the treatments\nand preliminary scripts and make ever/ effort to\nuse one production agency for all kits.\n12. Use a well known authority on the program to\nlend continuity and to give the kits prestige.\n(No suggestion as to who this would be.)\nKIT OUTLINES\nKIT NO. 1 - EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING\nThis kit will trace the history of educational broadcasting from the early days of radio to the\npresent day uses of television. It will show the action of Government to protect the interests of\neducation through the reservation of FM channels and television channels for noncommercial\neducational use,- and their current status.\nOutline by: Jim Fellows and Gertrude Broderick\nThe purpose of this kit is to establish the use of\ntelevision as part of the continuing effort by educators\nto improve the teaching - learning process. Television,\nalthough a relatively new technology in the school\ninstructional program, is another in the long line of\nefforts to improve the educational program. It is\nunique in that like many of its antecedents it is an\naid to the teacher and the learner, but at the scsne\ntime if is also appropriately used as a basic method of\ninstruction. Its use and acceptance requires that we re¬\nthink and re-evaluate many of our educational traditions -\nnot that they are necessarily wrong, but that with an\nopen and flexible approach some habits which are not\nlonger effective can in time be replaced by new and\nmore useful patterns."
