I intended to talk with Harry during his recent\nvisit to the Twin Cities, but so much was happening I didn’t\neven get around to calling him on the phone.\nI finally had a call from Seth Spalding of the U.S. Office\nof Education. I think the call came because of Gertrude's per¬\nsistency. He wanted to know what progress had been made on the\nutilization kits and wanted a revised time table and budget for\nthe project. I sent this off to him and a carbon copy to Harry.\nA blind copy for you is enclosed with this letter. Dr. Spalding\nhad several questions about our project. One of the first dealt\nwith the use of the Advisory Committee. He was extremely reluc¬\ntant to go in on a budget that called for a full Committee\nmeeting in San Francisco. At Gertrude's suggestion we explained\nthat this was not just a committee meeting but a special group\nto screen these proposals. This he tentatively bought and I\nbelieve will go along with having a meeting of a selected group\nin San Francisco on the 16th and 17th of October. This may\ncause a small bit of dissension on the part of some of the\nUtilization Committee members but if the U.S. Office is going\nto limit us to a specific number of people, then we have to\nmake some kind of selection to be sure we get the people we\nwant.\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nAUG 1 2 1960\nAM p ^\n‘7l?l?|iP|l,l|l?| J|2|8|4|6|?\nI\nIn regard to the money that NAEB has put into the project,\nyou have a record of the various expenses to date and I propose\nthe following break-down for spending the remaining amount.\nFirst, I will use some to take care of phone calls and other\ncommunications in setting up the preliminary steps for the project."
