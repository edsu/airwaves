Use a thermometer to determine boiling and freezing points of water.\n3. Keep a daily record of thermometer readings and changes in weather.\nSources:\n1. Parker - ’’Thermometers, Heat, and Cold”\n2. Parker - ”Ask the Weatherman”\n3. Carroll - Understanding cur World\n4. Carroll - Understanding the Universe\nProgram No. 3\nTORRICELLI\nThings to Remember:\n1. Air exerts pressure.\n2. Air pressure changes slightly from day to day.\n3. A barometer measures air pressure.\nAir is a substance which occupies space and exerts pressure. At sea level the\naverage pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch. A barometer, an instrument\ninvented by Torricelli, measures the pressure of the atmosphere. Changes in\natmospheric pressure accompany or go before changes in weather. A rapidly falling\nbarometer often indicates an approaching storm; a rising barometer may indicate\nfair weather. Winds are caused by the flowing of air from regions of' high pressure\nto regions of low pressure.\nThings to Do:\n1. Use a tumbler of water and a piece of paper, inverted, to show that air exerts\npressure in holding the paper against the glass.\n2. Keep a record of daily barometer readings and note weather changes that\nfollow pressure changes.\nSources:\n1. Parker - ”Ask the Weatherman”\n2. Fletcher - Earth Science\n3.
