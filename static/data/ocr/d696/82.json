  "text": "PERSONALIZED PUBLIC RELATIONS\nBY\nMarion E. Corwell\nPublic relations has been defined as \"merely human\ndecency... which flows from a good heart... genuine and\nsturdy enough to be reflected in deeds that are admirable\nand praiseworthy. \"\nTo most of us, the term, \"public relations, M is\nthought of as a professional service! a planned campaign\nor program to be executed by a paid staff. Since World\nWar II, the necessity of a well-defined blue print for pub¬\nlic relations has been increasingly recognised by manage¬\nment of profit and non-profit organisations alike.\nThe importance of the major tool of the public rel¬\nations expert -- publicity -- cannot be minimised. A sta¬\ntion may be convinced its broadcast offerings are the best\nin its market, but if its potential audience is not induced to\nlisten or watch, the effort for quality programming is lost.\nThe advice of KNME’s Thomas Petry in the March-April,\nI960, NAEB Journal is excellent: \"Better the product--\nthen advertise!\""
