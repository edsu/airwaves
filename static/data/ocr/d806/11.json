The\ndinner was delightful and I always enjoy seeing your youngsters\nand ’’the Mrs.**.\nWhen you and Wilbur have worked out what you consider\nthe best arrangement for you in relation to the takeover, please\nlet me know. I had rather clear the details of it with the\nBoard than for you to do so.\nRide herd on the plans Jim is making for the TV train¬\ning program and for the seminar. I hope he will clear all\ntentative plans with you and with Wilbur and then with me before\nhe releases any statements broadside to the Board. I do not\nwant us to rock the boat too much in these early stages of the .\nformation of the Center.\nKeep me posted on reactions - let me know when you\nfeel that I am headed in the wrong direction or need some new\ndirection.\nMy kindest regards.\nCLul_"
