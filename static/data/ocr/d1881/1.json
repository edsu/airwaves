The Panel has been charged by Congress to bring in recom¬\nmendations for revision of the 1909 Copyright law. Speaking for the educational groups,\nRosenfield proposed that \"recognized non-profit educational institutions\" be allowed\n\"where no commercial advertising is included nor other private financial gain is involved\"^\nto make one copy of a copyrighted work for educational purposes.
