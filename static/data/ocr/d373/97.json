Radio\nand television are as much a part of the daily,\nlife-experiences of the poor as they are of other\nsocio-economic sectors of our society. According\nto recent figures, 95% of American homes have\ntelevision sets.\nWhat may be unique here is that the \"settings\" in\nwhich these experiences will occur will, probably,\nbe markedly different from the normal educational\nenvironments. Involvement, we envision, will be\nmore profound, because we shall engage whole family\ngroups, whole leadership groups (CAA Staff - Educa¬\ntional - Government) in those experiences. What\nwe hope will emerge from such efforts will be\nstronger, more clearly definable community develop¬\nmental growth patterns.\nThrough the mass communications media, we can make\nalmost every \"poverty ghetto\" resident, an active\nparticipant in the process of social and individual\nreconstruction.\nWhy use mass communications media? The best answer"
