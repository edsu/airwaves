X lias ten to say\nthat tills won't keep us from trying occasionally when wo are strongly moved\nbut to know the relative odds would be a help.\nX strongly commend to the Board's attention consideration of some plan whereby\nthe NAKB when there is a subject or problem of a timely nature deal with it in\nth© sarao way that national commercial networks do. It seems to me that we will\nmiss future opportunities which may occur more frequently than we expect, unless\nw© do prepare ourselves for an important, minute-man type of service when the\nneed is great. Radio can do a job that television, so far as wo are concerned,\nis not likely to be able to do as well or certainly as swiftly and at as little\ncost.\nSince I cannot be at Columbus I am writing this too extensive memorandum.\nSome day we will emerge out of New England again when the next building phase\nhas been completed. Right now w© are still in there fighting for NAEB."
