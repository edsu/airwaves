Like you, I sometimes feel discouraged\nover this.\nWhat can we do about it? Well, we can continue to do\ngood work, we can bring it to the attention of as many people\nas possible, and then we must philosophically hope that we\nwill be rewarded in the next world for what we donft get in\nthis!\nWith best personal regards.\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBPtds\ncci Harry Skornia\nFrank Schooley"
