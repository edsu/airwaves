  "text": "I’m No Fool\nThe Nature of Things\n“This is You”\n\"MICKEY MOUSE CLUB\"\nHIGHLIGHTS\nJiminy Cricket, who was rather proud of his work as Pinocchio’s conscience,\nplays an active part in several portions of the MICKEY MOUSE CLUB. In this\nseries he plays the leading role in five new units dealing with\ndifferent aspects of safety.\nEach unit is in full animation and utilizes humor and a catchy song with varying\nlyrics to fit the situation. Subjects covered are\n(a) Bicycle Safety, (b) Fire Safety, (c) Pedes¬\ntrian Safety, (d) Water Safety, and (e) Safety\nduring Recreation.\nAs the title of the series (also the title for the\nsong) implies, Jiminy believes it’s smart not\nto be foolish.\nIn this series Jiminy Cricket again assumes a major role, this time somewhat\nas a moderator or master of ceremonies, as he discusses and sings about a number\nof things which interest him. Specifically, he is fascinated with the “case histories”\nof some of our most popular animal friends.\nWith animation, real photography and a special song he delves into the background,\nthe characteristics and the special qualities of\nthe Horse, the Beaver, the Elephant, the Giraffe\nand the Camel. He>,shares with his audience\nthe realization that many of the things associated\nwith these animals which appear strange are\nreally just “THE NATURE OF THINGS.”\nOur friend, the Cricket, in this series turns to\na subject close to every viewer—“YOU.” Jiminy\nfinds a discussion of the human body and how\nit works to be not only a rich source for his\nparticular brand of humor, but a subject full\nof never-ending marvels.\nHe limits himself in this series to spotlighting\nthe five senses of man and the relative degrees\nto which each has been developed. The first\nunit is introductory to the series titled “The\nHuman Animal. This is followed by one on “The Five Senses.” Successively,\neach of the senses is dealt with."
