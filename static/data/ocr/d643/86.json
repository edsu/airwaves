Schooley\nWILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nI got back from my three weeks vacation with the\ninevitable mountain of mail to answer, and I*m just finishing\nit up now as I get ready to go to Washington for a weekTs\ntelevision seminar arranged by DAVI of NEA.\nI am sorry that you have had to spend some time in bed.\nI hope this letter finds you your usual lively self.\nI note with interest and approval the hard work that\nyou have put in on the St. Louis convention. I am taking\nwith me a bit of NAEB correspondence and material which I\nshall read on route. I am planning to confer with Dick\nHull in Columbus on my way to Washington, and in Washington\nwith Gertrude Broderick, Lennie Marks, and any others who\nhave things to do in connection with NAEB. This may lead to\na few telephone calls to Harry.\nI had a perfectly marvelous vacation with the family,\ndriving to Oregon and back. We went out via the Badlands,\nBlack Hills, Bighorns, Yellowstone Park and the Grand\nTetons. We returned via Glacier, and spent six of the seven\nnights on the return trip tenting. This proved a somewhat\nstrenuous but extremely enjoyable and relaxing vacation--\nthe first real one I*ve had since 1952. I hope that you and\nyour gang did somewhere as well.\nWith best personal regards.\nYours sincerely,\nBP:ds\nBurton Paulu\nPresident"
