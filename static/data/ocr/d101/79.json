Formal presentations are asked\nto be limited to from ten to fifteen minutes except for Session\nVI, in which case eight to ten minute presentations are expected\nbecause of the larger number of reports to be presented*\nAny materials which can be distributed in advance will be partic¬\nularly welcomed, and the copies of the remarks left for publication\nmay be somewhat longer than the oral presentation, and may include\ngraphic or tabular materials not conveniently presented at the\nConference itself. Slide projectors will be available.\nNo central hotel reservations have been made for this conference\nand participants are urged to request needed accommodations\ndirectly as soon as possible.\nUnder terms of the contract, the NAEB is prepared to reimburse\nspeakers for travel and hotel expenses incurred.\nHJS/dp\nJuly 10, 1959"
