One\nsuggestion, if Colby is to be editor, indicate\nhe is ex-officio member by virture of office.\nThat would tend to take a little sting out.\nOf suggested names, I know best Harry\nSkomia and Ben Press, if any new names to be\nadded. I would not add Hartford Gunn at this\ntime, I don’t know Ted Conant well enough at\nthis time, and I can’t place Dave Bell,\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley.\nDirector of Broadcasting\nWILL\nFES:mll"
