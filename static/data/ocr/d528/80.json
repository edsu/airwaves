POWELL, JR.\nPresident\n19 June 1969\nMr. Robert Mott\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\n1346 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Mr. Mott:\nSeveral months ago, I submitted to the Corporation for Public\nBroadcasting a proposal for a new program of radio production\nrelated to higher education and community development.\nIn advising that CPB would not fund this project, Mr. Donald\nQuayle suggested that I contact you to see if we might pursue any\nof the programming suggestions with NER.\nUnfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to follow this\nsuggestion up until recently, having been out of this office\nduring April and quite busy since that time.\nI have enclosed the proposal which was submitted to CPB, and\nhope you will have the opportunity to look it over. It does, I\nthink, have a number of ideas which NSA and NER might work on as\njoint projects.\nI would appreciate hearing your ideas on this, and will be\ncontacting your office next week to see if an appointment can\nbe arranged for such a discussion.\nRespectfully,\nSteven A.
