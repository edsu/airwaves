KENTON, JR.\nADVERTISING DIRECTOR\nSeptember 18, 1952\nMr. Frank Schooley, Treasurer,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\nUniversity of Illinois,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nDear Mr. Schooley:\nI have just read your advertisement for\n**The Jeffersonian Heritage** in the September 8th\nissue of Broadcasting and believe it is a message\nthat would interest the readers of Printers* Ink.\nIn our audience of 24>000 people inter¬\nested in advertising are the advertising, manage¬\nment, sales and agency executives who are the ones\nwho select media and programs. Many of them are\nprospects for the series of half hour radio dramas\nwhich you are now presenting.\nWe have recently published a special re¬\nport on National Spot Radio. In the report we listed\nmany of the ways that radio advertising can be ef¬\nfectively used to sell merchandise. These appeals\nare of course adaptable to a program like **The\nJeffersonian Heritage**.\nA full page in Printers* Ink at present\nrates costs $520. A wire from you will reserve a\npage in the next available issue.\nIf you*d like any further information about\nPrinters* Ink, please let me know.\nCordially,\nREK:MF"
