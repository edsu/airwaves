I probably would have read the news in the\nNew York Times, if you hadn’t reached me at the airport*\nThank you for sending me a little biographical material about\nyourself* This will help in any public relations program*\nThis is the day before general elections here in New York, so\nI do not want to go into too much detail ?rith you about the big job we\nhave ahead of us during this coming year* I would like like the dickens\nto have you concentrate on membership, especially the associate variety*\nI would like to see a thousand new associate members before the time the\nnext annual meeting comes up. If you would ride herd on the regional\ndirectors, and do a bang-up recruiting job, we could increase the\ncirculation of the ’’News-Letter,” and really build a little strength\nin the organization*\nI think I have convinced both Probst and Hudson that each\ndefray the expenses of a Board of Directors meeting, so that we can have\nat least four meetings during the year*\nI know you are going to do a big bang-up job on the New Orleans\nconvention, and I am personally delighted with the decision, because I\nwould rather go south than anywhere else*\nI will be in further touch with you, and plan to keep you fully\ninformed of any ideas concerning the expansion of/NAEB*\nAs ever.\nWith all best wishes, I am"
