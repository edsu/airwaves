BOX 2787\nJanuary 16, 1952\nMr* Oraydon Ausreua, Director\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nUniversity of Alabama\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Oraydon*\nFor the last several years the National University Extension Associa¬\ntion has had a national Committee on Implications of Atomic Energy.\nThis Committee has enjcyed a very close working relationship with the\nAtomic Energy Commission and a large part of the educational interests\nof the Atomic Energy Commission have consequently had expression through\nthe NUEA.\nThe most spectacular project which has been developed up to date has\nbeen the mobile Atomic Energy Exhibit which was constructed at a cost\nof about 1100,000. This Exhibit will be shown this year in some seven\nor eight states and will be seen by about 2,000,000 people. It is\nalready scheduled for approximately three years.\nIt happens that I m Chairman of this Committee during the current\nyear and we have been considering the possibilities for expanding our\nwork into new areas. Up to the present time there has been no organ¬\nised large-scale activity for interpreting the implications of atomic\nenergy through the medium of radio. I am wondering if the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters would be interested in exploring\nthsse possibilities with us.\nI should appreciate your calling this matter to the attention of the\nproper officials of the NAEB and letting m have their reactions as\nsoon as convenient. If this group should prove to be interested in\nlooking over these possibilities, please request the president of the\nNAE3 to appoint one or more appropriate people to meet with our NUEA\nCommittee at a suitable time*\nVery sincerely youra,\nJ. R. Morton, Director\nContinuation Education\nJRMtse"
