Wright\nDirector of Broadcasting\nThe University of Tennessee\nBox 8450, University Station\nKnoxville, Tennessee\nDear Ken:\nSorry you can*t make committee meeting. Think these\nitem® need consideration, and if you have any ideas about *em\nyou might fire away ahead of meeting time:\n1. How can we operate effectively (working at same\ntime network acceptance committee works), i.e., how can we be\nsure a good series developed at our suggestion will get used,\nif network acceptance committee can always stop? This isn*t\nnew question, and for any good ideas we might have, I*m not\nafraid of getting them used, but it Is an awkward position for\nus.\n2. What program areas, if any, does network really\nneed? Do we have series suggestions that can be mad© to extend\nto proposal for subject matter, type, lengths, and approximate\ncoot. Here, have in mind one or two series that we might need,\nand for which Center might be willing to commission production.\nI have in mind the idea that we should do this, not idea on\nseries. Do you?\n3. How about working out program series idea with\nMult Education Association, say in field of gerontology. My\nidea, which I^e discussed informally with AEA rep, is that\nwe*11 plan series from beginning, for radio, and for study use\nof AEA groups. In preparation and production, AEA angles for\nstudy groups will be planned and worked into the series as we\ngo, not after as was done in cases of Mankind and Jeffersonian.\nI think that has good possibilities myself.\nThere may be other things, but you might wish to\ncomment on above, or take off from.here.\nWill see you In New York.\nWith kind regards,\nSincerely,\nFES/blc\nFrank E. Schooley"
