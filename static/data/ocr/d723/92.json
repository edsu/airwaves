The\nNetwork distributes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape\nrecording, weekly, to members suscribing to its service. This fee Is\nalso based on power (with the same power classifications as membership)\nand a new station does not have to pay the full fee until the third year\nit is in the Network. The fees arei\n$400.00\n250.00\n150.00\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\n375.00\n225.00\n300.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and\nfrom Network Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A\nstation paying its full third-year rate is paying only a little over\n$2.00 an hour for better than 400 hours of programming from the Network\nin a year. This Is about the most inexpensive programming a station\ncan do.\nIf, after looking over the materials witch we shall send you, you have\nfurther questions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEH/ok"
