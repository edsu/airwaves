NEW YORK\nSeptember 6, 1962\nMr* Harold Hill\nVice President, HASB\n13l'6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D»C.\nDear Harolds\n.. „ * was> needless to say, happy for the opportunity to discus©\nthe StH with you and look forward to a close association as we try to\ndevelop the network. I have followed up our discussion with Jim Robertson\nas well as the program directors of the interconnected stations. They\nwere all basically in agreement with the ideas w© developed regarding\nprogram acquisition and/or exchange between ERH and WAEB,\nThe most feasible plan is the suggestion you made of purchasing\nindividual programs or series by this office for us® on the network* As \"\na beginning let m suggest the followingj\n1. The SRN would acquire program (or series) from the WAEB at the\nrat® of ’115 per hour or fraction.\n2* These programs would be broadcast by ERN member stations simul¬\ntaneously or by tap® delay not later than seven (?) days after network\norigination*\n3* The ERW affiliates will maintain active memberships in the MAEB.\n!i. Any programing offered by NAEB and not available on the JEW\nschedule could be acquired by the individual station at the present rat®\nof $Ii per hour or fraction.\nservices rendered, by an individual station, e.g. ;«U, to\nHAEB could be continued in lieu of active membership dues and additional\nprogram services not carried by ERW.\n6* WM programs offered to and selected by WAEB would fe® exchanged\nTor WAEB programs on a quid pro quo basis*\n1 think I have covered most of the pertinent points keeping in\nmind that there are some special arrangements existing between individual\niiRH affiliates and the WAEB. The above procedure allows for these differ¬\nences. The only other point which needs to be worked out is in regard."
