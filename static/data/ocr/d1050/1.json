The real objective of the\nstation (profit or education) should be the determining factor.\nIt was moved by Schooley (WILL) that the Executive Committee\nstudy the matter and make a formal recommendation as to what shall\nconstitute the basis of membership qualification.\nIII. NAEB Clear-Channel hearing representation. Moved, seconded and passed that\nMarcus Cohn (1420 New York Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C.) be authorized to\nspeak in behalf of NAEB at the hearings.\nPresident Hull asked to be excused so he might catch a train to Washington,\nHe appointed Ex-President Engel to preside at the meeting.\nIV.
