WOI-FM • WOI-TV\nNovember 21, 19^1\nMr. Graydon Ausmus\nWUOA\nUniversity of Alabama\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Graydon:\nIt doesn't seem possible that it is weeks since we met in\nBiloxi. Being aware of the fact that it was that long ago makes me\nrealize how much NAEB business has piled up on my desk since my\nreturn!\nOne of the big things, of course, is getting out a December\nNews-Letter which will deal mainly with the convention. In order\nto do this I ought to have certain types of information and material:\ncomplete data as to how many people registered; how many stations,\nstates and countries were represented, and other data of that sort;\nthe texts of the principal addresses, if available; information as to\nwhen the talks given will be available to the tape network; and any¬\nthing else that would contribute to a rather thorough report of the\nconvention.\nIn due course I will transmit the official thanks of the organi¬\nzation for all you did in preparing this meeting. For now let me say\ninformally that you really gave us a first rate meeting: I take my\nhat off to you for a superb job l\nSincerely yours.\nBurton Paulu\nSupervisor\nFund for Adult Education\nTelevision Project\nBP:sb\ncc/Richard L.
