While this may not be classed\ndefinitely as a format, it is a particular type of program offering,\nand would give opportunity for expression to indicate how interested the\nvarious stations are in this service of NAEB.\nIn Section II, Item 5, I think I understand that you are asking whether\nprograms should be grouped by packages for selection, or should be of¬\nfered for choice on the individual series. I think this series selec¬\ntion is jhmportant. For example, KSLH and WABE should surely be able to\nselect a series in lieu of the series they are supplying the network.\nIn Section II, Item 6, does the »»Individual program” method of mailing\nmean that the station would receive each program of each series in an\nindividual mailing? It seems to me that this would mean a tremendous\nincrease in postage cost. Perhaps there are other reasons for this\nindividual mailing of which I am not aware.\nThe survey questionnaire is quite inclusive, so I can’t think of other\nthings needed, and these items I have mentioned may not be too important.\nWill look forward to seeing you in Columbus two weeks from today."
