  "text": "NEW ACCESSIBILITY FOR SERVICING\nThe top-plate is pivoted to give access to motors, brakes and all elec¬\ntrical connections. The control panel lifts up and locks in position,\nexposing electronic components, control switches and connections.\nSimilarly, the internal assemblies slide out for checking, servicing and\nreplacement of tubes. Plug-in type connections are used throughout1.\nNEW RELIABILITY\nFor foolproof tape handling qualities, the Ampex 350 has a three\nmotor tape transport mechanism. Mechanical refinements have been\nmade, based on Ampex’s experience with recorders that have been\nsubjected to thousands of hours of accelerated usage.\nMODEL 350 TAPE REPRODUCER\nProvides playback functions only —\nfor pre-recorded tapes, program\ntranscriptions and editing. Since the\nunit has no erase and record heads,\nimportant tapes are protected from\naccidental erasure.\nTHE AMPEX STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE\nIn addition to its new features, the Model 350\nincorporates these basic characteristics that\nhave put Ampex Tape Recorders in a class by\nthemselves.\nADHERENCE TO SPECIFICATIONS\nAll published specifications (given in full on\nthe back page) are conservative ratings, not\nexaggerated claims. Before it leaves the\nfactory, each Ampex Model 350 is instrument-\ntested to equal or exceed every performance\nfigure.\n15,000 CYCLE/SEC. RESPONSE AT 7'/2 IN/SEC.\nAmpex machines meet NARTB primary stand¬\nards at a tape speed of 71/2 in/sec. as well as\nat 15 in/sec. Substantial tape economy can be\nachieved without perceptible sacrifice of\nquality.\nFREEDOM FROM NOISE AND DISTORTION\nSignal-to-noise ratio of single track Model 350\nrecorders is over 60 db by NARTB standards.\nFlutter and wow are well under 0.2% rms at\n15 in/sec. and under 0.25 % rms at 7 V2 in/sec.\nEven on successive re-recording of Ampex\ntapes, build up of noise is negligible.\nACCURACY OF TIMING\nTiming is accurate within ±3.6 seconds in 30\nminutes program time. Timing accuracy is a\n“built-in feature’’— not a precarious balance\nof adjustments. Tapes can be interchanged\nfrom one Ampex to another without affecting\ntiming of the recorded material.\nFAST RESPONSE TO CONTROLS\nStarting time is “instantaneous\" — full stable\ntape speed in less than 1/10th second. In\nstopping, the tape moves less than 2 inches\neven at 15 in/sec. tape speed. Exact cueing\nis routine on an Ampex.\nLOW OPERATING COST\nBecause an Ampex Recorder is built to give\nthousands of hours of reliable service, it saves\non maintenance and outlasts a succession of\nlower quality machines. An Ampex costs less\nper hour, per month and per year—reason\nenough to buy the best.\nIF YOU PLAN FOR TOMORROW, BUY AN AMPEX TODAY\n3"
