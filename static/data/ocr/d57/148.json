She went into an entirely new realm, and became, at\nthe start of the series, the first woman passenger to go faster than the speed\nof sound--830 miles an hour--in a jet plane.\nShe did this to have an authoritative flying experience in order to give frame\nto all of the broadcasts she planned to show how women with the most to gain\nfrom a strong and protective air power position in this country were often caus¬\ning it most of its troubles because of ignorance and fear. She recognized in her\nseries that the taxpayers annually lose as much as $2,000,000,000 from fail¬\nures of people in the Air Force to stay in, which meant tremendous new train¬\ning costs for replacements; that mothers often had great fears of jet flying for\ntheir sons; that some women did not want to marry men in the Air Force, ask¬\ning them to get out first, because it did not seem like a good place to raise a\nfamily with all the moving about, and even to parental concern of losing the\nmoral influence of the home,\nDel Vina did 26 shows, one a week, literally took the women of her audience\nby the hand and analyzed each of these disturbing factors, and demolished them.\nFrom the national headquarters of the U, S. Air Force recruiting service,\nshe received this testimonial:\n\"At the time your broadcasts started, in your listening territory, we were\nfailing to meet our quotas by as much as 50%. At the end of three months, in\nthe same area, we were beating the quotas by 10%. We attribute this largely to\nthe acceptance of the ideas broached by you. \"\nFrom General Nathan F, Twining, newly appointed chairman of the United\nStates Joint Chiefs of Staff, came another letter:"
