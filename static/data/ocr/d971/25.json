The audiences for each open circuit installation\nwere found to be increasing; the programs were said to be improving in\nquality and school administrators were largely in favor of the success of\nthe programs.\nA shortage of television sets still remains an important obstacle to\ngreater television utilization. School administrators appeared to be willing\nto adjust school bell schedules to accommodate good television programs.\nDriver education programs in both cities did not obtain expected viewers.\nAn increase in recording of better prepared programs was recommended.\nThe committee will attempt to have reports of those research studies\nand ones conducted at Syracuse and Brockport reported at the November\nResearch and Communications Convocation being organized by the State\nEducation Department in cooperation with State research, audio-visual, radio\nand television organizations.\nLarry Myers reported on a study he has underway to determine desirable\ntraits to be found in television teachers.
