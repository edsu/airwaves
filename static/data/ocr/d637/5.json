  "text": "Section II, Item 5\nOne sentence is confusing, to wit: MFor example, one proposal is\nthat we offer one new series each week\". Does this mean, as I interpret\nit, that every week of the year, stations would get an additional new\nseries??????separate series being offered in succeeding weeks????\nSection III, Item 1\nYou are so far overlooking School of the Air operations like ours,\nwhich are planned on a basis of the full school year, i.e., September\ntill June. So, this question should be revised to include something\nlike: \"If you plan your in-school programs on the baas of a full school\nyear, during what period do you plan for the year ahead?\""
