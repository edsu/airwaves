ALABAMA\nJune 15# 1962\nMrs. Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nN.A.E.B.\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Betty:\nThank you for your letter of June 13th\nindicating that Harold Hill has forwarded our\nresume of the Region II annual meeting to your\noffice.\nUnfortunately, this is the third year we\nhave assembled this material \"fruitlessly\". I\nknow this has not been your fault.\nIf you can advise who it is in Region III\nwho sends you copies of speeches delivered at its\nconferences, I shall write to him to inquire how\nthese are pried from the hands of the speakers in\nadvance. My attempts to secure advance Region II\nspeaker's copies have been futile.\nThe first year that I sent you material it\nwas based on my running from meeting-to-meeting\nto make notes on what was being said. In those\nmeetings which I did not visit I had assigned a\n\"reporter\". It was the waiting for the summaries\nfrom these reporters that delayed sending in this\nmaterial the first year. The second year, this\noffice wrote to each speaker listed on the program\nbefore and after the conference for a copy of their\nspeech. None sent copies prior to the conference.\nSixty percent sent either a copy, rough notes or a\nsummary; some of those were two months in arriving.\nThis year we were fortunate to be in a building\nwhich had microphones and audio tape facilities in\neach speaker's room. These recorded tapes arrived\nin our office two weeks after the conference. My\nsecretary used my tape recorder when time permitted\nto copy the more \"general interest\" speeches; of\ncourse, this took quite some time...and, she had an\nautomobile accident in the middle of the transcribing."
