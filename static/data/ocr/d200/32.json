Hull, Director\nRadio and TV Broadcasting\nOhio State University\n215 West 19th Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio\nDear Dick:\nI hope sometime in the very near future you will have the\nopportunity to read over my comments at Airlie House so I can\nhave your reactions and suggestions. I have just re-read the\nmaterial myself, and feel that it’s about what I would like to\nsay for the larger group at Philadelphia. Obviously it would\nneed to be adapted for the convention, because the original\nwas prepared especially for the Seminar; however, it embraces\nmost of my current thinking about the Association’s future and\nwith some polishing and omission of certain sections, seems\ntome to provide the basic content for the presidential address.\nI would like your frank appraisal and suggestions. I\ndon’t hold that the President must necessarily express the\nviews of the majority of the Board in addressing the conven¬\ntion; nevertheless, I would prefer to be in general accord with\nthe Board’s attitude.\nIt was good to see you getting about again, even if it was\non three legs I\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:jh"
