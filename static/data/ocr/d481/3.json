Edwin Browne\nDirector, KPKU\nEES Building\nUniversity of Kansas\nLawrence, Kansas\nDear Ed:\nI believe the enclosed memo to the Board is self-explanatory. I have\nalso enclosed the original document which is to be signed by you and\nreturned to me for presentation to the bank.\nI have asked the Board to send each of us a copy of the signed resolution.\nSince time is very important (i don't want to be in the position of having\nno bank account upon which checks my be drawn for the Associationâ€™s\nGeneral Fund), I would appreciate it if you would execute the statement\nfor the bank as soon as you have a total of nine signed resolutions man\nBoard members - tliat win constitute a majority of the total membership\nof 16 on the Board. I am hopeful that you will be able to return this\nto me by January 8, but that will depend on how prompt all of the Board\nmembers are.\nShanks for your help. 1*11 affix the HAEB seal after you have returned\nthe signed document for the bank.\nRegards,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEEiabt"
