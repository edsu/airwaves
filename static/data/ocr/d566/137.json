  "text": "for optimism. He also checked on the Brush head, an item for\nwhich Toogood ostensibly has been waiting. The sales manager\nof the company said they would not be in production before\nJune, which can readily be interpreted to mean several months\nlater. Therefor, hope in Toogood*s machine gets less and less\nas time goes on. Before we make a firm move I would suggest\ncontacting Mr. T once more—if no answer is forthcoming then\nsomething else is called for.\nIt seems to me there are threepossibilities which present\nthemselves as alternative solutions:\na. Find some one else to build a duplicator.\nb. Build it ourselves.\nc. Buy a string of stock recorders.\nI don’t know who would undertake the job of building a\nmachine for us, or whether anyone would for a price we could\npay. I feel reasonably certain that if the right people from\nhere could be partially relieved of their other duties for a\nlittle time, that we could build the machine ourselves. It\nis possible that we could get some help from Toogood. We would\nget considerable help from 3M. It seems to me a real possibility.\nIf we decide on stock machines I recommend we not use Magnecords.\nThe care required in keeping three of them running like anything\nin time together is fantastic.\nIt soon will be the first of the year. There will be some\ntime between the decision and the operation of the equipment.\nI therefore feel that it is essential to make a decision on this\nas soon as possible. We have been waiting since June. Before\nwe appear before the foundation let’s have something underway."
