We\ndid not settle on a specified number of people in each salary bracket, but we do\nhave in the contract, as you know, a sliding XXXX salary scale based on experience,\nand -the top salary figure is appreciably below the minimum in town. ,\nWe have had no contact with AFRA, and I am not initiating any contacts unless\nyou have any thoughts to the contrary.\nHow close are you to the AFM situation? Has anything been done about this on\nan educational television level? I should like to get your thoughts about this.\nSincerely,\nRichard J. Goggin\nGeneral Manager"
