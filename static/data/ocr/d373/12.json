Although most of the programs were pro¬\nduced as \"live\" specials utilizing the EEN inter¬\nconnection and featured timely subjects and per¬\nsonalities, we have managed to extend the distri¬\nbution of one program, TALKING BLACK, through\nnational distribution with ETS-Program Service.\nI am enclosing a transcript on the TALKING\nBLACK program and the EEN press release on the\nother programs which were about and for the dis¬\nadvantaged.\nI hope this information will serve your purpose\nfor background on EEN programming to and about the\ndisadvantaged. Please keep in mind that many\nEEN affiliates produce programs on their own in\nthis category and I am sure they will report their\nactivities to you separately.\n575 Technology Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139\nTel. 617-491-0045"
