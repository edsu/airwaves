Starr Road\nColumbus 21, Ohio\nDear Dick:\nHow to get within NAIB activities this promotion of UHF\nseems difficult to me. Should we plan a joint campaign\nwith NBTRC? Should we publish Robert E. Lee’s letter?\nIf so, would Putnam give his permission? (If so, please\nreturn it. The ditto won’t photo.) And, if so, would\nyou, perhaps, write an introductory statement for it?\nOur stuff hits only our members. We need also to con¬\ntact other groups (as through JCET) on this. Glad to\ndo what we can. But our channels aren’t proper for a\nbig push by us.\nBill gave me this Thursday in Washington. It is returned\nherewith.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nPresident\nHJS: jp\nEnelosure\nCC: ,/Mr. William Harley"
