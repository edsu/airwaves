That's less than ten cents. With tempura (fried fish)\nit goes to 100 yen a bowl...or 30 cents. Soba is also sold\nby street vendors....\nThe boys on bicycles are kind of good humor men' At night\nthey have a special whistle to announce their wares!\nUdon (a wheat flour macaroni) also came originally from China,\nbut some 500 years after soba was introduced. Both soba\nand udon served either hot or cold are important daily foods\nin Japan.\nI understand the number of Soba restaurants in Tokyo, for\nexample, is estimated at close to 3,000. And that over a\nmillion and a half soba or udon dishes are eaten daily in\nTokyo. Well, tell us about this buckwheat Tokugen.\nBuckwheat grows in Siberia, North Germany, Holland, other\nparts of Europe and in China and Japan. Japan's annual\nproduction reaches approximately 3 million bushels. To make\na soba dish, we generally mix buckwheat flour and wheat\nflour on a 50-50 basis. If you see a Soba restaurant with\nthe sign KIS0BA it means that pure or 99 per cent soba is\nserved.\nFor the calorie conscious, this could be a problem.\nNo, not really. For it contains many vitamins. Soba does\nrate higher than rice in calories...something like 350\ncalories per bowl of soba. Moreover, soba is a food rich\nin albumen...good for high blood pressure.\nOne of the interesting sights in Japan is the soba boy\ndelivering as many as 30 bowls of soba while riding his\nbicycle at full speed.\n-4-"
