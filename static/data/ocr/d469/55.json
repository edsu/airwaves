Are there\nrelevant feasibility studies, surveys, research projects, audience reactions,\nor other similar types of information to support your statements of need?\nWhat program resources are available locally and to what extent will they be\nused? Is local live production of programs, (based on local sources,)\nrealistically required? To what extent can (or cannot) program services be\nprovided by other stations in the area? To what extent will membership in\nnetworks or program exchange arrangements contribute to total programming?\nWhere interconnection for program exchanges is involved, what are the kinds\nand hours of program benefit to be derived from such interconnection?\nWhat arrangements have been made for proposed or continuing participation and\ncooperation of major educational organizations or community groups in the\nsupport, program development, and/or utilization of station program service?\nWhat is the relative priority of your project among identified needs for\neducational broadcasting facilities within your State?"
