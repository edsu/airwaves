They are putting up posters, saying that\nthis teamwork demonstrates what can be accomplished if the unions will only\nstick together. It's propaganda for what you might call a Popular Front on\nthe labor union level to go along with the Communist-Left Socialist bids\nfor a Popular Front on the strictly political level*\nThere is no sure way to measure this, but some observers are con¬\nvinced that Pastore's CISL has lost ground in recent weeks and months. They\ncite as factors in such losses three things * the Christian Democratic\nparty's losses in the national elections last June; the dilemma in which\nPastor© found himself in the recent strike of workers against the Christian\nDemocratic government! and, finally, the attacks that have been made on him\nfor teaming up with the Communists*\nIn summary, the effort by Italian democrats to bring about de¬\nfections from Communist leadership on both the political and labor union\nlevel seem at the moment to be making little progress. There is some\nevidence that the defections, in fact, are going in the other direction.\nGraham Hovey, signing another radio Letter from Italy. This\nprogram was recorded in the Home studios of Radio I tall ana for the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters — and this is the NAEB Network.\nm"
