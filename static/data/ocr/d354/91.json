It was generally agreed that these audi¬\ntion sessions were most valuable, and should be extended in future Seminars.\nFriday, June 11th, found the Seminar meeting as a whole again for the pur¬\npose of discussing the problems and particular techniques of several educational\nformats. Much of the emphasis on Wednesday and Thursday had gone to the dramatic\nprogram, so Friday1s sessions were devoted to the following formats: (Where com¬\nments seemed particularly valuable, they are summarized below.)\nA) Adaptations\nB) Classroom Participation Programs, with particular emphasis on the Msingle\nvoice\" or \"master teacher\" type of program. In this connection, the Semi¬\nnar heard and discussed a tape recording of \"Let’s Find Out,\" the popu¬\nlar elementary science program produced at KSLH and currently on the NAEB\nTape Network. Mrs. Gertrude Hoffsten, who writes and presents this pro¬\ngram, had the following suggestions to offer:\n1) Check with a sampling of classrooms on the specific needs and teaching\ntechniques of the grade level you have in mind.\n2) Provide accurate handbooks, listing the equipment which will be needed\nand stating where it should be when the broadcast starts. Also, desig¬\nnate the location of the student experimenters. (Two are used in'Let’s\nFind Out.\") Will the broadcaster tell them to stand, or are they to\nbe standing at a table at the front of the room when the broadcast\nbegins?\n3) If the writer of the program is not to broadcast it himself, the mate¬\nrial should be written for the personality of the person who does\nbroadcast it.\nU) Use children in the studio, and take your timing for experiments from\nthem — allowing just a little more than they need. Of course, check\nthe experiments with children of the appropriate grade level before\nyou ever come into the studio."
