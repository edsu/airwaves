I appreciate your sending me the\nmaterials about ETV programming for minority groups. We\nhave been getting a remarkably interesting set of reactions\nto the series. I have asked Marc Tucker to share these\nwith you. There will also be a more systematic evaluation\nreport available in the fall.\nI have left EDC and am now on temporary assignment at Yale\nUniversity, but I expect to take a continuing interest in\neducational television, both instructional and community\nbroadcasting.\nSincerely,\nArthur L. Singer, Jr|"
