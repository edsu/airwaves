C.\nOctober 17, 1961\nMr. Frank Schooley, Director\nUniversity Broadcasting\n227 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nFrom some of the statements of others which you included in your\nmemo to the Publications committee, plus miscellaneous letters re¬\nceived by me, McKenzie, and others, it is apparent that there are\ntwo misconceptions about Educational Radio-Television. I thought\nyou might like to know about them so that the points can be clarified at\nthe time of your committee meeting here in Uhshington.\nFirst - the magazine is not intended to replace the Journal, but apparent¬\nly many people got this impression. And, of course, at this time there\ncan be no firm plans for adding this publication to our existing publica¬\ntions program until we can figure out some way to finance it during the\ninterim before it can become self-supporting through ads and subscriptions.\nTherefore, the future is currently in doubt. Perhaps your committee will\nhave some ideas along this line.\nSecond, the letter from Ampex was handled like an ad. They had it printed\nthemselves and paid to have it inserted into the magazine. Therefore, I\ncan see no harm in the procedure. True, if we had inserted the letter\ngratis, then we would have been in an embarrassing position, and should give\nthe same opportunity to other Industrial Associates. But such is not the\ncase - they paid for it, like an ad, and thus there should be no problem.\nHope these points of clarification will be helpful to you and the committee.\nI hope to be able to meet with you, if at all possible, but the Board meets\nthat morning, so I may not be able to make it. I presume that Betty will\nbe there, however.\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEH/mlm\ncc: Betty McKenzie"
