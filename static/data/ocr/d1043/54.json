It was carefully considered and in essence approved. I guess I\nwill just tell you what the thoughts were and let you make up your own com¬\nplete picture.\n1* It was the feeling of the Committee that the meeting should\nbe held to \"raise the level of educational broadcasting in MIBB Region £•\"\n2. It was suggested that you attempt to hold participants over\nanother day. Traveling expenses will be the bulk of the cost and for very\nlittle more, we should be able to aecoiqplisb a lot more.\n3. It was decided to hold a MAKE Executive Committee meeting prior\nto or following your conference and those officers would be available as\npanel leaders for the conference.\nIt was felt that nearly all of the sessions should be open so\nthat interested non-MAEB members might attend.\n5. It was felt that we should spend perhaps twice the budget you\nindicated. It was our thought that at least 2 persons should attend from\neach meafeer institution, where that is possible. Undoubtedly, some saving\ncould be made by paying only one first-class rail fare and using this to\ndefray the expenses of an automobile which could bring 2 or more people.\nThe Executive Committee specifically approved living expenses in Merman for\nat least 2 people from each active member institution and 1 person from each\nassociate member institution.\n6. The Committee felt that there should be a session on self-\nevaluation by members present. It also felt that If you desired, the fol¬\nlowing people could be called upon to do the following things* Siegel -\ninspirational kick-off message) Faulu - updating on NAEB) Miles - Headquarters\noperation) and Schooley and Ausmua as needed."
