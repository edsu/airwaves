I did feel that we tried to do too much in too little time* Per¬\nhaps the same amount of work in a couple more days would be better* I felt\na little too much pressure*\nSo I am very appreciative of the service extended by the NAEB Engineering service*\nI have found it competent and willing to help with every request* Perhaps\nnew bulletins and brochures of companies available could be listed in a spe¬\ncial section of news letter and made available on request*\nCo D.
