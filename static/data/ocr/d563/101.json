I guess he has more\ntime to prepare it.”\n‘ ‘ My mother likes to watch the telecasts. She says\nshe learns a lot.”\n“My opinion of TV classes is very low. There is\nnot enough class participation.”\n“Because of the excellent outline sheets that are\nprovided, we are able to grasp more.”\n“I asked for thirteen copies of the test given in\nSpanish over television. They were for the Span¬\nish class I give in the basement of our house, for\nmy brothers and sisters and other kids. ’ ’\n‘ ‘ This course really forces you to stay on the ball.\nThe studio teacher moves on each day, and you\nmust work to keep up with her.”\n“I miss the colors and smells in chemistry.”\n‘ ‘ The part I’ve enjoyed most is chemistry. I have\nread several new science books on my own.”"
