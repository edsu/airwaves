Tettemer\nDirector of School Programs\nStation KTCA-TV\nTwin City Area Educational\nTelevision Corporation\nSt. Paul 8, Minnesota\nDear Clair:\nWelcome hack to civilian life — and I hope your two weeks in Washington\nweren't too had.\nRather than have you hill us for the funds for the balance of the utiliza¬\ntion project, I have had a voucher and check prepared in the amount of\n$575 — this to include all expenses not already hilled (such as the $25\nyou estimate we now owe you) and all future expenses you will incur. In\nother words, this winds up the whole thing and you will do as much as you\ncan toward an end product with this sum. You can use these funds to draw\nagainst to complete as much of the project as possible. All you need do\nnow Is to sign the original copy of the voucher and return it to me for\nour records.\nI would suggest that, at the time you return the voucher, you give me a\nrou^i Idea of what you plan to do with the balance of the money, i.e.,\nthe next steps you plan to take and the possible results. Then in the\nnext month or so, as you wind this up, if there is any question in your\nmind about any expenditure you can always consult me. Okay?\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President"
