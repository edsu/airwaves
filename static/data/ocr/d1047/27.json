Harley, President\nN.A.E.B.\nDuPont Circle Office Building\nRooms 1119-1121\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nFrom my conversation with Harry in San Francisco, he indicated that NAEB\nmight be able to underwrite my trip to Japan next May to the tune of a few\nhundred dollars. This was based on the possibility of my being able to\nattend some meeting or conference related to our field of communication.\nHarry said that this had been precedented in the case of John Schwarzwalder\nlast year in Europe.\nMy ability to make this trip to Japan for the purpose of attending the Rotary\nInternational Convention, of which I am District Governor, will depend on\nsupplementary support from some sources. If I am able during my visit\nthere to make, maintain or bulwark present relationships in our field, I am\nat your service.\nI would sincerely appreciate your looking into the matter of possible meetÂ¬\nings or conferences being held in Japan during the last week of May or\nduring the first week in June, 1961. My route of travel will be by way of\nChicago, Seattle, Anchorage, Tokyo, Honolulu, Los Angeles. Might it be\npossible that something enroute, if not actually in Japan, could serve the\nsame purpose?\nI inquire at this date because so many plans hinge on whether I can actually\nswing the matter financially. It will also be necessary to be designated by\nthe NAEB as an official representative in writing in order that I might use\nsuch an official trip for income tax reduction purposes.\nYour personal assistance and study of this question will be most sincerely\nappreciated.\nRDH/ml"
