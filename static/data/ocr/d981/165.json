The participants are the people themselves.\nIn the seven weeks this operation has been in progress three major dis¬\ncoveries have been made:\n1) The people themselves, not experts, but the people themselves, talking,\nthinking, coming to personal decisions on the problem of their community, are the\nmaterial for an exciting and entertaining television program.\n2) This program offers a new and effective way to get expert knowledge\nto the people who are in most need of that knowledge.\n3) By using such a program as the springboard to organized community\nactivity, television can be made to serve—in a totally unique fashion—the fund¬\namental processes of democracy.\nThese discoveries are the result of investigation and experiment by the\nstaff of the Fund for Adult Education TV project, with the cooperation of station\nWOI, several departments of Iowa State College, and several hundred citizens of\na dozen Iowa communities. We have reached our conclusions slowly. Our ideas\nhave changed as our experience has grown. Our primary duty was the creation of\na television program. But The Whole Town's Talking is much more than a series of\nhalf hour shows. It can be tbs center, 'the hsparkplug”, of an integrated process\nof discussion, decision making, and action on a state-wide or even nation-wide\nbasis.\nPerhaps the best way to indicate where we now stand in this total\nprocess is to tell the stoxy of our first telecast, on school reorganization,\nwhich has been developing over the last eight weeks and which will be broadcast\nover WOI-TV on Thursday, January 3, at 8:00 p.m."
