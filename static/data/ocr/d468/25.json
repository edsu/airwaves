Is that how things are always done in a democracy?\nThat’s certainly how things am done here; and the why is really pretty\nsimple. I guess you know we * re pretty proud of ourselves over here in\nAmerica?\nWe observed on the voyage that praises certainly came easily to the\nlips of Americans.\nDon’t be too polite. It’s a little stronger than that. Every book that\ncomes out is exalted to the skies. The public orators flatter the people\nthe people flatter the orators. Clergymen praise their flocks, and the\nflocks stand amased at the excellence of their clergymen...\nI want to inquire about religion in America...\nSunday school teachers admire their pupils, and the scholars magnify\ntheir teachers. And here’s something you’ll find out for yourselves.\nAs far as guests from abroad are concerned, you’ll find that you’re\ngoing to need a dark comer to hide your faces in when everybody starts\nto praise you.\nBut who will praise us, Mr. Schermerhom. We are merely two inquis¬\nitive young men from France. Why are we praiseworthy?\nWell, that’s what I was coming to. We’re boasters! I admit it. We're\nproud of ourselves: I admit that. But we aren’t ell that proud. We\nhaven’t been in business long enough yet. We still aren’t quite sure of\nourselves. We have a lot of hard things to say about the Old Worldj\nbut even while we’re saying them, we’re sometimes casting a look out\nof the comer of our eye to see whether we’ve really impressed them"
