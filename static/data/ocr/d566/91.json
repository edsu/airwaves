Rider, Manager\nUniversity of Illinois\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nInformation About The NAEB Tape Network\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters is\nan organization composed of non-commercial broadcasters and\nstations. Its major purpose is to improve and expand the\nfield of educational broadcasting. As part of its effort, the\nNAEB began a tape network service in 1950. The network\nsupplies significant program series to member stations by\nmeans of tape recordings0 The network covers most of the\nUnited States with the major exception of the Rocky Mountain\nstatesÂ»\nBriefly stated the network operates as follows. The\nonly requirement for participation is membership in the NAEB,\nwhich in turn requires that a station be owned and operated by\na non-commercial organization. Programs are selected by a\ncommittee appointed by the NAEB. Once a program has been\nselected a preliminary offering is made to participating\nstations. They are free to accept or reject programs on\nwhatever basis they choose. Following the preliminary\noffering a final schedule is arranged. Tape recorded copies\nof the program are made and sent to the first station in each\nleg of the network. In succeeding weeks the programs bicycle\naround the regional network legs.\nThe only cost to the participating stations is the\npostage to ship the tapes to the next station, and some\ncorrespondence with the network headquarters, 'All programs\nare sent out on tape at the standardized speed of 7k inches\nper second."
