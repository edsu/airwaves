Mott\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nAs Cindy may have told you, I have for the past ten days been\nstruggling with this year's \"big decision.\" American University\noffered me the position of Director of Telecommunications, which\nof course included becoming station manager for WAMU-FM. After\nmuch thought, floor-pacing, etc., I have, somewhat regretfully,\ndecided to stay here, get the Ph.D. at Columbia, and then seek\nmy fortune.\nAt the moment, I have not heard who else the university may be\nconsidering. It could be a wonderful job â€” or very trying, or\neven both, as you know, and I hope they get someone who sees\nall the dimensions of the situation there. If Columbia and\nthe Corporation weren't giving me such a good deal here, I\nwould have accepted the A.U. offer. It's one of those decisions\nthat I will never be sure about, but at least it's made.\nHope to see you on Friday, May 23, when Cindy and I are planning\nto get together to discuss questionnaires, mailing lists, and\nother radio data. I will be returning to Washington for the\nsummer, and teaching two courses at A.U. in June and July.\nWe \"corporate\" people are about ready to move into our new\nbuilding. The CPB has had so many address changes that eventually\nnobody will be able to locate us. Which may be the idea.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nElizabeth L. Young"
