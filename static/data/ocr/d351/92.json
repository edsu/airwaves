I favor the idea. I\nknow that the National Audience Board would help spread\nthe word.\nI think that Harcus and Franklin Bouwsma have a good\nidea there. Perhaps some wealthy individual, who would be\na declared Chairman of the National Educational Radio and\nTelevision Week, would shell out the money to pay for the\nweek.\nThanks for the communication.\nBest regards,\nBernard F.
