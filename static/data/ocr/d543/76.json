Harley\n600 North Park\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nThanks for Executive Newsletter number one. It is a\nWONDERFUL IDEA, AND I HOPE YOU ARE ABLE TO KEEP IT UP.\nI AM GLAD TO KNOW I WAS NOT ALONE ON THE SPECIAL BOARD\nMEETING, AND I AM SORRY JOHN FELT IT NECESSARY TO SEND OUT\nHIS NASTY NOTE.\nI AM GLAD YOU HAVE TOLD THE BOARD MEMBERS THE DEVELOP¬\nMENTS ON THE AIRBORNE PROJECT. THIS DOES LOOK EXCITING. I\nONLY HOPE WE CAN GET FAVORABLE NAEB ACTION AND FAVORABLE FCC\nACTION ON THIS MATTER. INCIDENTALLY, WHO IS PREPARING THE\nINVITATION LIST FOR THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE? UP UNTIL THIS\nTIME I FELT I HAD NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE. I AM STILL NOT SURE\nI CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION, BUT IN VIEW OF THE AIRBORNE DEVELOP¬\nMENTS AND THE FACT THAT THE AIRBORNE GROUP IS TO MEET IN\nWashington on those same dates, I would greatly appreciate an\nINVITATION TO THE MEETING EVEN THOUGH PURDUE OR THE AIRBORNE\nPROJECT PAID MY EXPENSES.\nThe Washington move does look imminent. I hope your\nHUNTING EXPEDITION IN WASHINGTON IS A SUCCESS. I*D ALSO BE\nINTERESTED IN HEARING MORE ABOUT THE SPEECH AND HEARING\nAssociation's experience.\nYour briefing on the Constitution is excellent. Harold\nHill has commented on our dittoed draft and made a list of\nCORRECTIONS, MAINLY TYPOGRAPHICAL AND OMISSIONS. WHEN WE HAVE\nHAD A CHANCE TO CORRECT IT, WE WILL SEE THAT IT IS SENT TO THE\nINDIVIDUAL BOARD MEMBERS.\nTHE VOICE OF\nPURDUE\nf WltAA1-1\""
