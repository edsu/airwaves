Miles, Director\nProgram Service and Distribution Division\nMidwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction\nMemorial Center - Purdue University\nLafayette, Indiana\nDear Jim:\nI am returning herewith some of the slides you gave to me together\nwith the additional slides I had made from the pictures you provided.\nBecause I waited until the last minute, the local eamera shop didn't\nhave the proper close-up equipment; so these elides are not the best\npossible professional quality.\nAs I anticipated, the portiono&f my presentation at Montreux, at the\nWorld's First International Festival on Television Arts and Sciences,\nwhich provoked the most interest was the section dealing with the\nAirborne Project. I showed the slides and was able to say that I had\njust come from Purdue where I wathced the successful test signal.\nThanks to you for all your good help and to both you and your wife for\nyour hospitality on my visit to Lafayette.\nCodlially,\nWGH:rkf\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident"
