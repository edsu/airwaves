Several basic\nproblems were discussed and the following decisions reached:\n1. Committee members shall report on all audition tapes within two\nweeks of their receipt from Headquarters. Copies of the reports\nshall be sent to both Abbot and Eolt0\n20 At the end of the time limit, the chairman is authorized to make\na final decision based on the votes that have been received, so\nlong as at least three votes have been recorded.\n3. In case of a tie vote on the acceptance or rejection of any program,\nthe decision shall be made by the chairman.\n4* The committee is to consider the feasibility of planning one or\nmore series in the areas in which the network is now weak (for\nexample, dram) and asking certain member stations to produce\nprograms for the series. The various programs, from the various\nstations, would then be combined into one series. It was felt\nthat this might be advisable in order not to over-burden any one\nstation. The need for a good dramatic series was emphasized."
