It would scarcely be unfair to say that Madame\nde Sevigne had no clear notion of suffering in anyone who was not a\nperson of quality,\nI see what you mean; and that certainly isn9t true here. We have our\nfaults; but on the whole, I believe we?re a humanitarian people. We\nlike to think well of people; and usually we have a basic belief in\nfair play.\nBut, Mr, Governor, to return to the question of the soldiers.\nOh yes, the question of the soldiers. Why arenH there ary: 'that\nwhat you mean?\nExactly, It is remarkable to us that the streets of this city are empty\nof soldiers.\nOr is this just peculiar to the City of New York? We have alreactyâ€™ been\ntold several times that New York is not, after all, America,\nNor it is; but vvjl won*t find much in the way of soldiers wherever you\ngo. As I said, we3re on an adventure; every man jack has a stake in\nthe country, It5s to his own benefit to live in a peaceful, happy\ncommunity. Everything, in short, is regulated, as far as possible,\nby enlightened self-interest.\nCould you give us an example, Mr, Governor?\nI could give you ten thousand; but here8 s one you can hang on to.\nThere was a fellow I knew in Massachusetts; carpenter, by trade.\nTHRDOP:"
