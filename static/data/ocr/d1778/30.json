(Browne)\nCOMMENT: Ifeny effective TV courses could be equally effective on radio. (Arms)\nQUESTION: Yihat are some of the things that don't go well on TV? If there\nare things, probably we just haven't learned how to do them. Some\nsay that intangible values of classroom teaching can't be achieved\nwith TV. A1 Eurich has made the perfect comment on this point:\nnIn some 2000 years of education nobody has ever been able to\nmeasure these intangible values, now why put the burden of proof\non ETV?” (Schenkkan)\nCOMMENT: In a U* H. classroom with 90 students, we found the students\noften resented questions that interrupted lectures. (Arms)\nQUESTION: If TV is to do any good at the University of Colorado, we will\nneed year in, year out classes on TV. A year of experimentation\nwon't help. Will ETV stations be able to do this? To cover the\ncurriculum year after year would kinneys shown in classrooms be\nthe answer? (DoKieffer)\nANSWER: Yes, kinneys, perhaps shown at night, could do the job. (Arms)\nQUESTION: How do students like TV courses?\nANSWER: In a survey of University of Houston students who had taken TV\ncourses and watched wherever they wished, we found that about 1C$\npreferred olassroom oourses, about 2,1%> preferred TV courses, and\nabout 68% had no preference. The student attitude toward TV is\nmuch affeoted by the instructor. (Schwarzwalder)"
