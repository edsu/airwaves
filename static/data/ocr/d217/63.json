I have sent one copy to the manager of\n| Mexico’s educational station, XFUN, one copy to Cuba’s educational\n1 outlet, CMZ, and will send the others to similar broadcasters in\n| a few of the other Latin American republics. So the AERT name will\nj be ci culated where it can get more latinos interested in\nI our group here.\nI hope when it is convenient, you will send that film we discussed\nin person (dealing with use of equipment), so that my fledglings in\nbroadcast can see it.\nThanks again.\nBest wishes, and\nCordially,\n7^h4/\nMarvin Alisky\nAsst.
