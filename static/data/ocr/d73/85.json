The entire salary scale could be\nraised, at lower cost per student. With higher\nsalaries would come increased stature for the\nteacher in his own community. These factors\nwould, in turn, keep able men and women in\nthe teaching ranks, and attract new teachers\nof the highest caliber.\nSince our nationwide requirements for\nteachers can never be met by present methods,\ntelevision certainly poses no problem of un¬\nemployment for teachers.\n3. Closed-circuit TV can make it possible for\nthe teacher to give greater attention to the indi¬\nvidual student. Once the classroom instructor\nhas been freed from many of the chores he\nnow performs, he will be able to devote far\nmore time to personal counseling. Indeed,\nthis opportunity for individualized instruc¬\ntion is one of the great advantages of tele¬\nvision, magnetic tape and other electronic aids\nto education.\nThey permit the teacher to reach the stu¬\ndent on a highly personal basis. They enable\neach student, in effect, to set his own pace.\nThe fast-learner in a particular subject, is\nchallenged to work up to his full capacity. The\naverage-learner is encouraged to develop what\ngifts he possesses. The slow-learner is assured\nof the kind of attention that will prevent his\nfalling hopelessly behind.\nA student might be in the third grade in\nspelling, the second grade in arithmetic, and\nthe fourth grade in history. We do not have\nequal abilities.\n8"
