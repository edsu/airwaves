Staff is as followss Mr. Lent has a third class ticket;\nthere is a student with a third class ticket. It is difficult to get student\ninterest because there is a carrier current station on campus which operates\nwith no faculty supervision; the students have 'carte blanche' in programming\nand operation. Since last June, WUSC has been putting one program, THE UNIVER*\nSITY FORUM, on a commercial station. In April they plan to go on commercial\ntelevision. The Junior League has kept radio alive in the schools in this com¬\nmunity. They have found an 'angel' to pay for program rentals and persuaded\nstations to donate time, A regular report form is in use among the schools and\nprepared manuals are available to teachers for NAEB shows. There are still\nserious difficulties in lack of receivers and usage of equipment.\nTelevision\nNot very much progress has been made with the 4 allocations for South Carolina.\nAlthough the Superintendent of Public Instruction has expressed interest, he\nfeels reluctant to approach the governor. A meeting has been called for the\nColumbia area on March 16 and 600 to 700 invitations have been sent out to per¬\nsons within a 60-mile radius of Columbia, an area including 900,000 persons—\n250,000 of them children. At this meeting an effort is going to be made to\narouse some real interest. The state has had an $.8,000,000 surplus, but the\ngovernor has already allocated these funds. In is not considered practicable\nto approach the present Assembly. The folks in Charleston have worked hard\nbecause the Charleston allocation is the most vulnerable one. It is too early\nto say whether they will be successful or not. It is hoped that the Columbia\ngroup will manage to arouse public support for a station in that area. No action\nis expected with the other two allocations.\nVIRGINA: Carroll B. Lusk, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts\nRadio\nThere are no educational stations in Virginia.

The Arlington school system put 6g- hours of television programs\non commercial stations last year and is this year producing a series on alter¬\nnate Saturdays. A series on school work has been planned for the spring. WNAL\nhas, however, reneged on the proffered time for this series. (All educational\nbroadcasters, please note). Arlington will offer the series to another station.\nThey have a high-powered Speech Advisory Council including persons from commer¬\ncial stations and Frank Durham of the U.S. Department of Education. The Council\nconsists of 15 persons who meet 6 times a year. They have found their public re¬\nlations program very helpful in the development of radio-television."
