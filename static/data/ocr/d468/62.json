How\ndid you make out?\nHow do you think I mad© out? Saw him, of course; had a long talk with\nhim.\nWhat!\nHe8s a real gentleman, I can tell you. When I gave him that acorn X\nshowed you, he set great store hy it; said there was no character in\nancient or modem history that he admired as much as he did our General\nWashington. He said he'd plant it in his palace garden with his own hand.\nIt was very kind of him to say that.\nHe did it, too. I watched him with my own eyes. And all the things he\nwanted to ask me about our schools, and rail-roads, and one thing or\nanother; well, he invited me to come again and meet his daughters.\nSaid his wife could speak English better than he could. So she could,\ntoo; though he did pretty well for a Russian.\nAnd did you meet the princesses and the Tsarina, the Empress?\nThe wife? Sure; and she's a fine, knowing woman, I tell you; and his\ndaughters are nice gals.\nWhat did the Empress say to you?\nOh, she asked me a sight of questions. And do you know, she thought\nwe had no servants in America. Well, I told her, poor folks did their\nown work, but rich folk had plenty of servants. \"Aha,” says she,\n\"But then you don't call them servants,” says she, \"you call 'em help,\"\nsays she® \"Hay,\" says I, \"I guess you've been reading books about us.\""
