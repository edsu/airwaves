Hess\nCoordinator, Instructional Television\nUniversity of California\nSanta Barbara, California\nDear Gary:\nEnclosed is a photocopy of a letter I received last summer\nfrom Vic Hyden. In view of the fact he had been privy to\nearlier correspondence between Ken Winslow and others on the\nWest Coast and me, I believe you can understand why Z didn't\nfeel he expected an answer.
