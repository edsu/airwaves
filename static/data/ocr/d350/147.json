Van DUYN\nASSOCIATE DIRECTOR\nMr. Graydon Ausmus\nWUOA, University of Alabama\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Mr. Ausmus:\nWe have spent considerable time in reviewing some possible\nnames to suggest to you and your committee for the Executive\nSecretary of NAEB. I regret to inform you that we have not\nbeen able to come up with any additional names other than the\nones that Bob VanDuyn suggested to you the other afternoon\nwhile you and Wilbur Schramm were visiting with us.\nThe two people I had in mind, after further investigation and\nstudy, I do not believe are the people that we should recomÂ¬\nmend to you for consideration. If we think of any names in\nthe next day or two, we shall be glad to send them to you.\nI wish you a lot of success in your undertaking.\nPlease take good care of the camellias. I hope to have the\nopportunity of seeing them sometime.\nSincerely,\nHugh Masters\nHBM:ees"
