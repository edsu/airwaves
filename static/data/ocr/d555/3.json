If Professor Buell plans to omit\nall time references, I see no reason why he should\nnot record 8 programs this summer for use by the\nnetwork beginning in October. I think John is\nright when he suggests that we could leave it up\nto each station to either start the first one in\nSeptember or the fifth in October. John, you\nsay these commentaries are 30 minutes each -- I\nwas sure they were only 15?"
