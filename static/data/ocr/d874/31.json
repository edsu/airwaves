Kellogg Foundation for a three-year grant (for the\nperiod July 1, 1956 to June 30, 1959), and the terms of the subsequent grant,\nstipulated that, of the total proposed annual budget for Headquarters, $3,840\nwas to be obtained from income other than the grant (such as sale of publications,\nreimbursable services, etc.). Since, under our agreement with the University of\nIllinois, such miscellaneou income must be credited to our Network account,\nthis $3,840 had first to accrue to the latter account and then be transferred to the\nTtusts Kellogg account."
