Becker\nExecutive Secretary\nTelevision Center\nState University of Iowa\n609 10th Avenue\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nThanks for your fine letter, full of ideas, on Research Committee\nthinking. It*s a real hat full. We*11 see if we can*t get going.\nWe*re in a bind with Ford, at present. They*11 give us funds, only\nif we give up our Radio Network, it appears. And that letter is\ngoing to take a bit of time to resolve. So far the Board has decided\nto keep it, so at least one network in the United States isnÂ»t subject\nto Foundation and/or industry taboos. It*s a tough one. But we*re\nmeeting (finance committee) Tuesday in Chicago to try to get wheels\nturning.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJS:jp"
