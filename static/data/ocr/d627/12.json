Wood\nGale Adkins sent me a note the other day and I was\nrelieved to hear from him. The last word I had was\nat the N.A.E.B. Convention when Paula was ill.\nA few weeks ago I wrote to Elizabeth Marshall about\ndoing some utilization kits for us. Since writing\nyou last week, I have heard from Liz and she is quite\ninterested in the project. She made several suggestions\nabout clearing the protocol channels in the Chicago\npower structure which I have started to do. I think\nshe will be a wonderful addition to the committee and\nif all goes well, her material should be available for\ndistribution by the first or middle of May.\nThe dittoed \"draft proposal\" has not been submitted\nas yet. Actually, I had thought of this as a working\npaper. As I told you in my letter yesterday, I’m not\nexactly sure about the proper channels for submitting\nproposals under part B of the Title VII authorization.\nIt seems that the first thing we should do is get to¬\ngether to draft or write a final request. While this\nmaterial I have put together will help, I'm sure it is\nin the wrong form and we need to make a stronger and\nmore logical case for the project. Also, I’m sure that\nthey will want to know something about budget and time\nexpectations."
