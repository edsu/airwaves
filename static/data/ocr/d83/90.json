J* , /&\\ ^\nKinescopes are being made in New York now. Bills r\nfrom the Canadian National Film Board (about $80),\nfrom the Jam Handy Film Services and from the Wayne\nState Educational Station - $225 and $975 respectively -\nwill be going to you direct before long.\nI think we shall have reason to feel rather\npleased with this video and you can be sure that it\nwill, at the very least, get a great deal of attenÂ¬\ntion.\nThe $975 price includes the cost of 3 kinescopes\nat $125A Piece. However, the total bill may prove\nto be somewhat larger.\nBest regards.\nMarshall McLuhan"
