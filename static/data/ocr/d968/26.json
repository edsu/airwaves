McCarthy\nSenace\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 8, 1967\nDear Senator McCarthy:\nAs you know, President Johnson has recently proposed new legislation\nfor educational broadcasting to be known as the Public Television Act\nof 1967. The Administration bill should be introduced very shortly\nby Senator Magnuson and Representative Harley Staggers.\nThis bill is of particular interest to us, at St. John’s, because for\nthe first time educational radio has been included in federal legislation\ndesigned to encourage educational broadcasting.\nHaving realized the potential of educational radio and the contribution\nit can make in our area, both in terms of providing instructional and\neducational programs as well as its ability to present cultural and fine\narts programming, we have established a high power FM educational station\nhere in Collegeville and we have applied to the F.C.C. for a second\ntransmitter in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\nOur studies indicate that educational radio is as effective as television\nand often times a more effective medium for the presentation of this type\nof programming, while offering a considerably more economical basis of\noperation to the small college.\nIn addition to our broadcasting efforts at St. John's, we have, during\nthe past several months, been in discussion with the Minnesota Private\nColleges, concerned with the need for a non-commercial FM educational\nradio service for the state. The conclusions drawn at these meetings\nindicate that the demands of our contemporary society require educational\ninstitutions to be more than storehouses of accumulated knowledge; that\ntoday's university must function actively as a contributing member of\nthe society that sustains it, sharing its resources and experience with\nthe community generally."
