  "text": "Mechanical duality\nUp to the writing of this report we have received two\ncomplaints on the mechanical <cuality of tapes circulated* These\ntwo both were about the series, Los Angeles County Museum Chamber\nMusic Concerts* This brings up a very important problem0\nFirst, let us consider the specific program about which\ncomplaints were received* This series has not operated on an\nideal basis* Not all of the tapes, nor all the information on\nthe series was at hand when the series started. Some of the tapes\non which it was received were in very poor physical condition* It\nwas the first series which vie sent out* It was done rather hurriedly*\nIt is possible th?t either in the original recording, or in dubbing\nthem sticky tape caused occasional distortions. It may have been the\nresult of poor dubbing here* 'When the tapes mentioned as poor are\nreturned, we will check every possible cause.\nAs to mechanical quality in general, be have not thus far\nhad equipment of sufficient character to accurately check on quality,\nWe hope this will be remedied very soon. It also seems necessary to\nset quite definite standards for the recording of programs, especially\nmusic. Tapes in the best possible mechanical condition should be\nused for the .lasters. It is assumed that the mass duplicator will\nresult in a high degree of fidelity. The problem seems to be,\ntherefore, to get good masters*\nWhen the quality of music programs is to be judged, what\nis needed is a person with sufficient musical acumen to note subtle\ndistortions* Such a person is available at the University, If\nhis services can be obtained for this purf^^n^Qlhelp to\navoid any future difficulties with the mechanical quality of\nmusical programs*\n-17~*"
