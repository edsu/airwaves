Since the scripts are already so heavily phonology-oriented,\nLP's would not contain phonological material.\n3. Thi3 material is aimed at students who are at least \"two-plus,\nF.S.I.”\nB. CONTENTS OF LP'S:\nLP's should contain explanations of some of the lexical and\ngrammatical phenomena contained in the dialogs. These explana¬\ntions should be suitable for an “intermediate” student.\nLP's might also contain written* exercises based on the\nexplanations.\nIf exercises are included then an answer sheet must be made\navailable.\nC. SAMPLE LP OUTLINE (based on dialog - 3);\n1. Grammatical Coverage\nGrammatical explanations should be provided for at least\nthe following:\na: “—finish reading—”\n\"Finish” requires a \"Ving\" and not a \"to W.\"\nb: \"Itold him that he—\"\nDirect vs. indirect quotation.\n\"Say\" vs. “Tell.”\nc: \"Let's invite him—\"\nSuggastlves \"Let's\", \"Shall we\" vs. imperatives.\n2. Lexical Coverage\na: Topic-oriented lexical items (including some not in\nthe dialog):\npass/fail exam papers\ncourse examination\nsemester record\ngrade « mark term\nSentences exemplifying the use of the above items.\n* It follows from assumption - 1 that oral drills could not be used."
