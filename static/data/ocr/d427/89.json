THE DEFICIT. Xou will recall that the Board approved\ntransfer of funds from TSg’IIaeB treasury into the headquarters fund to\ncover a portion of our deficit, subject to my conference with VanDuyn©\nActing in good faith with the Foundation I believe it is now appropriate\nfor us to make this transfer of the $3000,00, or more if we can safely\ndo so, into th© headquarters budget. Mien I receive word from Schooley\nand/or Skornia that the grants-in-aid surplus and the NAEB surplus have\nbeen transferred to the headquarters deficit, I will write Bob that we\nhave reduced the \"potential” deficit by that much and request a suggestion\nfrom him concerning the remaining “pctontial” deficit,\nI believe this is a strictly legal and desirable procedure and unless a\nmajority of the Board, by air-mail letter to Skornia or Schooley (carbon\nto me please), indicates an opinion to th© contrary by early next week,\nthese gentlemen should proceed as suggested©"
