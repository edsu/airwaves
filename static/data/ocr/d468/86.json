It is\nbecause the ministers of the various sects have never entered\npolitics and have never been or pretended to bo a political power*\n¥e should think that we were injuring our standing if we were to\nconcern ourselves with a political matter, A great number among\nus even abstain from voting at the elections; that!s what I myself\nam always careful to do*\nBut we have noticed in America political ideas seem to be invested\nwith what you might almost call a religious aura*\nVery true * very true * Mr, Beaumont; a religious aura; but not a\nsectarian one, You are quite right If you feel that to the vast\nmajority of Americans the Union itself has an almost sacred feeling\nconnected with it, This is why wo find it so hard to reply when\npeople ask us what is the value of the Union, what is the use of\nthe Union? The question is as offensive as to ask any right\nminded man what is the use of religion* The Union is more than a\nmatter of high utility to Americans* It has been idealised into\nan object of love and veneration* Me cry in our hearts with King\nLear: n0 reason not the need51, In our political and public life,\nwe frown upon clericalism; but we warmly encourage religion* Have\nyou seen yesterday3® paper? The New York Spectator?\nX believe not*\nX have it by me, and 13XI find you a paragraph which will impress you\nPAPER HUSTLING-\nA witness appeared in court and declared that he did not believe\nin the immortality of the soul; and the Judge refused to admit any\nof ills evidence on the grounds that he had destroyed the confidence\nof the court in the truth of whatever he was about to say* Hero\nwe are: road it for yourself] there."
