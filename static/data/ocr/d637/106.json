(At present the charge-per-reel is <£2*00, as\nannounced last December. Aierefore, if a station9s basic assessment is\ns^600 and the station orders only 21 reels of in-school programs, it will\nbe charged ^42, It will not be charged one^quarter of s?600, or 9I5O,)\nc« Co Skoraia\nHill\nAusmus\nMacandrew\nHolt\nBlackburn"
