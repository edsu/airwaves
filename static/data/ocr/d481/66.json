It may be that we should not file any\ncomment. I think, however, that many of us may\nattach a great deal more importance to Auer’s\nprologue than you do.\nThe point is that the first paragraph is proba¬\nbly all any broadcasters are going to read.\nSven if they read further, their view of the\nspecific suggestions made by the Speech group\nwill be colored by the emotional reaction they\nhave had to thgprologue. This is precisely the\nreason I am disturbed; because these people feel\nthat commercial broadcasters ought to be helping\nus. In my view, it would be better if they had\nleft us out of it altogether. I think it is\nperfectly possible to make every suggestion\nwhich this group has made and to make friends\namong the broadcasters at the same time.\nAs to whether we should express ourselves for¬\nmally to the Commission in disassociation from\nthis point of view, I don’t know. 1 leave this\nto your Judgment.\nSincerely,\nH. P. Schenkkan\nRPS:am\ncc: Will lam Harley 2**^\nLeonard H. Marks"
