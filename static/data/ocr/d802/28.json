Brandeis, perhaps more than any other individual, had so\nmuch to do with the expanded horizons of our present way of life, from\nthe standpoint of social, economic and industrial legislation, certainly\nhe deserves so much recognition? Considering his background and the\nabsorbing humanness and individuality of the man, the drama and conflict\nof his life, there should be ample material for an inspiring and.\ninformative series titled, perhaps, BRANDEIS: DISSENTING PROPHET. As\nlawyer and justice, LDB was first a determinedly free American and a\nsingularly conscientious citizen, yet nearly all that the average\nsupposedly^well-educated, well-informed individual knows about him is\nthat he was a Jew and a Supreme Court Justice. In view of his monumental\ncontribution to the American way of life, isn't it about time something\nwas done/bring the facts home tb a thoughtful few at least?\nto\nMay I suggest that Claude Rains would be an admirable choice to portray\nMr. Brandeis.? Or Raymond Massey. And as technical adviser who could\npossibly be a better choice than Dr. Alpheus Thomas ’ ason, currently\nMcCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University? Dr. Mason's\nBRANDEIS: LAWYER AND JUDGE IN THE MODERN STATE and BRANDEIS: A FREE MAN'S\nLIFE are authoritative, definitive — and superb reading! They could, I\nshould think, form the point of departure for a superb radio series to\nsupplement and implement THE JEFFERSONIAN HERITAGE.\nSincerely,\n(Laura Eliza Bliven)\nPostoffice Box 405\nCedar Rapids, Iowa"
