All of these surveys used the same questionnaire for\nthe same population#\n2# The size of the sample seems adequate to accomplish the major\npurpose of the study#\n3# It seems safe, then, to conclude that although there are some\nfactors which effect the projection of the sample to the universe\nand there are sane factors which tend to minimize the validity of\nthe responses, they seem to be offset by the little change between\nsurvey 1 and survey 2 of this report, the size of the sample, and\nby the randomness with which these factors occur.\nIt is with these limitations in mind that the conclusions of this\nreport are made,"
