State Networks and State Network Planst\nA state network exists in Alabama* One was planned for Oklahoma,\nthough little has been accomplished on this# Florida is actively-\nplanning a state network and Ohio has formulated an excellent state\nnetwork plan# All of these have some relevance to this study but,\nsince all are confined to one state, they are of only moderate\nvalue to those planning an interstate network# In programming,\nadministration and policy formulation, no state network can pro¬\nvide guidance to a regional network on which many states must\nagree and in which both public and private (non-profit) insitutions\nare involved#\nb* Southern Regional Education Board Educational Television Proposals\nThe Southern Regional Education Board has proposed, for activation\nin the future, a regional network of some fourteen southern states#\nIts proposals differ from the present proposals in the following\nhighly important respectss\n1# The Southern Regional Education Board is a quasi-govem-\nmental organization unique in this country# Its proposals\nhave little relevance to regional planning where no such\norganization exists*\n2# Educational television is only one aspect of the activities\nof the Southern Regional Education Board# It cannot devote\nits full energies to educational television nor does it\npropose to do so*\n3# Many states represented in the Southern Regional Education\nBoard have no educational television stations and contemplate\nnone at this time# Because of this and because of the politi¬\ncal necessity of including all states in the plan, the\nSouthern Regional Education Board plan calls for the inclu¬\nsion of\"production centers\" and closed-circuit television\nfacilities within its network* This, again, differs greatly\nfrom the present proposal which confines itself solely to a\nnetwork of television stations*\nc* The Educational Television and Radio Center sometimes refers to itself as\nNET, meaning National Educational Television, but its distribution of pro¬\ngrams is almost entirely by means of film and kinescope recordings and\nit has no present plans for activation of a live network#\nV# Procedure:\nA# General Methods If, as we assume, encouragement of experimentation in\nbetter use of educational television is one of the purposes of Title\nVII, then procedures should be followed in this project which will\nprovide a basis for greater use of educational television by more\npeople# The procedure proposed falls under the following divisionss"
