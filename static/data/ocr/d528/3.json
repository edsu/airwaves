Mott,\nExecutive Director, National\nEducational Radio\n13iji> Conn Ave NW\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nI have reference to the amendment to the Public Broadcasting Financing\nAct of 1970 which proposes, among other things, that CPB~qualifying\nstations keep audio recordings of all programs involving issues of\npublic importance for a period of approximately three months. If\nCongress and the general public were to interpret the wording of this\namendment in its broadest sense, I believe the results would be\ndisastrous for public radio stations.\nI think it would be safe to say that as much as four hours a day of\nprograms broadcast by WU0M/WVGR involve issues of public importance.\nThis includes news, commentary, lectures, panel discussions, etc.\nIn a three month period this would amount to some 361+ hours of\nprogramming. Assuming that a station had equipment available at all\ntimes to record and/or play back, a fact which I strongly doubt, the\ninvestment in tape alone would be in the neighborhood of $251*8.\nIf Congress pursues this policy, it would appear to me that the\npenalties imposed on individual stations would soon outweigh# the\nbenefits received from participating in the activities and benefits\nof the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\nThe existing requirements that copies be made and kept of programs\nspecifically underwritten by the Corporation, and the existing\nrules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission with\nits machinery for handling complaints of unfairness, appear to me\nquite sufficient for protecting the public interest. I would\nstrongly urge NAEB/NER to advocate revision of the amendments wording\nor its eliiination entirely.\nCordially,"
