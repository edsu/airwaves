I was most impressed with the work of\nthe NAEB and I am rushing Yale^s application for associate membership.\nFor your acceptance committee*s benefit, I would like to repeat the\nnature of the present YALE REPORTS program.\nIt is a weekly l5-minute broadcast, featuring members of the Yale\nfac\\ilty and visitors to the university. We usually run series of three\nto four consecutive broadcasts on one subject and then break it up with\na \"one shot\" — an interview with a distinguished visitor: e.g., Clement\nAtlee, Dean Acheson, Paul Tillich.\nThe format varies from straight interview to discuission; on location\nreports and conversation with illustrative inserts (like the music series\nwe*re sending you).\nYALE REPORTS is broadcast by Station WTIC in Hartford every Sunday\nevening at 6:15; by WGBH, Boston, WEDK, Springfield and ¥AMC, Albany.\nI am enclosing a listing of available tapes for your consideration\nand am sending under separate cover sample tapes of one full series and\nbroadcasts of parts of series as well as one of our \"one shot\" interviews\nwith a distinguished visitor.\nThe Yale News Bureau helps publicize the programs by issuing news\nreleases based on each broadcast and our newspaper coverage has been\nnationwide. Should NAEB carry out series we would be glad to work out\nadditional promotion.\nAs I mentioned in Urbana, YALE REPORTS may become a half hour pro¬\ngram next year and we would also like to develop other series specifically\nfor you. We have the talent and the facilities here and we feel the time\nhas definitely come for Yale to do more."
