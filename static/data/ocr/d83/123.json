Should any ideas or film\nclips occur to you in connection with any of the shots,\nplease scribble a note.\nEllery and Dreyfus think they can do it for about'\n£400 out of our budget, and are charging this only because\nthey want to do it on a Saturday in order to do a better\njob. This will mean paying a few fees.\nA bit of luck while staying with Bob Shafer when\nKen McCrorle and his wife turned up, so they worked over\nthe script with me.

But we shall strive for\na good deal of animation both in the cartoon and film form,\n:usanne Shafer is doing her Doctorate at Ann Arbor on\nthe effects of the American educational program in Germany,\nI have urged her to get in touch with you concerning radio\ncontinued,"
