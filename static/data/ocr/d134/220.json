The processes of the external world\ncannot be described in terms of familiar images; whether we\ndescribe them by words or by symbols their intrinsic nature\nremains unknown. But they are the vehicle of a scheme of\nrelationship which can be described by numbers, and so give\nrise to those numerical measures (pointer-readings) which\nare the data from which all knowledge of the external uni¬\nverse is Inferred.\n”Our account of the external world (when purged of the\nInventions of the story teller In consciousness) must neces¬\nsarily be a Jabberwocky\" of unknowable actors executing\nunknowable actions. How In these conditions can we arrive\nat any knowledge at all? We must seek a knowledge which is\nneither of actors nor of actions, but of which the actors and\nactions are a vehicle. The knowledge we can acquire is\nknowledge of a structure or pattern contained In the actions.\n/ that artist “ay Partly understand what I mean.\"\nIP.256).\nAfter 3000 years of writing, and 500 years of printing. Western\nman Is not surprisingly devoted to the Idea of knowledge as a\nstatlo, repeatable aspect or item, Eddington Is saying that\nall along we have never had ary knowledge of content or com¬\nponent, But he Is not saying that we have not had knowledge.\nWe have really had a higher form of knowledge than our theories,\nour speculative Instruments and our Instructional materials\nwould permit us to recognize. Our knowledge Is of the dynamic"
