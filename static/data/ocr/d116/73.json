I am sorry that these\nhave not been made out on regular voucher forms, and I hope\nthat the letter claims will be a satisfactory basis for your\nmailing checks to both of these gentlemen without delay*\nI am also enclosing a bill from the Public Service Letter\nk Printing Co. for #11*01, as well as their statement for #493*88.\nThis latter amount was forwarded to you for payment last week.\nI appreciate the speed and efficiency with which you handled\nthe incoming checks. I realise that this is a severe drain on your\ntime, and I am hoping that seme concrete method of acknowledging\nthis added service will be approved at the next Board of Directors\nmeeting.\nI wonder whether it would be possible to receive a monthly\nreport from you on our financial status* This need only include\nthe financial transactions during the month, and a final figure\nof our balance.\nSuch financial statements would be of inestimable help to\nthe Directors when they meet again, either in January or February.\nWith all best wishes, I am\nAs ever.\nSeymour W.
