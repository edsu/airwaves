  "text": "5 (b)\nAs President of the NAEB, I wrote in October 1965 to your\nSecretary—General to inquire about the possibility of NAEB\nbecoming as Associate Member of the ABU. At that time, I\nsaid that the operational expenditure of all our members\ncould not be exactly stated but might be in the vicinity\nof $US 35,000,000* I also said then that we would find it\ndifficult to pay more tha* $US 500 per annum* You will\nunderstand that our members include many schools, colleges,\nuniversities and State Education Department, most of whose\noperations are run, in varying degrees, on a voluntary basis*\n1 should explain that the figure quoted in 1965 included the cost\nof maintaining educational programmes transmitted within educa¬\ntional institutions by means of closed circuits and vfaieh,\ntherefore, are not strictly \"broadcast” services* The total\nalso included a rough estimate of the value of services\nprovided cm a voluntary basis* If these two factors are\nexcluded from your calculations, as we believe they should,\nthe operations! expenditure of NAEB could be estimated at less\nthan $25,000,000 and therefore would place the NAEB in the\ncategory or group which, X understand, pay 10 units of $100\neach, an amount which the NAEB would be prepared to pay*"
