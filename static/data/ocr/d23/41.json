  "text": "each proposal for remote operation with a directional antenna should be\naccompanied by a sworn statement, by a competent engineer, describing the\noperational stability of the array. Comments with respect to the data\nproposed tc be required by the Federal Communications Commission in Section\n9 are as follows:\nSection 9(1)\n\"Weekly monitoring point readings for one year\nprlor~to the submission of the data.\"\nMonitoring point readings are of value in determining the\noperational stability of the array. Other measurements which usually exist\nin a station’s record may however be just as Important. Reference is made\nto \"Report on Propagation Conditions Affecting Field Intensities at Radio\nStation WRNL, Richmond, Virginia”, dated December 1947 by Delmer C. Ports,\nwhich has been previously filed with the Federal Communications Commission.\nFigure 4 from this engineering report is appended hereto. Other reports\npreviously submitted by Jansky & Bailey, Inc. relating to such conditions,\nwhich may occur in certain sections of the country were submitted on behalf\nof WRNL and dated February 1947 and April 1949. Similar conditions existing\nat WNBF, Binghamton, New York are analyzed and treated in reports on file\nwith the Federal Communications Commission dated August 1949, January 1952\nand August 1952. Reference is also directed to the paper Temperature\nVariations of Ground Wave Signal Intensity at Standard Broadcast Frequencies”\nby Frederick R. Gracely of the Federal Communications Commission, which\nappeared in the April 1949 issue of the Proceedings of the Institute of\nRadio Engineers. While this latter paper deals with greater distances than\nthose of immediate concern it is illustrative of a factor which will probably\nneed to be accounted for as data are analyzed.\n~ 5 -"
