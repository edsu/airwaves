Many tools help scientists do their work.\nScience uses three different ways of learning. It provides a way of discover¬\ning new ideas; it also uses a way of thinking which gives correct conclusions from\nthe evidence gathered; and it gives us a large body of organized knowledge\ngathered and tested by this method. Scientists have made discoveries by watching,\ntesting, experimenting, and measuring. The first and most famous of all scientific\nexperiments was performed by Galileo, an Italian born in the 16th Century. Super¬\nstitions are unscientific beliefs people use to explain things which they do not\nunderstand.\nThings to Do;\n1. Make a list of common superstititions. Put opposite them the scientific fact\nor truth.\n2. Read about famous scientific experiments performed by such people as Galileo,\nNewton, Pasteur, The Curies.\n3. Make a list or collect pictures of tools used by scientists.\nSources;\n1. Parker - \"The Scientist and His Tools\"\n2. Smith and Jones - En.ioying Modern Science\nProgram No. 2\nZERO\nThings to Remember:\n1. Heat is a form of energy.\n2. Temperature is a part of weather.\n3. A thermometer measures temperature.\nMan cannot control the weather, but he can prepare himself for it. Conditions\nin the atmosphere are the real weather makers. The temperature of the air is one\nof the important parts of the weather. It is not the same everywhere on earth,\nbecause different parts of the earth receive different amounts of radiant energy,\nor heat, from the sun. A thermometer is used to measure the temperature of the\nair...How hot it is. Two thermometer scales commonly used are the Fahrenheit\nand the centigrade scales. A recording thermometer is called a thermograph, and\nis one of the most important weather instruments.\n-3-"
