  "text": "In fairly random fashion> many of you have discussed with us projects for which\nwe need funds. It is our hope that for sccie (I really hope for jail) we can find\nsupport. This should involve a multiplicity of sources.\nWould you each, please, therefore, send a statement of the one (preferably)\nproject we should concentrate on in your area, with:\n—• a brief write-up we could copy with a minimum of rewriting (since\nwe have vii dually no staff to do this).\n— estimated budget needed.\nZ\npossible contacts (person, firm, address) and indication of whether you\ncould handle any or all of these contacts (or suggest who might), if\nauthorized by the NAEB so to proceed on its behalf?\nWould you please add also*\n— a statement of the area of emphasis you would suggest for the committee\nnext year, and possible redefinition of your conmittee's functions.\n— possible reorganizations of the committee (only if you feel this is\nindicated).\n— suggested new names for c omit tee members.\n— a reaction to a three-year rotation basis for committee membership,\nany other suggestions you may have for the improvement of our work.\nSince committees are the great strength of the NAEB, and have been the source of\nmany of our best new idees, we also want to thank you for the selfless efforts\nyou have already given. We hope our growing stature is a source of satisfaction\nto you, as it is to us.\nOne of the roles I see for the NAEB is to help its members achieve recognition,\nstature, realization and outlet for their ideas, ideals and work. We shall do\nour best to achieve that role. We should like to help our members get articles\npublished, and have them named to various distinguished conmissions, councils and\nboards. We wish to help all we can in such connections. 3h this, as in all other\ncases, your suggestions are most welcome."
