IOWA\nSeptember 2, 1952\nGraydon Ausraus, Director\nRadio-Broadcasting Services\nManager, WUOA (FM)\nUniversity of Alabama\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Graydon:\nMany thanks for your kind and thoughtful letters of August 25th.\nIt was particularly thoughtful of you to write Dr. Friley and I\ngenuinely appreciate your comments about the staff and the station.\nI will be very interested in hearing whatever develops with respect\nto the Committee and the executive director situation. I have been\ngiving this a lot of thought and the whole situation, for a matter\nof fact, and will have same ideas I would like to express to you on\nthe telephone or in writing sometime next week, on matters other than\nthe executive director.\nWhat it amounts to is this, I think our all-time high priority at\nMinneapolis is getting ourselves put together as a total unit so that\nno committees, sub-functions, headquarters, trips, plans and dreams\nare conceived in a matter which is unrelated to the basic activities\nof NAEB. Where this is the case they should be reintegrated with our\ngoing activity.\nThe foregoing sounds like a fine and beautiful speech but nonetheless\nI think it is very much to the point at the present time for a good\nmany reasons.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hull\nRadio-TV Director\nRBHsdm\nASC.tV\ncbs-Tv\nNBC -TV\nDUMONT - TV"
