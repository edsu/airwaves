Vogl\n- 2 -\nNovember 6, 1957\nI have noted during the past six years an increasing tendency for\nthe NAEB to become more and more a Midwestern social club for\nradio operators. I had hoped (and worked) for the organization\nto become a national center for leadership in education by broadÂ¬\ncasting. It has not, in my opinion, progressed. It has. In fact,\nretrogressed. Its present status is much worse than it was when\nSy Siegel left its presidency.\nUnless I can be convinced that the present reactionary tendencies\nin NAEB leadership can be reversed promptly, I shall have to do\nwithout NAEB. At present I will not regard this as a serious loss\nto me or to KTCA-TV.\nVery truly yours.\nJohn C. Schwarzwalder\nGeneral Manager\noc: Dr. Burton Paulu"
