ISSIOKER HENNOCK\nI agree with the majority that it is imperative that\na high standard of impartiality in the presentation of issues of\npublic controversy be maintained by broadcast licensees. I do not\nbelieve that the Commission’s decision, however, will bring about\nthe desired end. The standard of fairness as delineated in the\nReport is virtually impossible of enforcement by the Commission\nwith our present lack of policing methods and with the sanctions\ngiven us by law. We should not underestimate the difficulties\ninherent in the discovery of unfair presentation in any particu¬\nlar situation, or the problem presented by the fact that the sole\nsanction the Commission possesses is total deprivation of broadcast\nprivileges in a renewal or revocation proceeding which may occur\nlong after the violation.\nIn the absence of seme method of policing and enforcing\nthe requirement that the public trust granted a licensee be exer¬\ncised in an impartial manner, it seems foolhardy to permit editorial-\nization by licensees themselves. I believe that we should have such\na prohibition, unless we can substitute for it some more effective\nmethod of insuring fairness. There would be no inherent evil in\nthe presentation of a licensee’s viewpoint if fairness could be\nguaranteed. In the present circumstances, prohibiting it is our\nonly instrument for insuring the proper use of radio in the public\ninterest."
