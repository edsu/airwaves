I now have a\nbetter idea of the general problem. The immediate\nproblem is getting AFTRA to recognize the special\nposition of educational, non-commercial TV stations\nand give them special consideration as IBEW and\nIATSE are doing with the engineers.\nI have told them frankly that I didn* t want\nto get into this until I talked to you two guys and\nalso discussed it informally with George Heller,\nthe head of AFTRA. I made it very clear that I did\nnot want to do anything that would jeopardize NAEB.\nI have a feeling that because they have Ford support,\nit makes it harder to get concessions for them than\nfor an individual, non-commercial, educational TV\nstation. I*m not looking for new clients, but I\nrealize the importance of the Center to the developÂ¬\nment of the existing and future stations, nan you\nVP vmin __i _ . , _ J\nMSN:ck\ncc: Harry Skomia"
