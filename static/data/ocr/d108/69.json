Script\nNo. I has been rewritten and now recorded again, and in the mail\ntinder separate cover. I think the bibliography at the end will\nprove useful, and since I ran a little short of time, I ad-libbed\na sentence or two not in the script about these pamphlets being\nfree of change. I do think that the serious listener to the\nseries may find these of benefit. Also, the topical and perishable\nitem about the Osaka fair has been deleted and something else\nput in its place. The program runs 14:30 with perhaps 20 seconds\nadditional theme fill. The end-cues are the same: Tape recorded\neach week in Tokyo, REPORT FROM JAPAN is written and produced by\nJohn Lerch...(this is on the scripts of course. ) You might want\nto mimeograph these scripts and distribute with the tapes. You\nnow have six!\nFrom your letter of May 14 I see that you are sending six more\ntapes. Many thanks. This takes up the last I've got. Script VII\nis a long way off right now, but will be done after the first of\nJune. I'm leaving for Kyoto the 28th for six days and will get on\nto script VII and the recording thereof shortly after. Since\nSeptember is the release dafce, I now feel better about the whole\nseries, and will try to plan my topics and subjects accordingly.\nActually this gives me a little more leeway to plin interviews"
