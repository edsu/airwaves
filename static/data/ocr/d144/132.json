I believe you will agree that\na sound Public Relations program cannot be conducted by a committee. If\ncertain specific matters seem to need committee advice and assistance\n(e.g. the present work being done by Lee Campion and Marion Corwell on\na speakers guide), either ad hoc committees, or one or two individuals will\nbe asked to help out.\nX appreciate the very real service this committee has provided in the\nface of extreme administrative difficulties, and you may be sure that\nI will call upon you again.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley"
