This project was\nmade possible by a grant from the U. S. Office of Education under\nthe provisions of the national Defense Education Act, and will\nattempt to explore how people are affected by the medium itself as\nseparate from the message being transmitted by the particular medium.\nIn other words, we know pretty well how people react to the printed\nword and we have courses in teaching them to read properly and well,\nbut we do not know what effect the medium of television has upon\npeople, or how they will react differently to the same message over\ntelevision simply because that is the medium used* And any attempts\nat teaching people how to view TV properly are very limited and weak\nat best. It is very difficult adequately to explain this project in\na few sentences (especially when it took several pages of explanation\nin the proposal we submitted to the U. S. Office of Education), but\nI'm sure you get the idea.\nAt any rate, knowing of your interest in this sort of thing and\nfeeling that there might be considerable connection between your\nproposed studies and this project, I have taken the liberty of passing\nyour name an to Dr. McLuhan and suggesting that he get in touch with\nyou. I expect that you will hear from him sometime soon.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEH/dp\ncci Dr. Marshall McLuhan"
