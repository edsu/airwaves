Hull -2\nChairman, Combined NAEB Board\nMay 17, 1962\nwas being set up to benefit one individual and his station more than the others.\nBased on the discussion at the Board Meeting, I could not supply them with in¬\nformation that would really satisfy their questions.\nThe result of this discussion was, therefore, that this represents a major\nchange in the structure and operation of the NAEB and should be undertaken\nonly with majority or better support from the TV members. Failing in this under¬\ntaking, the Region I members have asked me to resign from the Board and each\nmember would then be free to review his own position viz-a-viz the Board\naction.\nI hope I have transmitted their wishes to you accurately. It may seem a\nsmall matter, but it seems to those of us here that this is based on the princi¬\nples of democracy which the association has so long heralded as setting it\nabove the other organizations in this field. We would hope that they wouldn*t\nbe so easily given away for the sake of doing what is expedient.\nWith best wishes.\nSincerely,\nHartford N. Gunn, Jr,\nGeneral Manager, WGBH\nHNGjrseh\ncc: Mr. William G. Harley\nMr. Raymond D. Hurlbert\nMr. Richard S. Burdick\nMr. Mike Colins\nMr. Donald E. Schein\nMr. Keith Nighbert"
