He’s\na sharp, shrewd la¬\nbor lieutenant, with\na deep passion for following his big\nchief's orders intelligently among the\nunion men in his bailiwick. Like any\ngood' district leader he knows the\nfirst names and foremost troubles of\nthe dues-payers in the shops through\nwhich he wanders every day.\nNow that he has been told to pick\nup a couple of bucks from each of\nhis men for the coming political fight\n—he’ll deliver. Like Big Bill Hutche¬\nson’s business agents, for example,\nwho’ve just been ordered to collect\n$2 apiece from some 600,000 A.F.L.\ncarpenters.\nNo Cheers.\nRIESEL.\nThey’ll get the money just for the\npolitical purge funds which Big Bill\nwill be spending this fall to drive\nfrom congress the men he thinks are\nhis enemies—for Big Bill sees himself\nand his union as one and the same.\nBig Bill has been petulantly balk¬\ning at playing ball with the A.F.L.’s\nnew political league—which I think\nhas the right to exist and campaign\nfor what it thinks right so long as it\ncollects money from its people on a\nvoluntary pasis. So the thought of\n\"Hutch” setting up an independent\npolitical division of the carpenters\nwith a slush fund of $1,200,000 which\nhe’ll run as iron handedly as he runs\nhis union isn’t provoking any cheers\nin labor circles.\nAnother Campaign.\n\"Hutch” is operating out of Indian¬\napolis, and if he arrogantly weren’t\nconvinced that those labor chiefs\nwho disagree with him are \"dumb”\n(his own word), he could learn some¬\nthing from his Midwest neighbors.\nOver in Cleveland, for example, the\nA.F.L. political strategists aren’t talk¬\ning in terms of a purge.\nThey want to get the vote out.\nMilk-wagon drivers there belong¬\ning to Labor’s Non-Partisan League\nare planning to tie “Register and\nVote” tags to every milk bottle de¬\nlivered in Cleveland.\nTo needle its people into activity\nthe Cleveland league already has dis¬\ntributed 267,000 pieces of literature\ntelling them to get busy and get out\nthe vote. To pay for this snowfall\nof pamphlets A.F.L. strategists called\non their business agents for a volun¬\ntary contribution of $52 apiece—just\nto show the rank and file that every¬\nbody’s money is good in this cam¬\npaign. It’ll set a good example for\nCleveland’s 150,000 A.F.L.ers — who\nby the way, are shrewd politicos.\nSome 90 per cent of the candidates\nthey endorsed last fall were '’ected.\nC.I.O. and Truman\nRespectfully and diplomatically — .\nand through the proper channels—\nthe C.I.O’s highest political strate¬\ngists are expected shortly to advise\nPresident Truman not to run for re-\nelection.\nThat’s the plan in C.I.O. political\ncircles today. The president will be\ntold, through some of his most fam¬\nous city and state Democratic lead¬\ners, that the labor vote cannot be\ngotten out for him.\nTo save his party from apparently\ncertain defeat, the labor chiefs will\nsay, Mr. Truman should “choose not\nto run” and make way for what the\nC.I.O. believes to be \"progressive”\ncandidates. The two men mentioned\nin C.I.O. offices in the past few days\nare Eisenhower and Supreme Court\nJustice Douglas—both of whom have\nso far refused to consider any. nom¬\ninations.\nC.I.O. Reasoning. V -\nThat’s today’s thinking in national\nC.I.O. quarters. November is still\nmany sweltering months away, j\nThere’s no predicting what the C.I.O.’s\nfar-stretched \"block-worker” action\ncommittees will do if Mr. Truman,\nas is expected, chooses to run.\nBut it can be accurately reported to¬\nday that the C.I.O. leaders, upon\nwhom the Democrats have been\ncounting for a door-ringing campaign\nin the congested industrial centers,\nwant Mr. Truman to refuse to head\nthe national ticket.\nWhy do the C.I.O. leaders believe\nthey can't sell Mr. Truman to the\nlabor, voters ?\nThe C.I'O., though supporting the\nMarshall Plan, believes that the presi¬\ndent’s foreign policy has been inept—\nwhich is the kindest of the adjectives\n1 heard.\nStupidity in Greece. ’*• s t^*\nThe labor men point, for example,\nto ••the time the Greek government\nstupidity made strikers liable to the\ndeath sentence in some casp's. To the\nutter consternation of the A.F.L. and\nC.I.O.. which support aid to Greece,\nthe White House didn’t snap back at\nAthens and tell the government off.\nWhite House people figuratively\nyawned—until they were needled into\nsending a memo.\nIn China, Chu Hsueh Fan, head of ;\nthe Chinese Federation of Labor, was\nexiled by Chiang. The White House j\ndid nothing although A.F.L. and C.I.O.\nleaders tried to get action as futilely\nas they tried to get it on Palestine.\nIf you’re a labor chief, those things\nare hard to explain to your people.\nAnd they’re typical incidents.\nBut all this doesn’t mean the C.I.O.\nhas split with the Democratic party.\nNot at all. There’ll be C.I.O. leaders\nfrom California to New York as dele¬\ngates to the' Democratic National\nConvention.\nBut this time, so far, they feel they\nhave no one to cheer in ’48.\nAnd now the C.I.O.’s Political Ac¬\ntion Committee is starting election\n\"block worker” schools to teach its\ncampaigners how to canvass door-to-\ndoor. First-such \"institutes’* will be\nheld shortly in Iowa and Minnesota.\nV * (Copyright, 1948.)"
