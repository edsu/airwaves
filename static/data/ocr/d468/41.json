That we regard as the birthright of this adoles¬\ncent country <>\nIs freedom from all restraints wholly good, Mr. Governor?\nIs ftPything wholly good, Mr. Tocqueville? I don8t know. I am sure it\nmust have its dark side; but I am equally sure -that this country wants\nit, end that this country has got it. It is a heritage as natural as\nthe air we breathe; whether it sweetenss the hard toil of New England\nor inflates the hot pride of the South; it8s always the same brave\nspirit, pervading the same republic. And its influence is not the less\npowerful because it is everywhere propagated by an animating spirit\nof dispute. You are taking notes, Mr. Tocqueville; and I8m glad to\nsee you do it. Now take a note of this: The American people, dispersed\nover an immense territory, abounding in all the means of commercial\ngreatness, who early found an opportunity of adapting their government\nto their circumstances ...\n...Of adapting their government to their circumstances\nThey followed the manifest order of nature when they adopted a consti¬\ntution which was free; a constitution which was republican; and a con¬\nstitution which was based on a commercial federation.\nBut, Mr. Governor «•*\nNo, sir. I will not comment on its desirability; except to say this:\nas we are concerned, it is infinitely desirable, because it was wholly\ninevitable. Will you forgive me if I speak for a moment of your own\ncountry; and speak to you privately, as a man?\nWe should be honoured."
