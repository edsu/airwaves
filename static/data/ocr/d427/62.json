Ill.\nDear Harry;\nLeonard has told m of his conversations with Jim Macandrew and others\nat the Columbus meeting in connection with the rates charged by the Post\nOffice Department for sound recordings and for films.\nBefore writing you our letter of October 13, 1953 (a copy of which is\nenclosed) we had a series of conferences with the Post Office Department\nin an effort to persuade them to reevaluate their interpretation of the\npostal regulations. Ko matter how strenuously we argued the point w©\nwere unable to make any headway.\nThe recommendation which I made in the next to the last paragraph of my\nOctober 13 latter to you is, I think, the only way we are going to be\nable to accomplish the result you desire. From the currant Administra¬\ntion8© drive to raise as much funds as possible from every conceivable\nsource, it is clear to me that the Post Office Department would not\nvoluntarily change its interpretation of the regulations.\nSincerely,\n/a/ Marcus\nMarcus Cohn\nEnclosure\ncc: Graydon Ausmus\nJames F. Maoandrew\ncopied 4/U/54vc"
