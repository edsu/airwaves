Arlotta\n1309 Dilston Road\nSilver Spring, Maryland\nDear Mr. Arlotta:\nUnfortunately I was away from Washington on business this\npast weekend, and therefore, was unable to attend the\nA&pha Kappa Psi banquet on April 11.\nI was very pleased to receive the announcement and would like\nto know more about the local Alum group. I wonder if you\nwould be kind enough to pass this on to whomever is in charge\nof the local mailing list. I was an Alpha Kappa Psi at the\nUniversity of Illinois in the class of 1940 and would be\ninterested in participating in the fraternity activities here\nin Washington if time permits.\nThank you.\nSincerely,\nHarold Â£. Hill\nmlm"
