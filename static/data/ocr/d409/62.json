Some of the chief functions of the center, those of expediting dis¬\ntribution; promoting wide use of many types of materials; encouraging individual\ninitiative in seeking out and securing new materials and ways of using them, may\nbe jeopardized if the center is primarily a depository and lending agency. Spe¬\ncialized materials peculiar to a specific department or ones used very frequently\nshould be stored in these departments. They should, however, be purchased and\ncataloged thru the center.\nRecommended space allocation for storage of materials: I4OO sq. ft. minimum\nfor the small college.

It is recommended that these tables be grounded and\nset on rubber floor mats. Recessed storage cabinets maybe built into the lower"
