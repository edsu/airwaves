I will be interested in your\nreactions.\nI approve of the idea of much consultation with Wells Foshay.\nNot only is he bright, he is quite enthused about your project. I\nspoke with him about it two or three months ago.\nGood luck with the job ahead. It is not going to be an easy one\nbut 1 am becoming more and more confident that some new and important\nideas are going to come out of it.\nBest,\nSamuel L.
