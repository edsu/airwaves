Harley,\nPresident National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters,\nDupont Circle Building,\nSuite 1119,\nWashington D.C.\nU.S.A.\nDear Mr. Harley,\n_ . 1 vividly remember the interesting talk we had in\nWashington some months ago, regarding a news—relay program from\nthe Netherlands to the United States, specifically for use bv\nNAEB stations.\nAs yop. undoubtedly know, much progress has been\nmade towards realizing this project with the support of station\nWUOM in Ann Arbor, Michigan and its manager, Mr. E.G. Burrows.\n^ ^ ^ w? h°Pe to start the entire program in the beginning\nof October. As it happens on the 10th of October our new studio-\nbuildingin Hilversum will be officially inaugurated. We feel\nthat it is of the greatest importance that one of the leading\npersonalities of NaEB attends the opening ceremonies personally.\nIt would be an honor and a very great pleasure if\nyou could accept our invitation to come to Hilversum yourself.\nThis invitation includes a round trip from the United States to\nthe Netherlands and a stay of about a week in Hilversum.\nMr. Burrows informs me in one of his letters that duties in\nconnection with the forthcoming national convention of NAEB during\nthe latter part of Octdber might make it impossible for you to\ncome to Europe personally. In this unfortunate case we kindly\nask you to suggest the name of a member of NAEB who could\nrepresent you and educational broadcasters collectively.\nWe very much hope to receive your affirmative\nreply as soon as possible.\nWERELDOMROEP\nJA/TG\nNAEB ME,' . : I '/■;\nSEP 6 1961\nt\nRespectfully lours,\nRADIO NEDERLAND WERELDOMROEP\nJ.W.
