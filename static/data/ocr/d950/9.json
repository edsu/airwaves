Becker, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\nDivision of Television-Radio-Film\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam,\nThank you for your thoughtful analysis of the current\nproblems of the research committee.\nRegarding the quotation from Cheydleur on the first page\nof your hectograph, you may recall that the specifics of what\nwill not be paid for are described in the rules that have been\ndistributed by Skornia.\nIt is a revision of these rules instead of the announcement\nof the grants that may be wanted.\nYou have my agreement that the money of a grant Should not\npay for the costs of publication, except in extremely unusual\ncircumstances.\nIt may be good to circulate announcement of grants to NAEB\ninstitutional members and NAEB individual members, as well as to\nacademic departments such as those of psychology, sociology, and\neducation.\nOf course our relations with other NAEB committees is a matter\nof policy and should be discussed with Harry or with Burton.\nBurton is teaching for us here until August 2 and he said that he\nis resigning his presency immediately in order to accept a Ford\ngrant for further study of European broadcasting during the\nacademic year beginning in September."
