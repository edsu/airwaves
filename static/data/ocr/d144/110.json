A convention and two other meetings have taken\nplace since Marion forwarded your letter to me. thus the\ndelay.\nOur Executive staff has given serious thought to this sugges¬\ntion and we feel that it simply is not feasible for the NAEB\n(even in cooperation with NET) to undertake such an exhibit.\nEven if the space were to be donated to us, there are still\nseveral other factors to be considered.\nIn the first place the Hall of Education and the communica¬\ntions \"show\" both leave somefektng to be desired, and it may\ndo us more harm than good to exhibit in either. Secondly,\nthere would be the cost of preparing a worthwhile exhibit\nwhich would run into $2,000. Thirdly, there is the problem\nof staffing the exhibit. We feel that no exhibit should be\nleft unattended and that no static exhibit does much for the\nexhibitor. We would not be in a position to provide someone\nto staff it nor to pay the cost of having it staffed.\nIt would indeed have been a fine idea to have a NAEB-NET\nexhibit in the Hall of Education ii all of the abovefectors\ndid not weigh so heavily against it.\nSincerely,\nHEH/mlm\ncc; Marion Corwell\nHarold E. Hill"
