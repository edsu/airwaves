Skomia\nDear Dick:\nThe more I thought over the letter to Nelson regarding our grant\nextension, the more difficult it became • 1 drafted one but am still\nholding-on the theory, as Bidlack puts it, of “letting sleeping\ndogs lie.** He knows of his promise, and my other letter, of yes¬\nterday, requires an answer.
