Got a man to help with the Fact Sheets which\nhad begun to accumulate* Among them was one on \"Radio Listening Patterns in a\nCanadian Cocaminity \"Before* Television** Attached is a copy,\nI think I was thrown off by its being a radio study, which wasn't the way I\nrecalled the one I intended to send you. It now appears that it's one and the\nsame. Mea Culpa!\nThanks very much for the Progress Report on the Case Institute Study. It's very\ninteresting. Fine job, old boy. Our sincere thanks. It should go out with\nseveral others next week.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skarnia\nExecutive Director\nHJS/dfc\nEnclosure"
