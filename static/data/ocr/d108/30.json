They did not in any way coma directly to us. Bob\narranged panels of ccqxxrts in various countries. Each panel discussed the\nhistory, educational situation, economics, women's status, or some other\nphase of its country.\nWe ran another oaries by Qrahtm Hovey, lately the HAEB-Fulbri^it Scholar to\nItaly. These qusrter^xjur programs consisted largely of political ooisasntaiy,\nthough not altogether. Other phases of the culture, fron art to bicycle\nracing and Lollotarigida, were also covered. A number of Interviews were\nobtained, including one with Renata Tebaldi, together with a special recording\nof her performance of a Puccini aria, not long before she left Italy for her\n>btropolitan debut. For the most part, those programs war© purposely not\ntimely because of the lapse of time between recording and distribution here\nin the States. It would be better if you stuck with less timely subjects\nin your rceorditigs for the same reason.\nDoes that cover it for now* dad to answer any further questions.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nJohn Holt\nIfetwork Manager\nJHijy\nces Br. harry J* Stoomia\nMr. Seymour H.
