In fact, it\nhas been said that our knowledge of the ocean today is about equal to the know¬\nledge men had about this continent at the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\nIt might be interesting to find out just how scanty that was.' But... compared\nto the Cambrian Age, even Louis and Clark look pretty progressive don’t they?\nAnd there will be more changes, because man makes many changes himself.\nScientists, however, get a great deal of satisfaction from solving\nproblems.. .and they are approaching the problems of the ocean in the same way\nthat they approach other problems. She gives a brief resume of the scientific\nmethod.\nTheir first problems, of course, had to do with survival under the\nwater. Teacher says that from observation of film and television, from\nreliable reading sources, from adult scientists, and from their own experiences,\nshe expects the pupils know what some of these problems were and how they have\nbeen solved. She feels sure that with the help of their classroom teacher they\ncan find out about others.\nAs we follow our scientists in their efforts to solve the problems of\nthis new environment, we find that the solution does not always lie in a brand\nnew invention or technique. Sometimes it’s simply a new way of using a\nfamiliar tool.\nTEACHER EXHIBITS THE PRESSURE COOKER. DESCRIBES HOW THE PARROT WAS\nCONVEYED SAFELY TO THE \"STARFISH\" AND THE DEEP DIVING TOWER. MIGHT SHOW PICTURE\nOF DIVERS CARRYING PRESSURE COOKERS.\nShe says that the exploration for new facts to support new hypotheses\nsometimes shows an earlier hypothesis to have been wrong."
