I could not disagree with John more. I think\nTHAT YOUR LETTER DOES TAKE THE ONLY POSITION THAT THE\nNAEB CAN TAKE REGARDING CONTINENTAL CLASSROOM. I, FOR\nONE, THINK IT IS FOOLISH TO WASTE THE NAEB’s LIMITED FUNDS\nTO CALL A SPECIAL MEETING AT THIS TIME.\nI HAVE NOT SENT A COPY OF THIS LETTER TO SCHWARZWALDER\nFOR FEAR IT WOULD MERELY ADD FUEL TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE\nA BRIGHTLY BURNING FIRE. HOWEVER, IF YOU WISH TO UTILIZE\nTHE ABOVE PARAGRAPH IN ANSWERING HIM, PLEASE FEEL FREE\nTO DO SO.\nI AM ATTACHING THE LATEST COMMUNICATION FROM FRANK\nKear. It doesn‘t say very much, but at least indicates\nHE IS WORKING ON THE PROBLEM. I WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED.\nSINCERELY\nDI RECTOR\nWBAA Radio - TV Unit\nJSM: vml\nEnclosure 1"
