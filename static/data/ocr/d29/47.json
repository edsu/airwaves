This Is a social question which arises\nto-day in Africa, and India, and China. Because, whether\nthey receive all the media at once, or whether they get one-\nat-a-time, may have quite drastic effects on their develop¬\nment and on their relation to one another.\nPrint has great power to detrlbalize a society, but it\nalso creates intense Individualism and nationalism. Radio,\non the contrary, in Africa intensifies the existing tribal\npatterns. It is only the print bias of our own training which\nleads to suppose that the program \"content\" of radio broad¬\ncasts In Africa are the cause of the ensuing emotions."
