Skornia *\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1*+ Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Skornia:\nPortage High School is considering the purchase of a 10-\nwatt FM transmitter and other necessary equipment to begin\noperation as an educational station in this area. Before such\na step can be taken however, I must present to our school\nboard some figures on initial cost and on operational costs.\nAlso, of course, the board would like to know something about\nthe programming and what needs such an educational station\nwould fulfill.\nWestern Michigan College, with an extensive FM operation\nis nearby, and Wallace Garneau the station manager is very\nhelpful, but their programming, schedule and budget are all\non a college level.\nI am very much interested in programming and if you have\nany extra copies of program schedules of ten watt FM stations,\nI would appreciate any that might? be available to me. Also it\nwould be extremely helpful to me if you could suggest a good\ntransmitter and its cost, along with the other basic equipment\nwe would need to get under way.\nDo you know whether, in educational stations, student\nhelp is used entirely as far as engineers and announcers are\nconcerned? What FCC license is required for a ten watt\noperation? What part of your school budget does the oper¬\nation of your station fall under? As you well know these are\nbut a few of the questions I will have to answer for our own\npecular situation before we here at Portage can progress\nbeyond the embryo stage in our “Operations Radio.\"\nI know your own personal schedule must keep you very busy,\nso any help or suggestions that you might forward to me will\nbe doubly appreciated, and I would like to thank you in ad¬\nvance for such aid.\nCordially yours,\nA/\nHarry Wl\n'lklow"
