Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nEnclosed is a copy of the pilot Issue of Educational Radlo-XV . Just\npublish&d by die NAEB.\nLast April, our Board of Directors, realising that there is a real need\nfor a magazine of this sort, (a need not being filled by any other\nperiodical ), authorised the staff to proceed with the publication of\na pilot issue. It was realized at the time that such a magazine would\ncost a considerable amount of money, but we felt that, if we did not\nfill this void in the educational broadcasting field, someone with\npurely commercial interests might well do so. This magazine, as you\ncan see, is intended to serve a function that neither our more scholar¬\nly loumai nor our ' 'family-house-organ' * Newsletter can hope to\nprovide. The advertising space in this pilot issue was sold for some¬\nthing less than actual cost, simply to have an issue that would reflect\nwhat we have in mind for such a publication if we can establish it cm\na permanent basis.\nWe sincerely believe that such a magazine Is the next logical step\nin orderly improvement of our publication program, which has been\npossible during the past two years thanks to the funds provided for\nthis purpose by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. The $10,000 which has\nbeen earmarked annually in the Kellogg grant for publications has\npermitted its to hire a full-time editor, upgrade the quality of the\nJournal, and make complimentary copies available to educational\nleaders throughout the nation."
