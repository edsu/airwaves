Studies of the effect and\nuses of writing, and of the habits of readers, are almost\ntotally lacking for all periods, including the modem.\nThe reason seems to be inherent in the nature of\nprinting in particular. For print not only fosteins the illu¬\nsion of the neutrality of all media (via its pattern of\nstatic is it shots) but makes a theory of change difficult\nif not impossible.\n(a) The manuscript was read aloud both in the an\nancient world, and in the Middle Ages.\nSilent reading was regarded as an almost\nimpossible stunt until printing. The conse¬\nquence of such reading for living and\nlearning, writing and reading, were very great."
