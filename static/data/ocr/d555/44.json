  "text": "AS OTHERS READ US: AMERICAN FICTION ABROAD\nis a series of eight one-hour taped radio programs. After an introductory\nprogram in which the theme of the series is keynoted by Robert Penn War¬\nren and Claude-Edmonde Magny, each of the seven programs that follow\nis devoted to the art—and its European reputation—of a major American\nnovelist of this century. Each of the seven novelists is discussed, in informal\ncolloquy, by two critics of note—one representing an American view, the\nother a European view. In all, sixteen critics participate in the discussions.\nThree of the programs bring the voices of the writers themselves: John\nDos Passos, John Steinbeck and William Faulkner read from their books,\nthe first two joining the critics in discussion. On the programs dealing with\nHenry James, Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway, passages from their\nbooks are dramatized.\nEach program runs from 59 to 59^ minutes."
