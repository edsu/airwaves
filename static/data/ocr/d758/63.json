(He had suggested it for the PR committee\nalso, and Bromo thought it was too early, that\nsome of the committee members would not be there\nyet. How do you feel about the time?)\nI haven't seen a program; so am really working\nin the dark as far as any other possibilities\nare concerned—such as, say, another breakfast\nmeeting as in San Francisco.\nIf Wed. a.m. seems o.k. with you, let's set it\nfor 10 o'clock and I'll write Wallach re a\nmeeting room. Will you notify the committee\nmembers, or do you want me to?\nAs far as I'm concerned, we need the meeting, be^\ncause Harley and Hill have me even now investi¬\ngating the possibilities and costs of a 32-page\nmonthly Newsletter, keeping the journal but as\na quarterly. I don't think there's that much to\nbe said each month about the field that isn't\nalready printed somewhere else...but then maybe\nthat's a negativistic attitude.\nThanks,"
