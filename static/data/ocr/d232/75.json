This would be a slight change from what John has suggested?\nit seems to sis. though, that if the Goimiiissien is willing to extend the time a station\nhas to complete construction, m should follow this decision on the assumption that\nif they extend the tii$e2 they must have a good reason. But certainly once a construe-*\ntion permit is cancelled by the Commission or surrendered by the license©* the insti¬\ntution should not b® continued as an aetiv© raaaber*\n(a) With the qualification implied by my (l) above I would go along with John\nan his (2) also."
