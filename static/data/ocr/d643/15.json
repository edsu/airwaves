Somedays\nseems that way to me. This is third Paulu note today.\nJust talked with Maurice Seay. He’s real busy, and would\nrather not talk right now. However, he wants Skornia and\nSchooley to visit him in early April; you, too, if you\nwish. 1 thought it better not to press him now, and he\nagreed he’d rather not be pressed. I offered to go along\nas valet, and he wanted to know how much money I had.\n■ihen I suggested Foundation pay, he said, ’’you’ve Just\nbeen turned down.\" I told him I was used to that and he\nhad good laugh. Thanked me for calling, and asked me to\ninitiate meeting. That’s this item.\nRegards,\nFrank E. Schooley\nF£S:hb\nCC: Skornia"
