C.\nDear Mr. Harley:\nI have your letter of March 15, 1962 with regard\nto the so-called Griffin amendment to the educational tele¬\nvision legislation (H. R. 132).\nI agree with you that the kind of activity engaged\nin by educational television community organizations should\nbe encouraged and that the legislation should not disqualify\nsuch organizations from receiving grants. It is my hope\nthat something can be worked out in conference to assure that\nsuch organizations will be entitled to Federal grants.\n?lWlWl12ll|%3|4,{|5\ni"
