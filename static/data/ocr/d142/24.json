Can you give me the final word\non this?\nIf there are lli programs in the series, by the way, the figures I sent you yes¬\nterday are slightly off. The total charge for all the currently-being-processed\nin-school programs is $176 at $2.00 per reel. This hardly changes the per pro¬\ngrams costs. The figures given were not 100# accurate, but they were quite close.\nI*ra sorry I won*t be able to be at the Regional meeting — especially after having\nenjoyed the last one I attended so much and after having repeatedly said that I\nthought it was perhaps even more important that I go to more Regionals than to\nNationals. But that*s the day before I get married. Well, one way or another, 1*11\nget a change of pace, I guess!\nSincerely,\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager\nJHtcr"
