(In St. Louis VISITONS MIMI can be heard at\nfive' different times'-within the weekly schedule.)\nThis arrangement of broadcasting the same program for two weeks per¬\nmits pupils to hear the lesson at least twice; it results in better\nlearning and reduces the burden of drill for the classroom teacher.\nUsed as recommended, the series of fourteen programs covers the entire\nyear of instruction. A Christmas program is included as an extra\nbetween lessons VI and VII; it can, however, be used elsewhere if con¬\nvenient or be omitted entirely.\nPrograms in this series are each ll*:30 minutes in length, exclusive of\nthe opening and closing KSLH announcements*\nOpening cue: This is KSLH, your school station in St* Louis,\nClosing cue: VISITONS MIMI originates in the studios of KSLH, the\nBoard of Education station in St. Louis,\nIn St. Louis we plan to make the following live announcement after\ncertain programs.\nLive announcement:\nAnd now may I remind the teachers who are using\nthis series that each program is being broadcast\nfor two consecutive weeks.\nPlease let us know your reactions to this experi¬\nment*"
