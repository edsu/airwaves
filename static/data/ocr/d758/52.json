I\ntried to make it a plea to teachers to embrace teaching machines for\nwhat they could do to make the teachers* tasks easier and their services\nmore effective. When I cautioned educators about \"extravagant claims**\nI was trying to warn them that they should study carefully what a given\nmachine could do, rather than to deoend solely upon advertising material\nor the claims of salesmen. If you will read again the balance of the\nthird paragraph of my editorial, you will see that it ends on an optimistic\nnote.\nI have no doubt but what responsible manufacturers such as your\nown will present no problem to the educator. They realise that their\nbest hopes for the future will result from a well-built machine which\nhas been programmed by competent curriculum specialists. Successful\nexperience with such machines will ensure growth in the usÂ® of these\nmachines as other educators learn of the experience of early users.\nThanking you again for your comments, I am.\nSincerely,\ncc Mr. Harold E. Hill\n/Mr. William G. Harley\nMrs. Betty McKenzie"
