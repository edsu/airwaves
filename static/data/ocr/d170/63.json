X\nKellogg Foundation.\nGame&u had earlier called ms on this to see if 1 thought this would\nin any wsy endanger the HASBss relations or status with Kellogg, Since it\nwas a Battle Greek station that was involved., and since this was the first\nbroadcast problem in which Dr, Sesy (in the absence of Bob VanBuyn)» person-\nally- became interested, I told Wallace that Pm sure we wouldn't want* to hold\nhim up.\nIn mj meeting with Dr, Sesy, I expressed our pleasure at their support\nuo the ment of some f??£00, of this MEB member station,\n, 7) Chicago2 Last stop on the four-dey trip was the Conrad-Hilton Hotel\nwhere, by previous appointment, 1 spent a few hours with G.

However, the desirability of a statement of\nohe lung term rises! needs and plans of the EASE combining in a single picture\nour entire budget, regardless of' source, appears important* 1 hopefwith the\nhelp of Frank Schooley and Harold Hill, to have this readv for you at the time\nof the Directors5 Meetings in Hew York,\nIn a general wsy, I reiterated the general sort of statements I had ear-\nlx©*, mace in the coismeni/S on the Calkins questions which you earlier received.\nI should like to state that I have never left a meeting with Mr. Griffiths\nwithout feeling that a warm rapport exists.
