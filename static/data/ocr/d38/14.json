For, he contends, the contra¬\ndiction between the promise of Soviet propaganda and the realities of Soviet\nlife is the greatest weakness of the regime's efforts to obtain the allegiance\nand support of its population.\nProfessor Inkeles notes that the amazing repetitiveness of Soviet mass\ncommunication strongly suggests that the Russian leaders have little faith\nin the extent to which the people have adopted the maxims put before them.\nAfter more than thirty years of Soviet rule, Professor Inkeles emphasizes,\nthe Communist Party finds that it still cannot relax its extraordinary con¬\ntrols over mass communication, but must, in fact, intensify them.\n* * * * 30 >:< sjc"
