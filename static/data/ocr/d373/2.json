It's a station that is in the movement with intelligence,\nforesight and real follow-through ability.\nCONTACT: Edward L. Morris, Director of Programming\n* * ❖ *\nKOED, San Francisco has whomped into the middle of what its all about\nwith\"BLACKS, BLUES, BLACK!\" a ten week color series featuring Maya Angelou\nof Ghana.\nLet me take a stab at that provocative title. In going back to the roots of\nthe American Negro, the program searches the African heritage, or the heritage\nof the \"Blacks. \" The period of slavery (including intellectual slavery of the 20th\nCentury) found expression in the \"Blues\" a medium of expression that recorded\na peoples' history and served as a steam valve. \"Black!\" (and note that excla¬\nmation point) says the beauty, power, in fact the whole summed-up-significance\nof Black America's new identity. The three words then, \"BLACKS, BLUES,\nBLACK!\" offer an historical and anthropological survey of Blackness.\nMiss Angelou, a citizen of the U. S. and a resident of Ghana is a singer,\ndancer, actress, reporter and playwright. In the series, Miss Angelou develops\nand demonstrates the history, heritage and habits of Blacks and how their mores\nand values have been preserved and assimilated into the society.\nMade possible by a public service grant from the Olympia Brewing\nCompany of Tumwater, Washington, the series made its debut to warm viewer\nreception on July 8th."
