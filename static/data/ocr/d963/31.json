These pressures have been felt inÂ¬\ncreasingly by the NAJEB and its rapidly growing membership. The present request is\nresponsive to those pressures and the needs of education today.\nThis proposal is for funds to provide for the development of services to teachers and\nadministrators of the U.S., in educational uses of television and radio for education, rather\nthan in broadcasting as such. A central source of guidance and information in the uses and\nevaluation of these media is needed if the broad interests of eduction, rather than only\nthose of television and radio, are to be served.\nThrough these services teachers* colleges as well as universities and colleges generally\nwould be encouraged and assisted to develop the type of workshops, courses and training\nnecessary to meet wholly new problems of education and curriculum revision in an\nelectronic age. Adult education, now too often patterned on school-room practices designed\nfor children, would also be an important area of emphasis.\nFor this post, as for others requested, a recognised specialist,not necessarily a\nbroadcaster, will be employed one qualified to earn and command the respect of educators\nAnnual Budget, on time-year basis:\nSalary - Coordinator\nSalaries - Secretarial\nTravel\nSeminars and workshops\nReports\nSupplies and Expenses\n$16,500\n4,400\n3,300\n12,000\n5,000\n.i*m\n$43,900"
