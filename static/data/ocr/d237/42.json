Both expressed interest in securing\npersons ofâ€™outstanding ability in television fn-ogramming and productaon\nto add to their faculties next fall. These jobs will pay_five to six\nthousand a year* The job in Birmingham will be an over-all program\ndirector for the system who will have perhaps two people or more work-\ning in production under him. The Bessemer job will be the full res\npossibility of one man. In both cases programs will involve primarily\npublic schools but in part also general aault programming.\nNeither place will have their own studios but will make use of the\ncommercial studios in Birmingham for at least a year.
