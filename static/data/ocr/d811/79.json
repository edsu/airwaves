The NASB\nRadio Network now distributes nine hours of regular programming a week to 79\nNASB member stations, and, in addition, distributes several series of in¬\nschool programs .each year to those stations broadcasting such programs. The\nper hour cost ©^Network programming to member stations is very small. Sta¬\ntions pay a Newark fee based on their transmitter power, ranging from $300\nto $800 annually. This means that, for stations taking all of the regular\nprograms offered by the Network, the cost per hour of programming ranges from\n6?^ to $1.75. There are other statistics about the total number of programs\ndistributed since 1951, total air time in hours, etc., which you are probably\nnot interested in. However, if you do feel this information would be helpful,\nplease let me know and 1*11 send you the tables and charts.\nSince last spring the NAEB has held 3 Regional meetings, supported in part\nby Foundation funds. This brings the total of such meetings held since 1951\nto 19.\nWe are \"re-gathering” the materials we assembled for you last spring and\nshould be able to send them to you within a few days. However, I believe\nyou still have the pictures we sent you from station KETC, St. Louis, and\nfrom the Chicago Board of Education. At least our records so indicate. If\nyou don* t have them perhaps they became lost in the mail. If a perusal of\nthe annual report I'm enclosing raises any questions in your mind, or gives\nyou leads for more information for the report, please let me know and I'll\nbe glad to supply whatever additional information you want.\nSincerely,\nHarold E.
