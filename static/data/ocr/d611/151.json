The drawing boards\nare busy at the moment with a planned series (1/2 hour weekly) which\nwill address itself to basic questions:\nHow do I interview for a job?\nWhat is a curriculum vitae and how do I put it\ntogether?\nWhom do I approach for a job?\nHow do I learn about jobs in the first place\nthat are right for me?\nWhat do I look for in trying to find a house?\nHow can I finance the purchase of a home?\nHow do I shop economically?\nWhere can I find general consumer education\nmaterials?\nWBAA is working with the local Human Relations Council on this\nproject and it is hoped that some of the very talented and vocal\nBlack students at Purdue can be encouraged to participate.\nNext summer, the station anticipates launching a series of\nradio workshops for junior and senior high school students in which\nbasic radio skills will be taught with an emphasis given on on-air\nproduction experience.\nCONTACT: John R.
