CHIEF CLERK\nMarch 3, 1967\nMrs. Marjorie Newman\nProgram Director, WFSU-FM\nUniversity Broadcasting Services\nThe Florida State University\nTallahassee, Florida 32306\nDear Mrs. Newman:\nThank you for your letter of February 22 in support of legislation\nto renew the ETV Facilities Act. I was sorry to hear that you were\nunable to attend the recent meeting of the Board of Directors of\nNational Educational Radio here in Washington due to your broken\nleg.\nI am enclosing a copy of the President’s Message to Congress\nentitled \"Health and Education\" which sets forth his recommenda¬\ntions on educational television and radio along with a copy of\nS. 1160, Public Television Act of 1967, which was introduced by\nSenator Magnuson on March 2. Briefly, this bill provides:.\n(l) extend and improve the program of grants for construction of\nnoncommercial educational radio broadcasting facilities; (2) establish\nand finance a nonprofit corporation to assist program operations in\nnoncommercial educational television and radio; and (3) to authorize\na study of instructional television and its relationship to educa¬\ntional television.\nI am in general accord with your thinking on this matter and am\nhopeful that the bill will be reported by the Committee on Com¬\nmerce in such form that I can support it. The Committee advises\nthat no hearings have yet been scheduled,'however, I shall follow\ndevelopments closely, keeping your interest in mind.\nWith best wishes\nI remain\nSLH/z\nEnclosures\nL. HOLLAND"
