I think it is clear enough, though, for all of us to agree\nthat there is no easy way for ideas to be absorbed.\nTo put it another way, then, the process of learning, more often than not, is\na painful one. On the part of the broadcaster who must maintain mass circulation\nif he is to sell his time, the very thought of presenting any program which connotes\npain, which involves the exhausting process of groping mentally after ideas, is\nabsolute heresy. And right there, perhaps, is the chief reason for the paucity of\nideas in broadcasting.\nI recall, not so long ago, when Miss Barbara Ward, who was a member of the\nBoard of Governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation, was discussing American\nradio. She mentioned that one of the striking things about this century in our country,\nis that we are embarking upon one of the most startling experiments mankind has ever\nmade. She was referring to the experiment of quite simply basing government not on a\nsingle group .. not on those who have the most talent and the best education .. but\nupon everybody.\nMass democracy is trying to draw everyone into the process of government. In\nthe past, government has always depended on those who had the education, the time,\nthe leisure to study the situation and be informed ... competent to make a balanced\njudgment. This was considered not to be within the reach of those who had to earn\ntheir daily bread by the sweat of their brow.\nNow we are taking a whole people into the process of government. We are\ncreating a mass democracy."
