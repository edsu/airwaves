  "text": "EQUIPMENT\n5A FREQUENCY AND MODULATION MONITOR\nFOR FM — Gives continuous indication of transmitter\ncenter frequency error; shows level of transmitter modu¬\nlation up to 140%; has a light that flashes when a\nselected level of modulation is exceeded.\n2A PHASE MONITOR - Measures phase and ampli¬\ntude relations of the currents in the antenna elements\nof a directional array so that these relations can be\ncorrelated with the field pattern.\nTRANSMITTER CONTROL DESKS - For 5 KW and 50\nKW AM Transmitters. Contain volume indicator panel,\nmonitoring amplifier, meter panel, line and announce\ncontrol panel and power switch panels for controlling\ntransmitter circuits.\n124E MONITOR AMPLIFIER — For monitoring AM and\nFM programs in transmitter buildings and studios. De¬\nsigned for relay rack mounting. Has a gain control\nand power switch mounted on the face mat.\n106A LINE AMPLIFIER — For raising the level of pro¬\ngrams coming into a transmitter building from the\nprogram lines.\n1126C PROGRAM OPERATED LEVEL GOVERNING\nAMPLIFIER — Reduces excessive peaks and protects\nagainst over-modulation in AM transmission. Prevents\nover-swing in FM, which may cause distortion in the\nreceiver and the guard band to be overridden.\n106A LINE AMPLIFIER\n1126C PROGRAM OPERATED LEVEL GOVERNING AMPLIFIER\n61"
