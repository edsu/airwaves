VJhile young David Reynolds\nwas leaning against* luxuriating* you might say, in its bountiful shade,\nhe racked his little brains to try and devisa some means of procuring\nfor the sustenance of his childish needs, a livlihood that should be both\nhonest and honourable. While he was thus reflecting how to get his\ndinner, a gentleman came up to him....\nName?\nI beg your pardon, sir? (COURTEOUSLY)\nI wondered if you knew this gentleman® s name.\nThis gentleman® s name, sir, has not been handed down to posterity.\nMay I proceed?\nPrey do.\nThank you, sir. A gentleman, whose name has hot been transmitted to\nus, approached this poor friendless boy, and asked if hetwere willing\nto carry the gentleman*s trunk down to the wharf. The boy eagerly\nconsented; and received for Ills labours the sum of twenty five cents.\nNow what do you suppose he did with it?\nSpent it on food.\nPerhaps he reserved some to pey for his night’s lodging; or was he\nprepared to sleep in the street?\nHe was prepared to do anything, sir, providing it was honest. 1*11 tell\nREX:"
