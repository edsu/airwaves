There has been some revived\ninterest in my reporting from Europe, and I wanted to ask\nyou if you would tell me whether Dr Milton Meyer's VOICES\nof EUROPE has met with any success this past year. I recall\nfrom listening to two or three of his programs that he had\nany entirely different approach, and an entirely different\nmethod of operation, but the ideas are still somewhat comparable\nI should also appreciate it, if you would send me a folder\nthat outlines his itinerary: where he has been and gives some\ncontent of the tapes. Any light you can shed on the reception\nto his program, and what you think mine, if launched through\nsmall commercial stations would be likely to get, will be\nvery welcome.\nSome week end, I may hop down to Urbana and\nsee what you're up toj Please give mtf kindest regards to\nDr. Skornia. '\nordialIy yours.\nH Lerch\nWould you kindly abcfress me at home: 404 Laurel\nAvenue, WiImette\nMr. John Holt\nNAEB Tape Network\nUniversity of Illinois\nGregory Hall,\nUrbana, 11 Iinois"
