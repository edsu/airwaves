Dreyfus\nAssistant Director\nRadio and Television\ntfeyne State University\nDetroit 2, MLchigan\nDear Lees\nReference is made to your letter of May 26 in which you request\ninformation regarding the payment for the kinescope made in\nconnection with the MeLuhen project.\nActually, I suspect that this problem has already been solved,\nand that the Detroit Educational Television Foundation has\nalready received the check. However, in order to avoid any\nfurther complications, I will attempt to explain what has hapÂ¬\npened.\nApparently the cheek that we issued in payment of this bill\noriginally (and this was done shortly after the presentation\nof the bill) was somehow lost, either in the mail or after it\narrived In Detroit. We were able eventually to determine this\nwas the case, and we have stopped payment on that original\ncheck and have issued a new one in its place. It is this new\ncheck which should have by now arrived in Detroit,\nI think this probably clears up the entire matter, but if there\nis still any question, or if the cheek has not arrived, please\nlet me know and we will continue to work on this problem.\nIncidentally, I appreciate your kind offer for Vtetyne State to\nunderwrite this expense if it became absolutely necessary.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nHEHskl$\nDictated but\nnot signed"
