Schooley\nStation WILL-AM-FM-TV\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Franks\nAgain I am indebted to you for your help and hospitality. And again I was\nimpressed with your lovely family—from Frank down to Jean Brown. Thank you\n(and Eleanor) for everything. Coming down now to more mundane matters:\n(1) I appreciate immensely the trouble you, Harry and Harold took with\nMarguerite on Friday morning. The convention outline should facilitate working\nup the St, Louis meeting, although I guess that headquarters (with whatever help\nyou can provide too) will have to do a good deal of the work. I stand ready to\nhelp if required, although too many cooks are apt to spoil the broth here as\notherwise, so I’ll not get into the act unless Harry — (or Marguerite too, of\ncourse) — or whoever else he wants to bear the major brunt of this, asks me.\n(2) I’m not quite clear on the television management seminar. Should we\ngo ahead without an okay from Ford to spend the funds that way, or wait for you\nto clear it with them?\n(3) I misplaced a thin, black barrel, Waterman ball point pen somewhere in\nChampaign. If you find it lying around, would you mail it to me?\nGood luck in your talks with the Ford folks. VJe all await the outcome.\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu,\nPresident\nBP sit\nCCs Harry J. Skornia"
