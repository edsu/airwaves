The response\nto our St. Margaret\nMary Novena was\nexceptionally good\non the part of our\nreaders, listeners,\nthe press and radio\nstations. In thus\npromoting devotion\nto St. Margaret Mary, I am sure we\nhelped increase devotion immensely to\nthe Sacred Heart of Jesus. Your financial\nsupport was excellent and, in a practical\nway, showed a deep concern for the\nproblem that confronts us with the ad¬\nvent of Sacred Heart-TV. Thefe were\ntwo sponsors who donated $100.00 each\nand several fifty and twenty-five dollar\ndonations. Others for the most part do¬\nnated one dollar or more, with a generous\nnumber of five and ten dollar offerings.\nWith TV alone costing this office $300.00\na week, you can see why we appreciate\nyour Auxiliary and Sustaining member¬\nships and your novena offerings.\nThank you kindly—A Happy Christ¬\nmas!\nFather Joseph Connolly, S.J.,\nAssociate Director.\nTV STATIONS PRAISE OUR\nSACRED HEART PROGRAM\n“Technical quality excellent; content ex¬\ncellent.”\nWm.

CLUB\nMrs. Antoinette Eno Del Vecchio Organizes\nThrifty Club to Promote Sacred Heart-TV.\nTonie\nMrs. Antoinette Eno Del Vecchio (Tonie) our tireless Sacred\nHeart promoter, is determined that Sacred Heart TV must not fall\nby the wayside because of lack of funds. To this end, she has set\nup two boards in her club under the title of, St. Margaret Mary TV-\nClub. Each board is measured to the means of donors. The first\nTonie has entitled “The Thrifty Club” whose members make a life¬\ntime membership donation of $50.00. Already four have signed up\nfor this club: Mr. John Heffernan, President of Gold Medal Beauty\nSupply Company, Boston; Miss Rita Flaherty, private secretary to\nDr. W. Brickley; Mrs. Marguerite McDermott, Bell Telephone\nsupervisor; Mrs. Mae Stevens, housewife.\nThe second Club Tonie has entitled “The Monthly Club.” These\njoin as auxiliary members and donate monthly $1.00, $2.00 or $5.00\naccording to their means.\nTo date the totals for both clubs amount to $275.25.\nPhoto—Jim Phelan\nMr. John Heffernan, first life-time donor of the St. Margaret Mary TV Club as a “thrifty” member,\n;presents Fr.

Walsh, Worcester, Mass.\nFROM ARCTIC CIRCLE!\nDear Father:\nThank you for your Sacred Heart\nrecords which arrived safely. The used\nones were mailed back. We are grateful\nfor the inspiration the program provided\nthroughout the past year.\nWe enclose a check for $50 from the\nCatholic men at Sondrestrom, a modest\ndonation, but this is a very small base.\nWe are sending some publicity which\nyou may care to use, pictures and a story\nabout the Sacred Heart Program at Son¬\ndrestrom, Greenland.\nSincerely,\n(Rev.)

More and more I\nfind that in my medical work I have to\nplay the part of a priest. Many patients\nthat I see suffer from mental and emo¬\ntional ailments and need spiritual guid¬\nance. Many of the talks that I have lis¬\ntened to on The Sacred Heart Program\nhave been a great help to me in this\nwork. I am particularly anxious to get\nthe talks, including the following series:\n“I was Sick and You Visited Me.” The\nSeries of talks on “Happy Family Liv¬\ning” and the Series of talks on “The Ser¬\nmon On the Mount” that were given\nsome two months ago.\nEnclosed, please find small contribu¬\ntion.\nDr. ......."
