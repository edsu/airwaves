  "text": "Visible\n52\nThe Learning Lens: VII\nmembers released for full-time\nparticipation in program series of\nlocal etv stations or educational\ntelecasts over commercial channels.\nThe grants gave to general-audi¬\nence etv the talents of scholars like\nlaw professor Zechariah Chafee,\nphysicist Harold Urey, and seman-\nticist I. A. Richards.\nA college professor who devotes\ntime and effort to etv often does so\nat the expense of publication and\nother traditional activities more\ncertain to move him up the aca¬\ndemic ladder. By 1959, etv stations\nwere more firmly established, and\nfaculty members throughout the\ncountry were taking fuller advan¬\ntage of educational programming.\nAccordingly, the Foundation shift¬\ned the emphasis of the grants to\nsupporting college-faculty partici¬\npation in etv teaching for aca¬\ndemic credit."
