The film dem¬\nonstrates many of the same general principles of utilization illustrated\nin the films: \"A Case Study in the Elementary School\" and \"Role of the\nClassroom Teacher.\" However, its special purpose is to consider the\naspects of utilization involved in the regimented time schedule and the\nspecialized subjectareas of the secondary school, when the same class¬\nroom teacher is not with the students for the major part of the school\nday, and to emphasize utilization procedures most appropriate to the\nstudents' increasing capacity for self-directed learning.\nFilm Synopsis\nThe viewer isgiven brief examples of classroom preparation for\ntelevision lessons in several subject areas at various grade levels, and\nbrief samples of \"follow-through\" activities related to other lessons in\nother subject areas at various levels of instruction. Major emphasis in\nthisfilm is upon the full spectrum oflearning experiences into which an\nimaginative teacher might guide the members of a high school English\nclass, using as a springboard a provocative television lesson on the far-\nreaching implications of investigation.\nG-3"
