They did a number of experiments in which they showed difib rent\ntypes of films to groups of children and, using infra-red light, photographed\ntlie reactions of the children, without their knowledge, as they watched the\ndifferent gifts. This work was discussed at our seminar on children's proÂ¬\ngrams in Boston last year, and her receipt of a copy of the report of that\nseminar occasioned her letter to me.\nTou will notice that she anticipates using the sam technique in connection\nwith television and will probably start her experiments early next year.\nThere might be something of value in this for your project, and we thought\nyou might want to get in touch with her. I will write her a letter so that\nshe will not be surprised to hear from you.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHi JO\nEnclosures"
