Ward Greenwood\nDirector, Adult Programming\nRadio Station KUOM\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis 14, Minnesota\nDear Mrs* Greenwood*\n1 am very grateful to you for your note of December 7*\nI am terribly sorry that the Herald Tribune Forum tapes did\nnot reach you so on enough so that they would not be dated*\nI understand exactly what your reason is, and I am frankly\ncurious to know what Mr* Burrows * reaction will be at the\nUniversity of Michigan*\nMe have been negotiating with CBC for several years\nnow, in an effort to get their programs made available for\nthe IAPB tape transcription network. So far, we have had\nluok in only one instance, and that is the series of programs\nknown as Canadian Concerts* Hie major difficulties have been\nin our obtaining union clearances, writers* permission, etc.,\netc. If you are going to be in ToreÂ®to over the Christmas\nholiday, I would suggest that you stop in to see Mr. Jack\nDunlop at the Jarvis Street office of CBC, and perhaps you\nwill be more successful than we have been through the mails*\nI would be curious to learn of your experiences in Toronto.\nb'ith all best wishes, I am\nCordially yours.\nSeymour H* Siegel\nDirector, WHTC\nPresident, MAEB\nSMS:as\nCrfa 4c\n17ks. ^LLXUrrW-O"
