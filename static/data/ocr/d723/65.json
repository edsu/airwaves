The Network distributes approximately eight hours of program¬\nming, by tape recording, weekly, to members subscribing to its ser¬\nvice, This fee is also based on power (with the same power classi¬\nfications as membership) and a new station does not have to pay the\nfull fee until the third year it is in the Network, The fees are:\n1st year\n250,00\n150.00\n2nd year\nO660.6O\n375.00\n225.00\n3rd year\nOTTOT\n500.00\n300.00\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to\nand from Network Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even\na Class A station paying its full third-year rate is paying only a\nlittle over $2,00 an hour for better than hOO hours of programming\nfrom the Network in a year. This is about the most inexpensive\nprogramming a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you\nhave further questions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E, Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEH:jmf"
