These programs are produced for the Rational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters with the cooperation of Radiotelevisione Italians.\nIn my previous Letter from Italy I tried to demonstrate how a cabinet\ncrisis begins in Italy and how the -President of the Republic takes the first\nsteps necessary to resolve much a crisis. If you heard that Letter you heard\nthe voice of Giuseppe Pella, as he announced his resignation as prime minis¬\nter. You heard President Luigi Einaudi, thanking Italian newsmen for keeping\nthe public informed about the development of the crisis. And, finally, you\nheard Amintore Fanfanl tell the nation — through a Radio Italians microphone\n— that President Einaudi had asked him to form a new government azkl that he\nhad accepted \"with reserve.\"\nThat1 a about where we left Italy1 s January political crisis in that pre-\nvlous letter. The ball had passed from President Einaudi to Signer Fanfanl.\nAnd Fanfanl was about to begin the exhausting series of conferences with the\ncountry's political leaders to discover whether he could command enough\nsupport to form a government and end the crisis.\nLet’s pick up the Fanfanl story at that point. You’ll recall that Fan-\nfani had-accepted President Einaudi1 s assignment with the traditional\nreserve\" at about 12 noon on Tuesday. January 12.

The fact la that he was having his troubles.\nAt one point during those days, according to a report circulating in Rome,\nFanfanl was almost at the point of giving up his attempt.\nI won’t go into detail at the moment on the reasons for those Fanfanl\ntroubles. -They had something to do with that heterogenous character of\nFanfanl’s Christian Democratic party that was the subject of a previous Letter.\nThey had something to do with the fact that Signor Fanfanl is a highly con¬\ntroversial figure on the Italian political scene| one who has been in the\nthick of bitter political fights involving such questions as land distributions\nlabor legislation! public housing.
