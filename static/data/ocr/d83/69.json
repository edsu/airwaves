Hill,\nAdministrative Vice President,\nNAEB,\nl4 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nDear Mr. Hill:\nHaving just recently returned to the city, I hasten to reply to\nyour letter of July 25th in answer to mine of the 19th.\nI can certainly understand your position with regard to funds\nfirmly committed, and agree whole heartedly that it is unfortunate\nthat these matters were not spelled out earlier, but I can assure you\nthat I did everything within business-like reason to communicate\nwith you through Prof. McLuhan at a very early date.\nYou asked that a final decision be held in abeyance for six to\neight weeks (from July 25th), so that I do hope to hear from you\nwithin the next 2 to 3 weeks or so.\nWhen I mailed you the last group of invoices re the project\naround the end of June, to my knowledge debts outstanding at this end\nwere all accounted for. I then felt free to write to you about\nthe matters of deep concern to me, and your prompt and understanding\nreply was very much appreciated.\nI can only now ask that you keep this matter before you in a\npreferential category for which I feel it is justifiably entitled."
