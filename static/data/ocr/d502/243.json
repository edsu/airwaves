Certainly the gen¬\neral educational background requir¬\ned for the head of this type of com¬\nmunity school should be no less than\nthat required of a classroom teacher,\na public school administrator or a\ncollege or university president.\n2. He should have a full understand¬\ning and appreciation of the crucially\nimportant role that mass media of com¬\nmunication play in education. — His\nbackground, experience, and phi¬\nlosophy should be such that he can\nand will direct a station as a tool\nfor the enlightenment of the citizen\nand not as a tool for his regimenta¬\ntion.\n3. Some specialized training is need¬\ned. — Actual TV station experi¬\nence which gives him a familiarity\nwith equipment needed to operate\na station and the costs involved, as\nwell as some understanding of the\nproblems and techniques of produc¬\ning programs will be most valuable.\nIt will also be desirable if his\nrecord shows some formal training\nat one or more of the qualified in¬\nstitutions of higher learning in this\ncountry that are offering radio and\ntelevision courses leading to under¬\ngraduate and graduate degrees. A\nnumber cf institutions already have\nclosed circuit television operations\nwhich include studios, equipment for\nthe production of programs, trans¬\nmitting lines and receivers. Actual\nexperience working with such equip¬\nment and the satisfactory completion\nof courses under competent instruc¬\ntion should add considerably to the\nqualifications of those planning to be\nmanagers of stations.\n4. The direction of an educational\ntelevision station calls for a high\ndegree of administrative skill. — A\nwide area of operations and a large\nand varied staff are involved. Ability\nto plan broad programs of action and\nto work with and supervise a large\nstaff of professional as well as non¬\nprofessional people is essential. Spe¬\ncial mention should be made of the\nneed for ability to handle financial\nmatters involving the preparation\nand administration of a sizable bud¬\nget. Technical training is important,\nbut the ability to develop principles\nand policies of procedure and to\nselect and direct competent staff to\ncarry them out is of far greater\nimportance.\n5. Since educational television is\ncomparatively new, the pioneering\nspirit is needed. — Those who are\nnot willing to experiment courage¬\nously and try new fields of endeavor\nhave no business in educational tele¬\nvision. While some fine research and\nexperimental work have been done,\nthere is still much we must learn\nbefore the ultimate pattern for edu¬\ncational television is determined.\nEducators have learned much from\ncommercial broadcasters and will\ncontinue to exchange ideas and ex¬\nperience with them but it should be\nkept in mind that the basic objec¬\ntives of noncommercial educational\ntelevision in numerous respects dif¬\nfer from those of commercial tele¬\nvision. The educators will have the\nresponsibility therefore of setting\ntheir own standards of operation\nand charting their own course in this\nnew field.\n6. Finally, in no other field 1 can\nthink of is public relations more im¬\nportant. — The manager of a com¬\nmunity television station, in which\nmany different groups and organiza¬\ntions have a real sense of ownership\nand participation, cannot succeed\nwithout special ability along this\nline. He must be sensitive to the\nvaried educational needs and inter¬\nests of the area served by the sta¬\ntion. Also he must be able to deter¬\nmine, analyze, and evaluate the vast\nprogram services available in a\nmultiplicity of institutions such as\nschools, museums, art galleries, pub¬\nlic welfare agencies, civic groups,\nand many other organizations that\nmay be used by the station to serve\nthese needs and interests, But still\nmore important than these is the\nmarshalling and directing the use of\nthese resources to the end that the\nwhole community will be benefited.\nHere, in my opinion, lies the cru¬\ncial test for managerial ability. A\nsuperior understanding of human\nrelations and the ability of the\nmanager to work effectively with\nindividuals and the community as\na whole and enlist their confidence\nand aid will determine to a very\nlarge extent the success or failure\nof the educational television station.\nAll this adds up to a big order.\nCertainly no manager could qualify\none hundred per cent on every count.\nBut I do believe that his ability may\nvery well be measured by the degree\nto which he meets these qualifica¬\ntions.\nReprinted from AERT Journal, Nov., 1953"
