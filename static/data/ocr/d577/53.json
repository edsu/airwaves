Only those programs approved by these committees are offered as\nregular programs by the Network. Some programs receiving divided committee\nvote are distributed, with the approval of the committee concerned, as “bonus”\nprograms to the stations using the Network service. In addition, a special\nGrants-in-Aid committee reviews carefully applications for program grants\n(discussed in some detail earlier in this report) and listens to pilot programs\nsubmitted by applicants. Ihe committee then selects those applicants which\nare recommended for grants.\nSeveral NAEB committees have been very active during this period in\nthe planning and conducting of workshops and seminars, selection of parti¬\ncipants to attend these meetings, and the selection of scholarship winners.\nCommittees so Involved include the Professional Advancement committee, the\nEngineering committee, the Research committee, the TV Management commit¬\ntee, the TV Operations committee and the Utilization committee.
