We strongly recommend that the Federal\nCommunications Commission reserve television channel space\nto serve at some future date our institution and the three\nprivate colleges in the area,”\nThe Western Massachusetts Broadcasting Council (which comprises\nAmherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts)\nfavors the reservation of television channels necessary to serve the insti¬\ntutions of higher learning, and the public and private schools as well.\nVincent C. Brann, Program Coordinator of the Radio Station at Smith College\nin Northampton, which is jointly sponsored by the W.M.B.C., said:\n\"Speaking for Smith College, I would hazard a guess that any\neducational television in the Connecticut Valley area will\nbe, when and if it comes, a four-college cooperative venture,\nsimilar to this FM Radio Project.\"\nDr. Frederick A. Meir, President of the Massachusetts State College\nat Salem, writes:\n\"We are not now using closed-circuit television.

Two said they are planning to use it.\nSixteen colleges and universities recognized a future need for it.\nDr. William F. Young, Jr., Deputy Commissioner of Education for\nMassachusetts, writes:\n\"We have much which would employ instructional television pro¬\nvided that there were educational television outlets to cover\nthe state. With adequate outlets we can foresee an increase"
