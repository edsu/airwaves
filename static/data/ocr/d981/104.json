The Problem\nDuring the past few years the pressures on both American education and the\nnew instruments and techniques of communication becoming available for its use\nhave greatly multiplied. These education-directed pressures have been felt\nincreasingly by the NAEBi from educational institutions; from Its rapidly\ngrowing membership of college, university and public school broadcasting stations\nand closed circuit installations; from other educational associations in the\nU.S.; and from national and international groups abroad. The present request\nis responsive to those pressures.\nAmong the important problems of education generally there are many In which\nNAEB believes It can provide leadership and assistance.\nA. Student-related problems:\nl. The flood of students: The sheer number of students represents one of\nthe greatest problems of our time and educational system. Maximum op¬\nportunity for their education as well as maximum quality in. their educa¬\ntion must be more efficiently sought and more effectively maintained.\nThe instruments In which we are specialists—educational television and\nradiogoffer great promise In presenting part of the answer to this\nproblem of numbers without lowering educational standards. Television\nparticularly, can spotlight many of education*$ problems and catalyze a\nreexamination out of which may come a raising of educational and teaching\n- 1 -\nstandards."
