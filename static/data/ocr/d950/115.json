Fac* Titles* The National Association of Educational Broad¬\ncasters is the most logical organization to undertake an important\nproject of this nature for several reasons:\n1* As the professional association of educational television and\nradio stations, production centers, closed circuit installa¬\ntions and the men and women engaged in these activities,\nthe Association is in an excellent position to gather the\nresearch findings now in existence and to be done in the\nfuture* Its contacts with educators, educational broadcasters\nand other professional associations are excellent. Since the\nAssociation itself does not have production or experimental\nfacilities of any kind, it is only in this type of national\nclearing house, coordination and professional development\ncapacity that it feels qualified to contribute to the imple¬\nmentation of the National Defense Education Act*\n2. On a limited scale, and with an extremely small budget, the\nNAEB has for the past four years published brief monthly\ndigests of educational broadcasting research* This project\nwould be an expansion of an on-going project which cannot\nprogress beyond its present state and reach the many educators\nwho need these materials, without additional financial assis¬\ntance,"
