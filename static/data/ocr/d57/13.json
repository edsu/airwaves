The Forum is sponsored by Barnard and fifty\ncolleges and universities from all over the country,\nA number of the Forum's sponsoring colleges have\nexpressed interest in hearing the Forum in their part of the country.\nThe three speakers. Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, President\nLynn l^hite of Mills College, California, and President Lewis Webster\nJones of Rutgers University, represent different parts of the country\nalso.\nI am not at all sure how your network operates so I am\nuncertain as to how to proceed. If you think there might be any\npossibility of a taped broadcast could you wire or call me collect\n(Monument 2-8992)?\nYours sincerely,\nPhyllis Michelfelder\nDirector of Public Relations\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nr CD .
