Local\nradio has evolved into a small number of different\nformats, which, with only a few exceptions, have become\nstandard all over the country.\nBy far the most common is the so-called \"Top 40\"\nstation, in which best-selling records (rock and roll\nor country music) are played around the clock, inter¬\nrupted occasionally by a minute or three or four minutes,\nof news ripped from the AP or UPI wires and read at\na breakneck pace. Other standard formats include the\n\"all talk\" station on which people call the* talkmaster*\nand put their opinions on the air, and the \"all news\"\nstation (only a few of these) where the same news\nheadlines with variations are repeated over and\nover again. In a few cities, classical music is\nbeing supplied by FM stations, and in many cities,\n\"middle-of-the-road\" music has proved popular on both\nAM and FM outlets.\nEducational radio has never been national, either\nin interconnection or in programming or in coverage.\nOf the over 300 educational stations, a great majority\nare low power stations designed to serve colleges and\nother institutions. Many of them perform useful\ninstitutional services such as training students of\nbroadcasting or providing a lively extra-curricular"
