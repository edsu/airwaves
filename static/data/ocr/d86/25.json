  "text": "a. Multiple section courses in basic subjects -- particularly at the junior\ncollege level -- can be taught by television to the student in his homey\nmaking more effective use of limited faculties and facilities, Tele-\nvision may be the principle method of instruction, or a supplement to\nother methods, new or traditional. The teaching of classes by television\nhas been in use by the junior colleges of Chicago for several years.\nb. With the growth of educational television stations and regional inter¬\nconnected networks, it becomes possible for several institutions to\njoin for the cooperative presentation on television of courses common\nto them all, or for one institution to offer the course on television\nfor the benefit of enrolled students in many institutions.\nIn view of the fact that the continuance of existing community educational\ntelevision stations and the development of new community educational tele¬\nvision stations is in the public interest, the Committee urges that a means\nbe found to assist these stations financially,.\nCalifornia has established two outstanding community educational television\nstations, in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Sacramento. These stations,\ndependent upon public fund raising, have suffered and continue to suffer\nfrom inadequate financing. The development of additional community stations\nin other cities is deterred by a similar lack of financing.\na. The existence of community educational television stations is a major\nasset to the State of California in the dissemination of information\nabout the process of state government and in the education of its\ncitizenry for responsible self-government.\nb. The two existing community television stations have recently been joined\nby microwave relay, providing the basis for a future statewide network"
