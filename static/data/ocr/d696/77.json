First, I received a number of valuable suggestions\nfrom our committee member Hiss Marion Gorwell, and I would like to quote\nto you one of these suggestions in detail:\nFor the information of the NAEB general membership, define\nthe real duties and general function of every national\ncommittee an i pr int them in the Newsletter. PREPARE AND\nMAIL NEWS RELEASES TO LOCAL PAPERS OF OF VARIOUS\nCOMMITTEES TELLING OF THEIR APPOINTMENT TO DESIGNATED COM*\nMITTEES BT PRESIDENT HARLEY, (DATE OF EACH APPOINTMENT\nDOSS NOT HAVE TO BE GIVEN SINCE SOKE TIME HAS ACTUALLY\nELAPSED SINCE THIS ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN.)\nI think that this suggestion is one that could easily be implemented at\nonce, and I wonder if you would be willing to undertake the chore. Perhaps\nyou could get some assistance (though I doubt that you need it) from\nU. of I. News Bureau.\nThe other project is one that I think we should get on immediately and\nwhich would respond to many of the suggestions already made to me by mem¬\nbers of our Public Relations committee. That is, to develope a SPEAKERS’\nGUIDE FOR NAEB BROADCASTERS. In the event that you are not familiar with\nwhat the NAB is doing in this area, I am enclosing this SPEAKERS GUIDE.\nCould the NAEB find money to publish and distribute its own if our committee\nprovided the copy?\nI am sending a carbon of this letter to Harold, and no doubt will get\n_some reaction from him on the subject too.\nKeep up the fine work that you are doi\"* ’\n^ Elmer G. Sul*er, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nKGS: vz\ncc: Mr. Harold E. Hill\nMiss Marion Corwell"
