Put\nthe average television actor\ninto a pair of knee breeches,\nsay, and hang one of those\nColonial collars around his\nneck, and give him a coat\nwith ruffles down around\nthe wrists, and the poor\nfellow is about as mobile\nas Grand Coulee Dam. For\nanother thing, the prose in\nhistorical dramas tends to\nbe rather densely historical.\nPeople don’t knock on the\ndoor of a house and say,\n“May I come in?” They are more\nlikely to say, “Good morning, Madam.\nA fate far beyond my control, or,\nindeed, the control of any mere mortal,\nhas brought me on this fair eighteenth\nday of June, 1793—a day filled with\na significance far beyond our poor\nken—to your humble abode. Pray, may\nI enter?” For still another thing, there\nis rarely any drama in a historical\ndrama. People are always on the verge\nof performing some immense feat of\nworld-shattering import, but they hard¬\nly ever get around to it. They just\ntalk about it, historically.\nAll this is incidental to saying that\nthere are exceptions to the rule, all right,\nand that one of the exceptions, a histori¬\ncal drama called “The Independent\nMr. Jefferson,” came along a week ago\nSunday, on N.B.C. “The Independent\nMr. Jefferson” arrived under highly\nrespectable auspices. Filmed in Chicago,\nthe program was produced by N.B.C.\nin collaboration with the National As¬\nsociation of Educational Broadcasters,\nwhich had, as I understand it, received\na grant for the project from the Ford\nFoundation. The program was dis¬\ntinguished from the average historical\ndrama by the fact that a lot of fine\nthings were said about freedom to dis¬\nsent and freedom to think as one wishes.\nThey were said boldly, clearly, and\nwithout equivocation, too.\n“The Independent Mr. Jefferson”\nfirst shows us Thomas Jefferson arriv-\nincr_ sometime in Mav. 1776, at the\nhouse of Jacob Graff, a bricklayer who\nlives on the corner of Market and\nSeventh Streets in Philadelphia. Mr.\nJefferson has come to Philadelphia as a\ndelegate to the Second Continental Con¬\ngress. He is looking for lodgings at the\nGraffs’. He carries with him very little\nbaggage—a violin, a writing box, and\ncopies of books by Milton,\nLocke, and Newton. The\nbetter part of his luggage is\nin his head, and consists of\na number of remarkable\nnotions about the rights\nof man in a free society.\nSome of these notions are\nquickly made apparent,\nsince the Graffs, man and\nwife, question him rather\nclosely before renting him\nrooms. They are cautious\nfolk and won’t rent rooms\nto just anybody, especially\nin these troublous times,\nwhat with Tories in the neighborhood,\nand so on. Mr. Graff wonders whether\nJefferson believes in God. “Surely this\nis a matter between God and me,” says\nJefferson. “What is your denomina¬\ntion?” asks Graff. “Very well, Mr.\nGraff,” says Jefferson. “I have no\nformal creed. I belong to no party,\nneither political, religious, philosophical.\nIf I could not go to Heaven but with\na party, I would not go at all.” “Be\ncareful, Mr. Jefferson,” chimes in Mrs.\nGraff. “You risk damnation!” “No,\nMrs. Graff,” says Jefferson. “I be¬\nlieve that God approves the open hom¬\nage of reason rather than the blind¬\nfold homage of fear and superstition.\nI can only say to you that I believe in\nGod and have faith in reason.” Mr. Jef¬\nferson is granted lodgings.\nHe settles down, as he says, “with\nthe baggage of my inheritance,” and\nturns to the great task of drafting a\nDeclaration of Independence for the\nColonies. All sorts of persuasive in¬\nfluences are brought to bear upon him\nto dissuade him from his work, the most\npersistent of them being voiced by John\nDickinson, also a member of the Con¬\ngress. Dickinson feels that to sever\nthe bonds with the mother country is\na horrible mistake, tantamount to trea¬\nson. Jefferson does not believe what\nDickinson believes, but passionately be¬\nlieves in his right to say it. They have\nmany long and incisive discussions.\n“The American people will find their\nbeginning: in revolt and in diversity,”\nsays Jefferson. “Let us praise diver¬\nsity. . . . Would the world be more\nbeautiful if our faces were alike? If all\nour tempers, talents, tastes—our forms,\nour wishes, aversions, and pursuits—\nwere cast exactly in the same mold,\nwhat shall we build? An America with¬\nout variety? Where all are to think\nalike? . . . Let us fire a cannon against\nthe jailors of all ages, the intellectual\nprison keepers, the civil magistrates, and\nthe religious zealots who enforce their\ndogmas upon those unwilling to re¬\nceive them. Let us say to them: Whose\nfoot is to be the measure to which ours\nare all to be cut or stretched?” Jeffer¬\nson is forced to make compromises in\nhis Declaration—for one thing, he is\nforced to remove a clause condemn¬\ning the slave trade—but at last the docu¬\nment is completed, and is signed by\nevery member of the Congress except\nMr. Dickinson.\nThere was, admittedly, barely any\naction in “The Independent Mr. Jef¬\nferson,” most of the play taking place\nin one room of the Graffs’ house, but I\nfound the dialogue sufficiently com¬\npelling to make up for the lack of move¬\nment. The script was written by Morton\nWishengrad and Robert Hartman, and\nwas based on historical research by\nDumas Malone, the Jefferson historian.\nThe actors—William Prince, as Jef¬\nferson; Henry Jones, as Dickinson;\nRobin Humphrey, as Mrs. Graff; Jack\nLester, as Graff; and Don Julian, as a\nNegro servant of Jefferson’s—were all\ncommendable, especially Mr. Prince,\nwho spoke his lines as though he fervent¬\nly believed every word of them. All in\nall, a noteworthy achievement.\n—Philip Hamburger"
