Competent scholars will gravitate not only to\nthe campuses which are able to offer the best salaries, but to the campuses which\nfor that very reason can provide companionship with other first-rate scholars, the\nprestige of being in such a community, reasonable teaching schedules, and (an\nIntangible too often forgotten by those who Inhabit university offices) administrative\ncourtesy towards professors. Needless to say, the poblic relations men of the\ncolleges-which-get-left will frantically erect Potemkin villages; but the public\nwill not long be fooled*\nLet me offer another proposition which I regard as a fact* Save perhaps on the\nNortheast Seaboard, where ideas about public h^^er education are curiously atavistic,\nstate legislatures, with much moaning and groaning, are going to make whatever\nappropriations are necessary to keep the state universities, and perhaps the state\ncolleges too, in respectable shape* They are going to do it, at lekst west of the\nAppalachians, because the voters are going to Insist that they do it. This means\nthat many tax-supported Institutions will be paying attractive professorial salaries*\nNot merely for replacements, but to provide for the inevitable expansion, these state\ncampuses are already raiding Independent colleges and universities as never before*\nAnd this Is only the beginning*"
