Cheydleur\nChairman, NAEB Research Committee\nThe Florida State University\nTallahassee, Florida\nDear Ray:\nIt's satisfying to know that the people who underwrote\nthe research seminar see in it many of the values that I’m\nsure were realized by the participants.\nThe inventory-digest of radio research that was discussed\nbriefly at the end of the seminar has made good progress. Ken\nHarwood's people are going to submit a proposal to undertake\nthe work. Equally promising is the possibility of making the\nproject a three-way undertaking between NAEB, ETRC, and NPAC.\nNAEB has agreed to go in on a one-third share basis and I am\nhopeful that ETRC will also agree to come in.\nAside from the economics of the venture, the possibility\nof a cooperative approach has exciting possibilities related to\nthe quality, distribution, and impact of the end product.\nI'll keep in touch on developments.\nSincerely yours.\nJomf M.
