Kellogg Foundation grant was agreed upon. We must carry on from this point\ntoo. I therefore thought it would be helpful, after discussion with President\nSchooley, if I called attention to earlier decisions made by the NAEB, and to the\nrate structure which becomes effective July 1.\nIF YOU LIVE BEYOND ZONE 3 FROM URBANA. THIS IS OF SPECIAL .INTEREST: You\nwill recall that postage reductions for the shipping of tapes to and from educational\ninstitutions went into effect about a year and a half ago. These reduced rates,\nhowever, did not apply to tapes to stations beyond Zone 3j this rule-change in\nfact resulted in a greatly increased burden to these stations.\nIt now appears that there is some likelihood, if adequate interest is mani¬\nfested, that this situation can be corrected. Specifically legislation to be\nintroduced will eliminate the zoning limitations now contained in Public Law 141,\napproved July 20, 1953, by virtue of which parcel post rates now apply to tapes\n(though not to films) beyond the third zone. If this proposed legislation is\napproved, it will mean a saving of as much as $150.00 to $200.00 for some of the\naffected stations.\nHJS:jy"
