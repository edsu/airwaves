These studies strengthen our conviction of the need for more\naction in California if we are to take full advantage of this valuable\nteaching tool.\nThis report represents study and discussion extending over a period of\nalmost a year in which the Committee attempted to meet on a monthly basis,\nalternating meetings between North and South. Since each member had to\nbear his own expenses, the well attended meetings testify to the deep in¬\nterest and devotion of those whom you selected. This interest does not end\nwith the attached report. The Committee wishes me to convey to you its\ndesire to continue to serve the Governor5s Office in any way which will\nadvance the cause of television's effective use. in the broad problems of\neducating and enriching the lives of our citizens.\nSincerely,\nIs/ James Day\nJD/sp\nEnel. 1\nJames Day\nChairman"
