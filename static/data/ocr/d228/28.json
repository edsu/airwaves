Harley\nDates\nMarch Bg 1962\nB.R.\nThe House of Representatives on March 7 approved# 337-68#\n132# but with two amendments. The first amendment* introduced\nby Rep® Hemphill (DrAla.) and supported by Chairman Harris* provides\nfor inclusion of closed-circuit facilities Which are associated with\na transmitter* Harris explained that his committee was not in favor of\nindependent closed-circuit TV systems being eligible under this legis¬\nlation (designed primarily to activate the unused reserved channels)\nbut did feel' it appropriate to include closed circuit which was merely\nan extension of a broadcasting facility* The second amendment limited\ngrants to public educational institutions# thus knocking out nonprofit\ncommunity educational television organisations.\nThis amendment was offered by Rep. Griffin (R.-Kidh®)# who\nwsi* uneasy about the wording of the definition of a community organi¬\nsation and not reassured by Harris9 comment that it would be possible#\nunder this definition* for an organisation like the hFL-CIO or U.S®\nChamber of Commerce \"to promote a group which could apply for a\ngrant*\" Harris and Moss fH.-Cal.) vigorously opposed amendment;# point¬\ning out that (1) the legislation contained three major safeguards (FCC\nlicense# approval by U,S. Commissioner# approval by State 2TV authority)\nagainst irresponsible non-educational applicants and (2) that this\namendment would penalise many communities that had done the most to\npioneer the EOT movement and would discriminate against many who had\nalready made a large investment in EOT.\nRap.

Both Senate and House\nleadership are determined to restore the? eligibility of the community\ncorporation.
