C. 20036\nDear Mr. Clark:\nLet me begin with an apology for the delay in responding to your ETS memo of\nJune 25 regarding programs produced for the disadvantaged. Vacations inter¬\nvened and that accounts for my tardiness at least in part.\nAnother factor may be that \"The Summer of Soul Power\" is not with us here in\nrural Appalachia. We are not faced directly with the prospect of an annual\nuprising by a militant and frustrated minority. There will be no uprising\nhere. Despair has evolved far beyond that point and isolation mitigates\nagainst it. The disadvantaged here number nearly one out of every three\npeople. Their's is that grinding kind of hopelessness which grows from phys¬\nical, intellectual and emotional isolation. Like their urban counterparts\nthey are denied freedom of access to the heritage, the aspirations and the\nbenefits of American society.\nWOUB-TV is the only television station situated in this part of Ohio. Our\ninterest is in bridging that isolation. In this respect all of our pro¬\ngramming is directed to the disadvantaged since it provides an avenue of\naccess which would otherwise be unavailable.\nWe are developing more precision in programming for specific segments of\nthe disadvantaged or specific problems experienced by them generally. I\nwill pass along information on these programs as they take shape since I'm\nsure they would be of more interest to your project than the general breast\nbeating provided above._____\n\\ _ .\nAssociate Director of Broadcasting\nJW/jn\ncc: P.D.Holmes\nNET - National Educational Television OET - Ohio Educational Television Network ETS - Division of N.A.E.B.
