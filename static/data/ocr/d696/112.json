But ©nee the pin is\n\"accepted\", there will be no changing it.\nIf possible, I would suggest TV and rddio both be\n\"included\" or neither be shown. If neither be shown,\nuse the U.S. map with the letters \"NAEB\" ©r if the\nprint would not be too small, use the complete\nspelling.\nAttached is a very rough suggestion. This could be\na blue flat U.S. map, with a raised (or flat, depending\non the price) mike and TV camera front with \"connecting\ncord\" all in silver, with KAEB in black.\nQuestion: I thought yellow and black were NAEB colors?\nYou asked what I thought?\nCoordination and Information\nCOMMISSIONERS\nREX SIKES\nLuverne\nVINCENT P.
