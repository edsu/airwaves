C.\nDear Lenay:\nThis is to alert you that a bunch of the MASS gang are coming in\nto Washington nest week. Skornia aad I will arrive at the Mayflower on\nMarch 31 and be there through the second of April, Schenkkan, Hull, and\nsome others will be arriving on April 1 for a meeting on the Washington\nConference on Live State and Regional Networks, April 2 the Center is\nholding a daylong conference at the Mayflower on ETV (this is largely a\npromotional gimmick for the Center in connection with the announcement\nof the new Ford grant.)\nAnyway? if youâ€™re going to be in town around this time I hope\nthere will be an opportunity for a few minutes conversation* We can\ncheck signals on the Magnuson Bill and, in addition, we want to talk to\nyou about the whole problem of setting up a Washington headquarters. As\nyou know, this has been discussed for several years; but this time, by\ngad, we intend to do something about it. Our main problem as usual is\nmoney and we have hopes there may be a possibility of moving in with\nsomebody else or finding someone to donate us some space and so forth.\nYour knowledge, experience, and contacts would be most valuable.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam 6. Harley\nP.3. Haven't heard a thing from Steetle yet on his efforts to persuade\nAdams to host those two meetings we discussed."
