Litchfield, execu¬\ntive director of the research or¬\nganization.\nThe project was headed by Dr.\nPaul T. David, of the Brookings\nInstitution. Beginning in March\nlast year, more than 300 teachers\nand students of political science\nobserved and reported on the\nwidely divergent methods in their\nStates of selecting national con¬\nvention delegates in both parties.\nTo Discuss Findings\nPreliminary findings of the re¬\nport, withheld for the time being,\nwill be discussed at the associa¬\ntion’s annual meeting here Sep¬\ntember 10-12.\nLast year, 15 States chose dele¬\ngates for both parties in primary\nelections. Alabama and Florida\nDemocrats also elected by pri¬\nmary. The rest of the States used\nthe State and district convention\nmethod, except Arkansas and\nGeorgia Democrats and Florida\nRepublicans who picked theirs at\nState party committee hearings.\nNew York and Illinois elected\ndistrict delegates only by primary\nand their delegates - at - large in\nconvention or committee. Minne¬\nsota elected all district and at-\nlarge delegates in primaries, ex¬\ncept, three at-large delegates who\nwere chosen in State conventions\nin each party.\nAnother great divergence is that\npnly a few States bind their dele¬\ngations to vote for a certain candi¬\ndate. Many are “advised” only.\nThe rest are completely free. Also,\nthe few delegates who are pledged\nare required to live up to their\npledges for different periods, some\nuntil after the first ballot only,\nothers until their candidate re¬\nleases them.\nWallace Says Fired Workers\nLater Charged With Being Reds\nNEW YORK, Aug. 30—(vT»)—\nHenry A. Wallace says that in\n1935 he fired several Department\nof Agriculture employees who\nwere later charged with being\nCommunists, “because I disagreed\nwith the policies they advocated.”\nThe former Vice-President’s\nstatement came in a letter to the\nNew York Times in which he\ncommented on a report made last\nweek by the Senate Internal\nSecurity Committee.\nThe report said it is believed\nthat two more Soviet espionage\nrings operating in the United\nStates government have never\nbeen exposed.\nIn tracing the background of\nalleged Communist activities, the\nreport said the \\|irst known\npenetration was a Communist\ncell in the Agricultural Adjust¬\nment Administration (AAA).\nThe committee said members\nof this group included Alger Hiss\nand his brother, Donald; Nathan\nWitt, Lee Pressman, John J. Abt,\nCharles K ramer, Henry H. Col-\nlins, Jr., Victor Perlo and Har¬\nold Ware.\nNews dispatches described the\nAAA as a body set up under th'\nthen Secretary of Agriculture Wa\nlace to handle New Deal far\nprograms.\nWallace said it is difficult\nsee why he was singled ou\nname in dispatches “when\nnever served under me and\nrid of most of the AAA rr\nof the Ware cell Not lo’\nthe celle was formed.\n“The Senate report"
