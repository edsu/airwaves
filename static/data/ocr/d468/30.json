With a little of the money\nhe bought food; and with the rest of it, he bought fruit, which he offered\nfor sale beneath that same elm tree, American initiative, sir;\ngrasping the opportunity. He soon disposed of his little stock to advan¬\ntage; and spent that night richer than he had ever been before. On the\nmorrow, he repeated the transaction. Soon he had a fruit stall under\nthe tree; then a small shop then several houses on either side. Finally,\nhe acquired such an estate that he pulled it all down and built this\nmagnificent hotel. On this plaque, which he caused to be erected, he\nhas set out his own story, and you will perceive it concludes with these\nwords: “The tree was cut down, but from its beloved trunk he caused\nhis image to be carved (that1 s it up there) as a memento of his own\nforlorn beginnings and his grateful recollections.tt From a penniless,\nragged boy, David Reynolds, rose to be one of the most prosperous\ncitizens in his community; and the owner of the finest hotel in New\nYork City and possibly the world.
