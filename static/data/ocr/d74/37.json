Dennis Sherk x\nPennsylvania State University\nCollege Park, Pennsylvania\nDear Dennis:\nWe would like to have an informal breakfast meeting of\nthe NAEB Research Committee on Tuesday, October 24, at 8:00\na.m. I do not know what the dining facilities will be at the\nMarriott but assume that we will be able to find some sort of\nplace in the hotel. There is something called the Fairfield\nInn there, which I assume is in the hotel. We will meet there\nunless I leave a note in your box at the hotel on Monday night\nindicating otherwise.\nIf you have a moment, I would appreciate a card or note\nindicating whether you will be able to make it. I am sorry\nthat there isn't time to take a poll to discover the best meetÂ¬\ning time for the entire committee. However, since this is the\nfirst full day of the convention, I assume that most of you who\nare coming at all will be there on that day. (As a matter of\nfact, this will be the only day which I will be able to be at\nthe convention.)\nHope to see you in Washington.\nBest\nSamuel L. Becker, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\nSLB:mw"
