Y. • ALGONQUIN 5 4585\nRADIO\nCONSULTANT\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nMUb 19 1B55 ,\nAM August 16, 1955 •\n?I?I?,W1,^IJ12|8|4j6|?\nMy dear I^rry?\nThank you for your good wishes.\nThe story is simple« 10? has been the\nnumber one Italian programming Station in the City*\nIt was originally a Bulova-0’Dea operation* Ihen\nthe FCC made them give up one station, Bulova took\nWNEW while O’Dea kept the largest share of 10V, giv¬\ning the rest to Weil and Hartley. They have been\nrunning it ever since.\nDick was getting old and wanted to get rid of\nhis share. This is where I come into the picture.\nThey wanted someone who had some interest in the op¬\neration, but who would not want to take over manage¬\nment. That suited me fine. Believe it or not, this\nall occurred three days before I sailed for Europe.\nI signed the papers before I left, and the rest was\nhandled by the lawyers. It became official a few\ndays ago. Of course it meant I had to dispose of my\nWLIB stock; and that’s how I got the money to go into\nthis. Now that Harry is set at WUB, all of this met\nwith his approval*\nI don’t intend changing my activities. If I\nthought I’d have to be at the Station more than a\ncouple of hours a week, I never would have gotten\ninto this. ,\nux\nMSNsda\nfours,\nV"
