Skornia\nExecutive Director, NAEB\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nAUG 1 8 I960\nAM PM\n7|8|9|10,11|12|1|2,8|4|5i?\nL\nBy mistake my copy of your August 9 letter to the Board , and\nthe accompanying ballot ..was included by mistake in Jim Miles' mail.\nI am, therefore, tardy in returning the ballot* Nevertheless, here\nit is in time, I hope, to be counted.\nThe report of the \"Search\" Committee was indeed welcome for I\nhave been like a hen on a hot griddle as I wondered what was\nhappening. The Committee's solution seems to be a most wise and\nappropriate one, and we are fortunate in having Bill's agreement\nto do the honors for the coming year. I can't quite picture us\nwithout you in charge of the reins and I hope, without leaning\ntoo hard,- that we can avail ourselves of the wisdom and the\nmany competencies which are responsible for guiding us through\nstormy waters during the past decade.\nFrankly, I am pleased about the revised schedule for the\nBoard meeting in San Francisco for that will give me the\nprivilege of three extra days to bask in your sunshine;\nBest wishes always, / ,\nx ySincerely yours.\njMrs.) Gertrude G. Broderick\nLadio-TV Education Specialist"
