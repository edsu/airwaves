      "description": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government that regulates communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable across the United States. The FCC maintains jurisdiction over the areas of broadband access, fair competition, radio frequency use, media responsibility, public safety, and homeland security. The FCC was formed by the Communications Act of 1934 to replace the radio regulation functions of the Federal Radio Commission. The FCC took over wire communication regulation from the Interstate Commerce Commission. The FCC's mandated jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United States. The FCC also provides varied degrees of cooperation, oversight, and leadership for similar communications bodies in other countries of North America. The FCC is funded entirely by regulatory fees. It has an estimated fiscal-2016 budget of US $388 million. It has 1,454 federal employees as of July 2019. ",

      "description": "WHYY-FM (90.9 FM, \"91 FM\") is a public FM radio station licensed to serve Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WHYY signed on the air on December 14, 1954, owned by the Metropolitan Philadelphia Educational Radio and Television Corporation. It was the first educational station in Philadelphia. The transmitter, originally located at 17th and Sansom Streets in Philadelphia, was donated by Westinghouse Broadcasting. In 1957, it added a sister television station, WHYY-TV on channel 35. \n\nIn 1963, WHYY-TV moved from channel 35 in Philadelphia to the stronger channel 12 in Wilmington, Delaware. At the time, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations did not allow co-owned television and radio stations to share the same base callsign if they were licensed in different markets. Philadelphia and Wilmington, then as now, are separate radio markets (though 90.9, like most major Philadelphia stations, has long claimed Wilmington as part of its primary coverage area), though they have long been a single television market. As a result, the radio station was forced to change its call sign to WUHY. 90.9 FM regained its original call sign in 1983 after the FCC eased this restriction.\n\nWhen NPR was formed in 1970, the station became a charter member and was one of the 90 stations that carried the initial broadcast of All Things Considered.",

      "description": "Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th president of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974. A member of the Republican Party, Nixon previously served as the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961, having risen to national prominence as a representative and senator from California. After five years in the White House that saw the conclusion to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, détente with the Soviet Union and China, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, he became the only president to resign from the office, following the Watergate scandal. Nixon was born into a poor family of Quakers in a small town in Southern California. He graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. He served on active duty in the Naval Reserves during World War II. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-Communist which elevated him to national prominence. In 1950, he was elected to the Senate. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the 1952 election, subsequently serving for eight years as the vice president. He unsuccessfully ran for president in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy. Nixon then lost a race for governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968, he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace in a close election. ",

He attended segregated Blackshear Elementary School. He next went to Kealing Junior High School and then Anderson High School where he met W.B. Campbell who inspired him to become a principal. He graduated from Huston-Tillotson University with his B.A. degree in history in 1954 and received his M.A. degree from Prairie View A&amp;M University in 1956. Akins also received his administrative certification from Southwest Texas State University.</p><p>In 1959, Akins began teaching at Anderson High School, his alma mater, also known as Old Anderson. Three years after beginning, he was recognized as Anderson's Teacher of the Year. In 1964, Akins was selected to be the first African American teacher at Johnson High School, a recently desegregated school. In 1971, he returned to Anderson High School to serve as Assistant Principal where he served until it was closed due to busing desegregation laws. He was then transferred to Lanier High School before becoming the first principal of the new L.C. Anderson High School in 1973. Akins worked through conflicts to set the school on its feet. After leaving L.C. Anderson High School he assumed several central administration roles for the Austin Independent School District including Assistant Superintendent for Business Affairs and Associate Superintendent for Development and Community Partnerships.</p><p>Akins received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Huston-Tillotson University in 1982. For his commitment to the Austin school district, in 1998, the district Board of Trustees voted to name Austin's newest high school after Akins. The following year the groundbreaking ceremony for the W. Charles Akins High School was held and the school opened to more than 2,700 students.</p><p>Akins passed away on March 29, 2017 at age 84.</p><citation>From The HistoryMakers™ biography: https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/A2010.025</citation></biogHist>",

The 1971 Legislative Assembly mandated that the Superintendent of Public Instruction coordinate efforts to set up an educational television system and appoint an advisory committee, but it provided no funds. Three years later the legislature established the Educational Broadcasting Commission to supercede the previous advisory committee. This commission expired in 1977. From 1972 through 1974 Montana cooperated in two programs of the Federation of Rocky Mountain States: the Educational Technology Demonstration and the Satellite Technology Demonstration.

      "description": "<biogHist><p>The American Literature Group was formed in 1921, after the Modern Language Association (MLA) reluctantly acknowledged a growing scholarly interest in the writing of the United States. At the time such literature was studied primarily in secondary schools, and most colleges and universities had no courses on the topic. Those that did, usually offered only a single survey course. The idea that American literature could stand on its own as a discipline was viewed with skepticism, it being understood at the time as a branch of the literature of England - a branch almost wholly lacking the greatness of its parent.</p><p>The members of the new group felt that in order to prove their subject reputable, they must bring it into line with the model of disciplines that had come into being in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. This model was based on the empiricism of the sciences, which had been modified in English as philology, author biography, textual history, and in its furthest speculative reach, influence study. Interpretive criticism was viewed as insufficiently scholarly, the domain of the \"amateurs\" who had dominated writing about American literature up to this point. Similarly, some in the Group thought that it should organize a way to better train secondary school teachers in the area, but this was rejected as insufficiently academic.</p><p>The Group met each December at the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association. Many of the early papers presented under the auspices of the Group dealt with the problem of how to build a proper discipline. Work was immediately begun on bibliographies and on lists of manuscript resources and dissertations written (or needed). In 1926, as an aid to research, the field was divided into three areas: the Puritan tradition, Romanticism in American literature, and the frontier spirit. In 1928, the Group's approach was documented by the essays in The Reinterpretation of American Literature (edited by Norman Forester), which added a fourth area, realism. Efforts to establish a quarterly journal that dealt exclusively with American literature began in 1924. Duke University eventually won a small bidding war for it, and the first issue of American Literature was dated March, 1929. In 1928 a full scheme of officers and procedures was put into place with the first version of the articles of organization. This document would be periodically revised over the following decades. One project that never got off the ground was a history of American literature. Almost from its inception, the Group was dissatisfied with the existing one - The Cambridge History of American Literature (1918) - because it was written prior to the discovery of much information, gave no relative weight to different figures and genres, and had no overarching vision of the area. A committee headed by Robert Speller worked toward a plan for a new history during the thirties, but conflicting positions concerning readiness and approach caused the plan to be abandoned by 1941. (Speller proceeded with the project outside of the Group, his work resulting in The Literary History of the United States (1948).)</p><p>After World War II, with American literature firmly in place as an academic area, the Group became less central to the discipline's development. The rise of American studies in the early 1950s prompted discussion and dispute concerning the difference between cultural-historical work, and more traditional emphases on literary excellence and the humanistic approach to literature (particularly in the classroom). Insurgent movements occasionally have arisen as the Group was felt to be behind the critical times. In 1968 younger members staged a protest at the annual meeting, agitating for a direct denouncement of the Vietnam War and more explicit politics in general (particularly regarding the college students whom the professors were serving). Meanwhile the Group (which became a full-fledged MLA Section in 1966) has periodically had to fight for particular kinds of recognition and privilege within its parent organization.</p><p>A full list of the Group's/Section's Chairs and Secretaries (later Executive Coordinators) is appended to this inventory and may be used as a cross-reference with the container lists to interpret the collection's coverage of various periods and figures. A fuller listing of officers from 1921-1948 is provided in Kermit Vanderbilt's book (cited below) on pages 545-548.</p><p>For more information on the American Literature Group/Section, see the following books, parts of which were written using the American Literature Section Papers: Kermit Vanderbilt, American Literature and the Academy(Philadelphia: U. Penn. Press, 1986) David R. Shumway, Creating American Civilization: A Genealogy of American Literature as an Academic Discipline(Minneapolis: U. Minn. Press, 1994).</p><citation>From the guide to the Modern Language Association of America, American Literature Section Papers, 1922-1999, (Duke University. David M.

      "description": "Joseph John Campbell (March 26, 1904 – October 30, 1987) was an American professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's best-known work is his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth. Since the publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell's theories have been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: \"Follow your bliss.\" He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his Star Wars saga.

Established in 1841 and named for the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx in which its original campus is located, Fordham is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in the northeastern United States, and the third-oldest university in New York State. Founded as St. John's College by John Hughes, then a coadjutor bishop of New York, the college was placed in the care of the Society of Jesus shortly thereafter, and has since become a Jesuit-affiliated independent school under a lay board of trustees. The college's first president, John McCloskey, was later the first Catholic cardinal in the United States. While governed independently of the church since 1969, every president of Fordham University since 1846 has been a Jesuit priest, and the curriculum remains influenced by Jesuit educational principles. Fordham is the only Jesuit tertiary institution in New York City. ",

A communist and militant anti-fascist in his youth, he spent 10 years imprisoned by the Fascist regime. Having grown disillusioned with Stalinism, he broke with the Italian Communist Party in 1937. Interned in Ventotene during World War II he, along with fellow democratic socialists, drafted the Manifesto for a free and united Europe (most commonly known as the Ventotene Manifesto) in 1941, considered a precursor of the European integration process.

      "description": "KPCC (89.3 FM) – branded 89.3 KPCC – is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to Pasadena, California, primarily serving Greater Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. KPCC also reaches much of Santa Barbara, Ventura County, Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley, and extends throughout Southern California with five low-power broadcast relay stations and three full-power repeaters. Owned by Pasadena City College and operated by the American Public Media Group via Southern California Public Radio, KPCC broadcasts a mix of public radio and news, and is an owned-and-operated station for American Public Media; in addition to serving as an affiliate for NPR and Public Radio International; and is the radio home for Sandra Tsing Loh and Larry Mantle. Besides a standard analog transmission, KPCC broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online. The KPCC studios are located in Pasadena, while the station transmitter is on Mount Wilson. The station originally signed on the air in 1957 from the Pasadena City College campus as KPCS; the call sign stood for Pasadena City Schools, which operated the college before the advent of the state-controlled Pasadena Area Community College District. It used the former KWKW-FM 250-watt transmitter and studio equipment, and a small antenna on the roof of the campus administration building that provided limited coverage. The station was operated by, and for, students who were studying broadcasting at the college. KPCS changed to KPCC on December 1, 1979. ",

      "description": "The New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) was a publicly owned company of the New Zealand Government founded in 1962. The Broadcasting Act 1976 then reformed NZBC as the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand (BCNZ). The corporation was dissolved on 1 April 1975, and replaced by three separate organisations: Radio New Zealand, Television One, and Television Two, later known as South Pacific Television. The television channels would merge again in 1980 to become Television New Zealand, while Radio New Zealand remained unchanged. At 7:30pm on 1 June 1960, New Zealand's first television channel, AKTV2, started broadcasting in Auckland from the NZBC building at 74 Shortland Street, previously used to broadcast public radio station 1YA and now home to The University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery. Owned and operated by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service. With the passing of the Broadcasting Corporation Act 1961, the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was established, with F. J. Llewellyn as its chairman. During the course of the Bill through the House of Representatives in the session of 1961, provision was made for the establishment of privately owned stations and, although strongly opposed by the Labour Opposition, this became part of the Act. But before such stations could be established, the corporation, which took office on 1 April 1962, was required to undertake a review of existing coverage. At the time of transfer, the Corporation assumed responsibility for the control of 35 radio stations and four television stations. The number of licence holders for sound radio grew to more than 600,000. The tremendous appeal of television was demonstrated by the fact that in the first three-year period of development the number of licence holders reached a total of 275,000 (November 1964). The annual income from all sources exceeded NZ£5,000,000, more than NZ£250,000 being paid in taxation. Initially, the four television facilities were unlinked, and programming had to be shipped between each station. However, for urgent news video, it was possible to link the two stations in each island using Post Office Telephone Department (now Chorus) coaxial toll lines at the expense of a number of voice channels. This method was too costly for the regular programming.[citation needed] ",

Owned by Birach Broadcasting Corporation, the station features a brokered ethnic format, except for a midday show which features a mix of easy listening, adult standards and big band music. WEW's daily schedule consists largely of foreign language programming, mostly targeting area Bosnians, and weekend programming featuring German, Italian, Polish, and Spanish. The studios are located on Hampton Avenue in St. Louis, and its transmitter is located in Caseyville, Illinois. WEW is licensed to only broadcast during daytime hours, with a power of 1,000 watts on 770 kHz. On April 28, 2016 the station was granted a Federal Communications Commission construction permit to move to a new transmitter site, increase day power to 10,000 watts and add nighttime operation with 200 watts while still protecting clear-channel station WABC (AM) in New York City.

The network is a founding member of National Public Radio and an affiliate of Public Radio International, American Public Media, and BBC World Service. Its main studio is located in Ann Arbor, with satellite studios in Flint and offices in Grand Rapids. It currently airs news and talk, which it has since July 1, 1996. WUOM (91.7 FM) in Ann Arbor is the flagship station of Michigan Radio, broadcasting with a 93,000 watt transmitter from a 237 meters (778 ft) tower near Pinckney. The University of Michigan applied to the FCC on September 11, 1944, for a station at 43.1 FM (part of a band of frequencies used for testing of Frequency Modulation) with a power of 50,000 watts. At the time an assignment on the new FM band was seen as a significant disadvantage. ",

He was born in Hamburg, Germany, to a German mother and a Liberian father of Vai ethnicity, the grandson of Momulu Massaquoi, the consul general of Liberia in Germany at the time. In his autobiography, Destined to Witness, Massaquoi describes his childhood and youth in Hamburg during the Nazis' rise to power. His autobiography provides a unique point of view: he was one of the very few German-born children of German and African descent. He was often shunned, but escaped Nazi persecution. This duality remained a key theme throughout his early life until he witnessed racism as practiced in colonial Africa and later in the Jim Crow American South. ",

      "description": "Charles William Tobey (July 22, 1880 – July 24, 1953) was an American politician, who was a Governor of New Hampshire and a United States senator. He was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, the son of William Tobey, an accountant, and Ellen Hall Parker Tobey. His father had moved to Massachusetts from Maine in the 1860s. Charles Tobey had relatively little formal education. He attended the Roxbury Latin School for four years (being part of the Class of 1897), but was forced to withdraw before graduation because of family financial difficulties. He had a thorough knowledge of the Bible, however, which he gained from his mother, an ardent Baptist. As a result, Tobey's speeches were always marked by a generous sprinkling of biblical quotations and classical allusions. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Chalmers Marquis, a longtime lobbyist for educational television, attended the University of Chicago College before moving on to the University of Illinois, where he trained in journalism and broadcasting and studied under Frank Schooley . While at the University, Marquis created a campus radio station that broadcast from a photography store in Urbana. Upon completion of his courses in 1950, Marquis accepted a job as a \"dolly-pusher\" at WGN TV, where he remained for three years. He then took a position at WBBM TV, the CBS affiliate in Chicago. There, he produced and directed numerous commercials in addition to his work with regular programming.</p><p>Marquis's desire to see television used as an instrument of learning rather than merely passive entertainment prompted his acceptance in 1955 of a position with WTTW, Chicago's public television station. First working as a producer/director, Marquis soon moved into the realm of public relations and development, and eventually became director of programming. He remained with WTTW for nine years, during which time the station was the largest public broadcaster in the United States, setting the standard for educational broadcasting.</p><p>Despite various obstacles, such as a lack of funding and a kilowatt signal approximately one quarter as powerful as those of commercial stations, Marquis fostered the genesis of numerous projects and expanded WTTW. He organized Chicago Area School Television (CAST), which broadcasted two channels into local classrooms.</p><p>In 1965 Marquis became the first full-time executive director of Educational Television Stations (ETS, created in 1963), the newly-formed television arm of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) . He participated in the establishment of the Educational Television Stations Program Service (later the Public Television Library ), which supplied programming to public television stations. He was also involved in the movement to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) .</p><p>Due to the consistent lack of funding for public television stations, Marquis spent increasing amounts of time lobbying for government funding, particularly from administrative departments such as Health, Education, and Welfare. He fought to push through the House of Representatives legislation that eventually became the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 .</p><p>Marquis's work at ETS led to his position in 1970 as Executive Vice President of NAEB, which he followed with a term at the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Marquis then became a full-time lobbyist as legislative liaison for the National Association of Public Television Stations (NAPTS), which later became America's Association of Public Television, Inc. (APTV), a lobbying arm of the Association of America's Public Television Stations (APTS).</p><p>Along with his work for NAPTS, Marquis frequently lobbied Congress on behalf of the Children's Television Workshop . He spent much of his time gathering evidence, later presented to various congressional committees, demonstrating the positive impact of public broadcasting and the necessity for its continued existence. His work involved efforts to obtain funds from the National Science Foundation, to procure government funding for CTW programs such as 3-2-1 Contact, Square One TV, and Ghostwriter, and to further the development of the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television.</p><citation>From the guide to the Chalmers Marquis Papers, 1978-1993, and undated, 1985-1992, (Mass Media and Culture)</citation></biogHist><biogHist><p>Public broadcasting lobbyist.</p><p>Director of programming, WTTW (Chicago, IL) 1955-1964; Executive director, Educational Television Stations division, National Association of Educational Broadcasters, 1965-1970; Legislative liasion, National Association of Public Television Stations; Lobbyist on behalf of the Children's Television Workshop.</p><citation>From the description of Chalmers Marquis Papers, 1978-1993 and undated (University of Maryland Libraries).

Licensed to Pompano Beach, Florida, United States, the station is owned by the Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., through licensee Beasley Media Group, LLC. Its studios are in Boca Raton and the transmitter was in Parkland. The Pompano Beach Broadcasting Corporation received a construction permit for a daytime-only radio station on 980 kHz in Pompano Beach on October 15, 1958. WLOD, standing for \"Wonderful Land of Dreams\", went on the air on May 1, 1959. The station went through several changes of ownership in its first few years. Before going on air, Wellington Shilling and Charles Johnson had sold their stakes to Arthur Harre and Leonard Versluis; within a year, the station had been acquired by the Franklin Broadcasting Company, which owned it until selling to Sunrise Broadcasting Company in 1965. The station sponsored a women's tennis tournament, which was dubbed the WLOD International. ",

      "description": "The University of Denver (DU) is a private research university in Denver, Colorado. Founded in 1864, it is the oldest independent private university in the Rocky Mountain Region of the United States. It is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\". DU enrolls approximately 5,700 undergraduate students and 7,200 graduate students. The 125-acre (0.51 km2) main campus is a designated arboretum and is located primarily in the University Neighborhood, about five miles (8 km) south of downtown Denver. In March, 1864, John Evans, former Governor of the Colorado Territory, appointee of President Abraham Lincoln, founded the Colorado Seminary in the newly created (1858) city of Denver, which was then a mining camp. At its founding the seminary was non-sectarian and operated by Methodist Episcopal church. It struggled in the early years of its existence. In 1880 it was renamed the University of Denver. Although doing business as the University of Denver, DU is still legally named Colorado Seminary. The first buildings of the university were located in downtown Denver in the 1860s and 1870s, but concerns that Denver's rough-and-tumble frontier town atmosphere was not conducive to education prompted a relocation to the current campus, built on the donated land of potato farmer Rufus Clark, some seven miles (11 km) south of the downtown core. The university grew and prospered alongside the city's growth, appealing primarily to a regional student body prior to World War II.[citation needed] After the war, the large surge in GI bill students pushed DU's enrollment to over 13,000 students, the largest the university has ever been, and helped to spread the university's reputation to a national audience.

They sang traditional folk songs from around the world, as well as blues, gospel music, children's songs, labor songs, and American ballads, and sold millions of records at the height of their popularity. Their style inspired the commercial \"folk boom\" that followed them in the 1950s and 1960s,[citation needed] including such performers as the Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul, and Mary, the Rooftop Singers, the Seekers, Joan Baez, Don Mclean and Bob Dylan. In 1940, Lee Hays and Pete Seeger co-founded the Almanac Singers, which promoted peace and isolationism during World War II, working with the American Peace Mobilization (APM). It featured many songs opposing entry into the war by the U.S. In June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the APM changed its name to the American People's Mobilization and altered its focus to supporting U.S. entry into the war. The Almanacs supported the change and produced many pro-war songs urging the U.S. to fight on the side of the Allies. The Almanac Singers disbanded after the U.S. entered the war. ",

Hailing from Philadelphia, Feldman was a trained lawyer and alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania, which he attended on a scholarship. He served in the Army Air Force during the Second World War prior to joining Kennedy's campaign trail in 1957. Under Kennedy he was tasked with compiling negative information on Richard Nixon during Kennedy's election campaign, as well as helping with speech writing and television interviews. His files on Nixon became known collectively as the \"Nixopedia\". He also worked on agriculture issues and foreign relations on the subject of nuclear arms sales, often meeting secretly with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir. He was known for the rhyming couplets used when he and Theodore C. Sorensen, whom he succeeded as White House Counsel, traded memos. In 1964 The New York Post called him \"the White House's anonymous man.\" ",

      "description": "Kenneth Mackenzie Clark, Baron Clark OM CH KCB FBA (13 July 1903 – 21 May 1983) was a British art historian, museum director, and broadcaster. After running two important art galleries in the 1930s and 1940s, he came to wider public notice on television, presenting a succession of programmes on the arts during the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the Civilisation series in 1969. The son of rich parents, Clark was introduced to the arts at an early age. Among his early influences were the writings of John Ruskin, which instilled in him the belief that everyone should have access to great art. After coming under the influence of the connoisseur and dealer Bernard Berenson, Clark was appointed director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford aged twenty-seven, and three years later he was put in charge of Britain's National Gallery. His twelve years there saw the gallery transformed to make it accessible and inviting to a wider public. During the Second World War, when the collection was moved from London for safe keeping, Clark made the building available for a series of daily concerts which proved a celebrated morale booster during the Blitz.

      "description": "Washington State University (Washington State, WSU, or Wazzu) is a public land-grant research university in Pullman, Washington. Founded in 1890, WSU is one of the oldest land-grant universities in the American West. With an undergraduate enrollment of 24,470 and a total enrollment of 29,686, it is the second largest institution for higher education in Washington state behind the University of Washington. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". The WSU Pullman campus is perched upon a hill, characterized by open spaces, views, deep green conifers, and a restrained red brick and basalt material palette—materials originally found on site. The university is nestled within the rolling topography of the Palouse in rural eastern Washington and remains intimately connected to the town, the region, and the landscape in which it sits. The university also operates branch campuses across Washington known as WSU Spokane, WSU Tri-Cities, and WSU Vancouver, all founded in 1989. In 2012, WSU launched an Internet-based Global Campus, which includes its online degree program, WSU Online. In 2015, WSU expanded to a sixth campus, known as WSU Everett. These campuses award primarily bachelor's and master's degrees. Freshmen and sophomores were first admitted to the Vancouver campus in 2006 and to the Tri-Cities campus in 2007. Enrollment for the four campuses and WSU Online exceeds 29,686 students. This includes 1,751 international students. ",

      "description": "The Casa Loma Orchestra was an American dance band active from 1929 to 1963. Until the rapid multiplication in the number of swing bands from 1935 on, the Casa Loma Orchestra was one of the top North American dance bands. With the decline of the big band business following the end of World War II, it disbanded in 1947. However, from 1957 to 1963, it re-emerged as a recording session band in Hollywood, made up of top-flight studio musicians under the direction of its most notable leader of the past, Glen Gray. The reconstituted band made a limited number appearances live and on television and recorded fifteen LP albums for Capitol Records before Gray died in 1963. The band assembled in 1927 as the Orange Blossoms, one of several Detroit groups that came out of the Jean Goldkette office. The band adopted the name \"Casa Loma\" by the time of its first recordings in 1929, shortly after it played an eight-month engagement at Casa Loma in Toronto, which was being operated as a hotel at the time. The band never played at Casa Loma under that name, still appearing as the Orange Blossoms at that time. ",

Eighty seven public and private radio and television organizations representing 46 countries from the five continents form and outline the community of the Prix Italia which is in continuous evolution. Unique in the world, among International festivals and prizes, it is the organizational and decision-making body of the Prix. The delegates decide and resolve the editorial outline and elect the President. RAI is in charge and responsible of the organization of the manifestation, and the General Secretariat has its headquarters in Rome. Prix Italia is held in an Italian city of art and culture annually every September for a week, in collaboration with local authorities. The event is an authentic and unique moment of congregation and professional comparison on the quality of the programmes. It is the right venue where one can collaborate and define agreements and exchange points of view. ",

Scripps as United Press and merged in 1958 with International News Service, which had been established by William Randolph Hearst in 1909. The service, which is distributed worldwide, is headquartered in New York.</p><citation>From the description of Press files, ca.1970-1985. (Florida State Archive). WorldCat record id: 32413400</citation><p>E. W. Scripps started the United Press Association in 1907, by combining three regional news services. Under General Manager Roy Howard, the UP became the first North American news agency to serve newspapers around the globe. It established European bureaus. It merged with International News Services (founded by Randolph Hearst) to become UPI in 1958. UPI struggled through revolving ownerships and bankruptcies durng the 1980s and 1990s. Today UPI distributes news to media outlets, businesses, governments, and researchers. They are headquartered in Washington, D.C. The following are \"firsts\" accomplished by UPI:</p><list><item>1932 -- Emphasizes the \"byline\" story</item><item>1935 -- First news service for radio</item><item>1945 -- First all-sports wire</item><item>1952 -- International TV news film service launched</item><item>1973 -- UPI Cable Newswire launched</item><item>1981 -- First satellite data transmission by any news agency</item><item>1984 -- First customized news selection services for broadcasters and newspapers</item><item>1990s-- First news wire on BBS systems and World Wide Web</item><item>2001 -- Deploys multi-lingual \"virtual newsroom\" independent of physical location</item><item>2002 -- First multi-lingual news industry taxonomy</item></list><citation>From the guide to the United Press International : Santa Fe Office Collection, 1947-1990, (Museum of New Mexico. Fray Angélico Chávez History Library.)</citation><p>The Brooklyn Dodgers were a baseball team based in Brooklyn and founded in 1883. Between 1883 and 1931, the team that would become the Brooklyn Dodgers went through numerous monikers including the Bridegrooms, the Superbas, the Robins, and the Trolley Dodgers--purportedly coined for Brooklynites ability to dodge the dangerous streetcars in Brooklyn. In 1913, the team moved to a new home field, Ebbets Field, and the next year hired Manager Wilbert Robinson (hence the name the Brooklyn Robins) who would become the winningest manager in the teams' history. After 18 years at the helm, Robinson retired as manager in 1931. The following year, in 1932, the team officially became the Brooklyn Dodgers and remained so until the end of 1957 season, when the team was moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>Throughout the teams' history, under various names, the team won the National League Pennant nine times between 1916 to 1957. The Brooklyn Dodgers also made history by being the first team to sign a black player into the modern major leagues--Jackie Robinson. Originally signed to the Dodgers minor league team, the Montreal Royals, in October of 1945, Robinson was brought up to the majors in 1947, where he subsequently earned the Rookie of the Year award that same year. Although the team played in the World Series nine times, they won the World Series only once in 1955. Regardless, the teams' fans were nearly as renowned at the team itself, known for their antics and loyalty. In 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers became the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ebbets Field was demolished in 1960.</p><list><item>Sources:</item><item>Weinstein, Stephen. \"Brooklyn Dodgers.\" InThe Encyclopedia of New York City, edited by Kenneth T. Jackson, 155-156.

      "description": "The Slickee Boys were a Washington, D.C. area punk-psychedelic-garage rock band whose most-remembered lineup consisted of guitarist Marshall Keith, guitarist Kim Kane, singer Mark Noone and drummer Dan Palenski. The group was named after a GI slang term for the rockabilly-inspired Korean street toughs who sold black market goods to American soldiers. The band was founded in 1976 by guitarists Kim Kane and Marshall Keith, with Kane as principal songwriter, and featured Martha Hull on vocals. The band released its first EP, Hot and Cool, that same year. Separated Vegetables, the group's full-length debut, followed in 1977, but Kane disliked the album's sound to such a degree that he limited the initial pressing to 100 copies. ",

      "description": "Louis-Hector Berlioz[n 1] (11 December 1803 – 8 March 1869) was a French Romantic composer and conductor. His output includes orchestral works such as the Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy, choral pieces including the Requiem and L'Enfance du Christ, his three operas Benvenuto Cellini, Les Troyens and Béatrice et Bénédict, and works of hybrid genres such as the \"dramatic symphony\" Roméo et Juliette and the \"dramatic legend\" La Damnation de Faust. The elder son of a provincial doctor, Berlioz was expected to follow his father into medicine, and he attended a Parisian medical college before defying his family by taking up music as a profession. His independence of mind and refusal to follow traditional rules and formulas put him at odds with the conservative musical establishment of Paris. He briefly moderated his style sufficiently to win France's premier music prize – the Prix de Rome – in 1830, but he learned little from the academics of the Paris Conservatoire. Opinion was divided for many years between those who thought him an original genius and those who viewed his music as lacking in form and coherence. ",

      "description": "The Lowell Institute is a United States educational foundation located in Boston, Massachusetts, providing both free public lectures, and also advanced lectures. It was endowed by a bequest of $250,000 left by John Lowell Jr., who died in 1836. The Institute began work in the winter of 1839/40, and an inaugural lecture was given on December 31, 1839, by Edward Everett. Lowell's will set up an endowment with a principal of over $1 million (in 1909[clarification needed]), stipulating 10% of its net annual income was to be added back to help it grow. None of the fund was to be invested in a building for the lectures. The trustees of the Boston Athenaeum were made visitors of the fund, but the trustee of the fund is authorized to select his own successor. In naming a successor, the Institute's trustee must always choose in preference to all others some male descendant of Lowell's grandfather, John Lowell, provided there is one who is competent to hold the office of trustee, and of the name of Lowell. The sole trustee so appointed is solely responsible for the entire selection of the lecturers and the subjects of lectures.[citation needed] ",

The district has its headquarters in the Fisher Building of the New Center area of Detroit. The school district has experienced extensive financial difficulties over a series of years. From 1999 to 2005, and from 2009 to the reorganization in 2016, the district was overseen by a succession of state-appointed emergency financial managers. ",

Armsey (December 13, 1917 – November 2, 2008) was an American who served as an executive at the Ford Foundation where he oversaw the distribution of nearly a half billion dollars in grants. Through his efforts in the 1960s, the foundation denied grants to segregated universities, leading to the admission of the first black students at several major universities in the United States. Armsey was born in Olney, Illinois on December 13, 1917 and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism in 1941. He served for five years in the United States Army during World War II as a public relations officer at various posts in the United States and in New Delhi in the India-Burma Theater, and left the Army with the rank of Major. After his military service, he returned to the University of Illinois was awarded a master's degree in political science in 1946. ",

After a year at this post, Armsey went on to serve five years as the Public Relations Director at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This experience prepared him to serve as assistant to the chancellor at NYU beginning in 1952. During his four years at NYU, Armsey would hold several positions. Besides being Assistant to the Chancellor, Armsey was also the head of Public Relations, and the Vice President and Director of the New York University Press. He was an administrator for the Challenge, a newspaper, and he also had ties to the Alumni Bulletin, Alumni News, and the NYU Daily Bulletin . Armsey was also involved in the community, a member of the Community Planning Board #2, helping to clean up the Washington Square area, while at the same time acquiring sites for buildings to expand the Washington Square campus. During Armsey's time at NYU, Henry T. Heald was Chancellor. Heald had been President of the Illinois Institute of Technology, and when he was appointed Chancellor of NYU, he brought Armsey to New York with him to be his assistant. After his tenure at NYU, Heald became president of the Ford Foundation, and Armsey left to work with him there.</p><p>Sources Hevesi, Dennis. \"James Armsey Dies at 90, Oversaw College Grants\", The New York Times, November 19, 2008</p><citation>From the guide to the Records of the Office of the Assistant to the Chancellor/President (James W.

      "description": "WNAX (570 AM) is a radio station in Yankton, South Dakota, currently owned by Saga Communications, Inc., which broadcasts a News/Talk format. WNAX broadcasts at 5,000 watts around the clock from a tower in eastern Yankton. Due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial, transmitter power, and South Dakota's flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity) the station's 5,000-watt signal provides at least secondary coverage during the day to most of the eastern half of South Dakota, much of western Iowa, and most of the densely populated portion of Nebraska. In addition to its home markets of Sioux City and Sioux Falls, WNAX provides a strong grade B signal to Omaha and Lincoln. Under the right conditions, its daytime signal penetrates as far south as Kansas City, as far north as Fargo and well east of Des Moines with a good radio. Among U.S. stations its daytime land coverage is exceeded only by KFYR in Bismarck, North Dakota. A single tower is used during the day. Three towers are used at night to protect clear-channel stations on adjacent frequencies, concentrating the signal along the Sioux Falls-Sioux City corridor. ",

It operated primarily at 1250 kHz AM, though it was on other frequencies prior to 1940, and shared time with another station, WREN, which broadcast from Lawrence and then from Topeka (now Kansas City-based KYYS). KFKU, in its later years on the air for as little as 30 minutes per day, broadcast its final programs in 1987; its closure occurred as a result of its time-share partner going off the air and had been preceded by the university focusing on its FM station, KANU, which began broadcasting in 1952. KFKU relied on WREN's broadcasting equipment to transmit for almost all of its history, effectively making it a phantom radio station. WREN returned to the air in 1991, but KFKU did not, and its license was later canceled by the Federal Communications Commission. ",

      "description": "KETC, virtual channel 9 (UHF digital channel 23), branded on air as Nine PBS, is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station licensed to St. Louis, Missouri, United States. The station is owned by St. Louis Regional Public Media. KETC's studios are located at the Dana Brown Communications Center on Olive Street in St. Louis' Grand Center neighborhood, and its transmitter is located in South St. Louis County. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 9 in both standard and high definition, and on AT&T U-verse channels 9 (SD) and 1009 (HD). The station first signed on the air on September 20, 1954, the call letters KETC representing the St. Louis Educational Television Commission, the former name of the organization responsible for bringing public television to St. Louis. It was the first community-licensed educational television station in the United States. The station's first general manager was Charles Guggenheim, who hired the technical staff and first group of producer/director/writers, five in all. While waiting for the broadcasting tower to be completed, a number of programs were recorded using kinescope recording technology (the same as used for The Honeymooners). Once on the air, there were a number of award-winning programs produced by Mayo Simon, Bill Hartzell, Ran Lincoln and Guggenheim. They included the first live broadcast of the St. Louis City Council. Another featured the St. Louis Post-Dispatch nature columnist Leonard Hall of Possum Trot Farm. Among the taped program series was a pioneering science program intended for sixth graders to see in their classrooms, Science in Sight, produced by Martin L. Schneider. Film making was encouraged, and with Len Hall's collaboration a documentary film about the rare beauty of the relatively unprotected Current River was produced. It was later used by the National Audubon Society in the successful effort to make Current River the first National Scenic River under the protection of the National Park Service. ",

      "description": "Riverside Church is a Baptist and Congregationalist church in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, on the block bounded by Riverside Drive, Claremont Avenue, 120th Street and 122nd Street near Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus and across from Grant's Tomb. It is an interdenominational church that is associated with the American Baptist Churches USA and the United Church of Christ. The church was conceived by philanthropist businessman and Baptist John D. Rockefeller Jr. in conjunction with Presbyterian minister Harry Emerson Fosdick as a large, interdenominational church in Morningside Heights, which is surrounded by academic institutions. The original building opened in 1930; it was designed by Henry C. Pelton and Allen & Collens in the Neo-Gothic style. It contains a nave consisting of five architectural bays; a chancel at the front of the nave; a 22-story, 392-foot (119 m) tower above the nave; a narthex and chapel; and a cloistered passageway that connects to the eastern entrance on Claremont Avenue. Near the top of the tower is the church's main feature, a 74-bell carillon—the heaviest in the world—dedicated to John Rockefeller Jr.'s mother Laura Spelman Rockefeller. A seven-story wing was built to the south of the original building in 1959 to a design by Collens, Willis & Beckonert, and was renamed for Martin Luther King Jr. in 1985. The Stone Gym to the southeast, built in 1915 as a dormitory, was designed by Louis E. Jallade and was converted to a gymnasium in 1962. ",

It originally aired for only five hours a day, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. As the difficulties associated with bringing PBS programming decreased, channel 9 increased its schedule, and now operates 24 hours a day.

      "description": "The State University of New York at Buffalo, commonly referred to as the University at Buffalo (UB) or SUNY Buffalo, is a public research university with campuses in Buffalo and Amherst, New York, United States. The university was founded in 1846 as a private medical college and merged with the State University of New York system in 1962. As of Fall 2020, the university enrolls 32,347 students in 13 colleges, making it the largest public university in the state of New York. Since its founding by United States President Millard Fillmore, the university has evolved from a small medical school to a large research university. Today, in addition to the College of Arts and Sciences, the university houses the largest state-operated medical school, dental school, education school, business school, engineering school, and pharmacy school, and is also home to New York’s only state-operated law school. UB has the largest enrollment, largest endowment, and most research funding among the universities in the SUNY system. The university offers bachelor’s degrees in over 100 areas of study, as well as 205 master's degrees, 84 doctoral degrees, and 10 professional degrees. The University at Buffalo and the University of Virginia are the only colleges founded by United States Presidents. ",

      "description": "Duquesne University of the Holy Spirit (/duːˈkeɪn/ or /djuːˈkeɪn/) (Duquesne University or Duquesne) is a private Catholic research university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,. Founded by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, Duquesne first opened as the Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost in October 1878 with an enrollment of 40 students and a faculty of six. In 1911, the college became the first Catholic university-level institution in Pennsylvania. It is the only Spiritan institution of higher education in the world.[citation needed] It is named for an 18th-century governor of New France, Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville. Duquesne has since expanded to over 9,300 graduate and undergraduate students within a self-contained 49-acre (19.8 ha) hilltop campus in Pittsburgh's Bluff neighborhood. The school maintains an associate campus in Rome and encompasses ten schools of study. The university hosts international students from more than 80 countries although most students—about 80%—are from Pennsylvania or the surrounding region. Duquesne is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\". There are more than 93,000 living alumni of the university including two cardinals and the current bishop of Pittsburgh. ",

Logan is best known for his portrayal of Boba Fett from the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, for which he was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film (Supporting Actor) at the age of 14. Logan also voiced Fett in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Logan was born in Auckland on 6 June 1987. He broke into acting when his amateur rugby union team was scouted for a TV commercial, where he was chosen to play the role of a small child who gets knocked into the mud by Auckland rugby star Michael Jones. Picked up by a casting agent, he began to do more commercials and TV appearances, including a recurring role in episodes of the New Zealand-based medical series Shortland Street and a guest appearance in the international series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.

      "description": "The Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was a government agency that regulated United States radio communication from its creation in 1927 until 1934, when it was succeeded by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FRC was established by the Radio Act of 1927, which replaced the Radio Act of 1912 after the earlier law was found to lack sufficient oversight provisions, especially for regulating broadcasting stations. In addition to increased regulatory powers, the FRC introduced the standard that, in order to receive a license, a radio station had to be shown to be \"in the public interest, convenience, or necessity\". Although radio communication (originally known as \"wireless telegraphy\") was developed in the late 1890s, it was largely unregulated in the United States until the passage of the Radio Act of 1912. This law set up procedures for the Department of Commerce to license radio transmitters, which initially consisted primarily of maritime and amateur stations. The broadcasting of news and entertainment to the general public, which began to be developed early 1920s, was not foreseen by this legislation. ",

      "description": "The University of Scranton is a private Jesuit university in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1888 by William O'Hara, the first Bishop of Scranton, as St. Thomas College. In 1938, the college was elevated to university status and took the name The University of Scranton. The institution was operated by the Diocese of Scranton from its founding until 1897. While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the university, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942. In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the university. During the 1960s, the university became an independent institution under a lay Board of Trustees. The university is composed of three colleges: The College of Arts and Sciences, The Kania School of Management, and The Panuska College of Professional Studies; all contain both undergraduate and graduate programs. Previously, the university had a College of Graduate and Continuing Education, which has been folded into the colleges of the respective programs. The university offers 65 Bachelor's Degree Programs, 29 Master's Degree Programs, 43 Minors, and 38 Undergraduate Concentrations, as well as a Doctor of Physical Therapy Program, a Doctor of Nursing Practice Program, and a Doctor of Business Administration Program.

A member of the Democratic Party, he holds the record for longest-serving member of Congress in American history, representing Michigan for more than 59 years. He most recently served as the representative for Michigan's 12th congressional district. A longtime member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Dingell was the chairman of the committee from 1981 to 1995 and 2007 to 2009. Dingell began his congressional career by succeeding his father, John Dingell Sr., as representative for Michigan's 16th congressional district on December 13, 1955; his father had held the seat for 22 years. He left office on January 3, 2015. Having served for over 59 years, he has the longest congressional tenure in U.S. history. Together with Jamie Whitten and Joseph Gurney Cannon, he served in the House under more presidents than anyone else: 11. He was also the longest-serving Dean of the U.S. House of Representatives and Dean of the Michigan congressional delegation. Dingell was one of the final two World War II veterans to have served in Congress; the other was Texas Representative Ralph Hall, who also left Congress in 2015. During his time in Congress in addition to protecting the automobile industry important to his district, Dingell was instrumental in passage of the Medicare Act, the Water Quality Act of 1965, Clean Water Act of 1972, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Clean Air Act of 1990, and the Affordable Care Act, among others. He was most proud of his work on the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ",

It was founded by evangelist and businessman Dwight Lyman Moody in 1886. Since its founding, MBI's main campus has been located on the Near North Side of Chicago. Moody also operates a graduate campus in Plymouth, Michigan. In 1883, Emma Dryer, with Moody's permission, organized and headed what was known as the \"May Institute\". These were weekly meetings in which church members would meet and pray. Most important however, would be the open discussions among the church members. Many of the church members began to request that Moody open up a new school. This school would serve as a training school for the youth of the church, a place where future evangelists could learn the skills necessary to carry on in the Christian revival tradition. ",

The library is housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.; it also maintains a conservation center in Culpeper, Virginia. The library's functions are overseen by the Librarian of Congress, and its buildings are maintained by the Architect of the Capitol. The Library of Congress is one of the largest libraries in the world. Its \"collections are universal, not limited by subject, format, or national boundary, and include research materials from all parts of the world and in more than 450 languages.\" Congress moved to Washington, D.C., in 1800 after holding sessions for 11 years in the temporary national capitals in New York City and Philadelphia. In both cities, members of the U.S. Congress had access to the sizable collections of the New York Society Library and the Library Company of Philadelphia. The small Congressional Library was housed in the United States Capitol for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s. ",

The university is known for its strength in science and engineering, and is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences. Caltech was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891 and began attracting influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1920. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán.

Owned by the NBC Owned Television Stations subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), it is sister to Class A Telemundo owned-and-operated station WZDC-CD (channel 44) and regional sports network NBC Sports Washington. WRC-TV and WZDC-CD share studios and transmitter facilities on Nebraska Avenue in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Northwest Washington. The station traces its roots to experimental television station W3XNB, which was put on the air by the Radio Corporation of America, the then-parent company of NBC, in 1939. A construction permit with the commercial callsign WNBW (standing for \"NBC Washington\") was first issued on channel 3 (60–66 MHz, numbered channel 2 prior to 1946) on December 23, 1941. NBC requested this permit to be cancelled on June 29, 1942; channel 3 was reallocated to Harrisonburg, Virginia as WHSV-TV. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Mills Edwin Godwin, Jr., was born November 19, 1914, at Chuckatuck in Nansemond County, now the City of Suffolk, Virginia.</p><p>He completed public school and attended the college of William and Mary. He obtained his degree in law from the University of Virginia in 1938. Honorary doctorate degrees have been awarded him by Elon College, Roanoke College, Elmira College, the College of William and Mary, Washington and Lee University, Hampden-Sydney College, the University of Richmond and Bridgewater College.</p><p>While awaiting a commission in the U. S. Navy in World War II, he was appointed a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he served for three years prior to resuming the practice of law in Suffolk until he was elected governor of Virginia in 1965.</p><p>He first entered politics in 1948 when he began service in the House of Delegates. From 1952 to 1962 he served in the State Senate of Virginia. He was lieutenant-governor of Virginia from 1962 to 1966. During the 26 years he held public office, he ran seventeen times and was never defeated.</p><p>His first election as governor in November 1965, came after he had received the Democratic nomination without opposition.</p><p>During his administration from 1966 to 1970, he became known as \"Virginia's Education Governor,\" taking the lead in upgrading education at every level from kindergarten through graduate school. Initiated and developed during his first term was the State's system of community colleges, two-year colleges offering occupational-technical and liberal arts training at minimum tuition. Salary increases and other improved benefits were granted teachers and faculty members. State aid to kindergartens, summer schools and classes for the handicapped encouraged broader opportunities throughout Virginia, and a number of other innovations were made in the public schools and higher education. The momentum followed a series of governor's conferences on education early in the administration. He persuaded the General Assembly to enact the Retail Sales Tax which was the first new broad-based tax passed in Virginia in more than one hundred years.</p><p>He continued and enlarged the emphasis on industrial development begun by his predecessor, Governor Harrison. He led the first two foreign trade missions and engaged in other efforts designed to attract high caliber new industry to Virginia and to encourage expansion by firms already located in the State. He saw industrial development and education as the principal means of continuing progress in Virginia.</p><p>During his tenure, Virginia made major strides also in water and air pollution control, port and park development, interstate, arterial and other highway construction, highway safety, mental health and other areas of State concern.</p><p>A blue ribbon commission appointed by Godwin proposed the State's first constitutional revision in forty years. The result was approved overwhelmingly by the voters. He also proposed the first general obligation bond issue in this century and led the campaign in which Virginia's voters approved it by a margin of more than two to one.</p><p>As governor he served as chairman of the Southern Regional Education Board, Vice Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference and as a member of the Executive Committee of the Democratic Governors Conference and the National Governors' Conference. He also served as Chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission.</p><p>After serving as governor from 1966 to 1970, he returned home and became a Director of Standard Brands, Inc., Norfolk and Western Railway Company, Union Camp Corporation, Virginia Real Estate Investment Trust, and Dan River, Inc. and served as a member of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors of Virginia National Bank. He was also on the Board of Directors of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation.</p><p>He resigned all of these posts after being elected governor a second time in November 1973, the first man ever twice elected by the people in Virginia to serve as Chief Executive. He was elected as the Republican nominee after being unopposed in their State Convention. He remains the only candidate in the country ever to win gubernatorial elections in the same state on both Democrat and Republican tickets.</p><p>During his second term as governor, he faced a series of crises of major proportions. The Arab oil embargo of late 1973 depressed the State's economy and the State revenues. As governor he ordered reduction of State spending by more than $200 million to keep the budget in balance and, as the economy improved later in his administration, he left a sizable surplus in the budget for his successor. Godwin dealt with the crises of shortages of gasoline, natural gas and fuel oil, the problem of Kepone, ten major floods and seven minor ones and the most serious drought in fifty years occurred in the last year of his administration which caused 115 of the State's 136 political jurisdictions to be designated as disaster areas. Despite these problems, Virginia's forward movement continued during his second term with major improvements in all areas, in job opportunities, and especially in our correctional programs and in public and higher education. He obtained approval from the General Assembly in 1977 for a Referendum on a $125 million General obligation Bond Program, largely earmarked for education and corrections, and again led the campaign which resulted in overwhelming approval for all five bond issues presented to the voters.</p><p>His leadership as governor was evidenced everywhere. Virginia's noted Pulitzer Prize winner and editor, Virginius Dabney, wrote that: \"His two terms combine to form a series of constructive advances for the Commonwealth that are unsurpassed in the long history of Virginia's governors.\"</p><p>As governor from 1974 to 1978, he was Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference, a member of the Executive Committees of the National Governors' Conference and the Republican Governors' Conference. He was Chairman for the second time of the Southern Regional Education Board and Vice President of the Council of State Governments.</p><p>Godwin again returned to his home in Suffolk in January 1978, and served as a consultant to management and a member of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors of the Virginia National Bank. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of Union Camp Corporation, Standard Brands, Inc. and the Royster Company.</p><p>Married to the former Katherine Thomas Beale, Governor Godwin lived in Suffolk where for many years he owned and operated the 500-acre family farm. He has been active in the Oakland Christian Church, where he taught the Men's Bible Class for more than twenty-five years, and engaged in numerous community activities. He was a 33rd degree Mason, past president of Ruritan National, and a member of Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Delta Phi, the Raven Society and Sigma Phi Epsilon. He was the recipient of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce's Distinguished Service Award, the Virginia National Guard's Distinguished Service Medal, the Virginia Education Association's citation as \"Virginia's Education Governor,\" the Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Service from the old Dominion Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America, the Centennial Medal from Hampton Institute, the Virginians of Maryland Medal, the FFA State Farmer Medal, also twice received a First Citizen's Award from Suffolk and Nansemond County, and the Colgate Whitehead Darden, Jr. Award from Norfolk State College, an award exemplifying highest caliber of statesmanship and interest in education in the Commonwealth. Virginia Military Institute has given him its New Market Medal, the highest award made by V.M.I.</p><p>On January 30, 1999, Mills E.

Novik (1903 - 1996), an early pioneer in radio, is credited with being one of the first people to understand the potential that radio had for public service and education, especially with regard to the emerging labor movement throughout the U.S. in the early part of the 20th century. Born in Nevel, Russia, Novik emigrated to New York City’s lower East Side with his family, and, as a teenager, became active in socialist politics. In 1918, he worked for anti-war activist Scott Nearing, who was opposing the Republican Fiorello La Guardia for Congress. In a 1989 The New Yorker interview, Novik said that this was when he first saw the future mayor, for whom he would work 20 years later as station manager of WNYC. ",

He came to the United States when he was eleven years old with his mother and his two younger brothers. It was in New York City where the family settled that Novik first met his father who had come to the United States years earlier. He was educated at a Yeshiva in the city but after graduating decided that he did not want to continue his religious education so at the age of fourteen he was sent to public school.</p><p>At this time Novik became involved with the social-political changes of 1917 engendered by the Russian Revolution. He headed a local chapter of the Young People's Socialist League while he was working at the Daily Record, a newspaper covering issues relating to the manufacture of clothing. He then received a scholarship to the Rand School which Novik described as a \"right-wing socialist school of learning\". During this time he became very involved in the socialist movement, starting a magazine called The Monthly Free Youth and serving as its editor.</p><p>In the early twenties Novik became involved with the Discussion Guild, arranging lectures and debates of well known writers and lecturers. The first speaker he engaged was noted British philosopher Bertrand Russell, who subsequently asked for Novik to represent him in future United States engagements. Through his work with the Discussion Guild Novik also became the manager for Clarence Darrow.</p><p>Novik entered the field of broadcasting in 1932 when he was asked to take over the management of the radio station WEVD in New York. He served as associate manager and program director. It was during this period that he founded the University of the Air.</p><p>Novik entered the field of broadcasting in 1932 when he was asked to take over the management of radio station WEVD in New York. It was during this time that he also founded the University of the Air. He was recruited by New York mayor Fiorello LaGuardia to run radio station WNYC. Novik declined until Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938. He realized it was more important now to keep democracy over the airwaves than to promote socialism and labor interests as he was doing at WEVD. He became director of communications at WNYC (1938-1946) and it while it was at this position that he coined the term \"Public Broadcasting.\" It was also during this time that he became involved in the genesis of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. Novik claimed he was one of the seven men who met in Ames, Iowa in 1939 to plan the permanent organization of this association. He then served as its first executive secretary from 1941 to 1948. Subsequently, Novik was involved in buying or establishing radio stations in Detroit, Cleveland, and the New York area.</p><p>After leaving WNYC in 1946 Novik helped establish radio stations in Detroit and Cleveland. In 1950 he bought the station WLIB in New York on which he established negro programming. He kept this station for 5 years, selling it to his brother Harry in 1955 when he then bought the Italian station WOV. He kept the Italian language format at WOV during his ownership but upon selling this station in 1959 this format was abandoned by the new owners.</p><p>Novik maintained a long relationship with the labor movement, serving as a communications consultant for the American Federation of Labor and later for the merged American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). His career also included some presidential appointments. In 1952 President Truman appointed him to be delegate to the UNESCO conference in Paris. In 1953 he participated in the UNESCO London conference on TV, advising Europeans on how to establish television stations. He was also selected by President Kennedy to serve on the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information in 1962. President Johnson reappointed him to that body.</p><p>Morris S. Novik died in 1996.</p><citation>From the guide to the Morris S. Novik Papers, 1940-1992, 1949-1964, (Mass Media and Culture)</citation></biogHist>",

Established in 1978, Hot Rize has appeared on national radio and TV shows, and has toured most of the United States, as well as Japan, Europe and Australia. Hot Rize started performing January 18, 1978, with Tim O'Brien on mandolin and fiddle, Pete Wernick on banjo, Charles Sawtelle on bass and Mike Scap on guitar. Scap left the band with Nick Forster (electric bass) joining in April, thereby allowing Sawtelle to switch to acoustic guitar. That established the four-man line-up that lasted over 20 years: O'Brien on mandolin, fiddle and lead vocals, Forster on electric bass, harmony vocals, and emcee work, Sawtelle, on guitar and occasional lead vocals, and Wernick as \"Dr. Banjo\".

      "description": "The Eastman Kodak Company (referred to simply as Kodak /ˈkoʊdæk/) is an American public company that produces various products related to its historic basis in analogue photography. The company is headquartered in Rochester, New York, and is incorporated in New Jersey. Kodak provides packaging, functional printing, graphic communications, and professional services for businesses around the world. Its main business segments are Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Micro 3D Printing and Packaging, Software and Solutions, and Consumer and Film. It is best known for photographic film products. Kodak was founded by George Eastman and Henry A. Strong on May 23, 1892. During most of the 20th century, Kodak held a dominant position in photographic film. The company's ubiquity was such that its \"Kodak moment\" tagline entered the common lexicon to describe a personal event that deserved to be recorded for posterity. Kodak began to struggle financially in the late 1990s, as a result of the decline in sales of photographic film and its slowness in moving to digital photography, despite developing the first self-contained digital camera. As a part of a turnaround strategy, Kodak began to focus on digital photography and digital printing, and attempted to generate revenues through aggressive patent litigation. ",

Dept. of Special Collections and University Archives.)</citation><p>In March of 1946, Lewis Hill, Eleanor McKinney and others began discussing the need for non-commercial, educational, cultural radio in the San Francisco Bay area. Frustrated with commercial radio, which they perceived as narrow in scope and rushed in delivery, Lewis Hill and this small group of people founded the Pacifica Foundation. Nearly three years after its incorporation date, Pacifica's first station, Berkeley's KPFA, went on the air.</p><p>From the station's beginning audience support was quite strong. Volunteers and donations arrived very soon after KPFA began airing, although more volunteers and more money were always needed. Pacifica was granted tax exemption on the basis of being an educational institution, and this also helped with the problems inherent in raising funds from listeners.</p><p>As Pacifica's first station, KPFA was the first listener-supported radio enterprise. The goal behind this revolutionary ideas was to serve as a grass roots forum; to support diversity, freedom of speech, to be funded by listeners and to program according to their interests and needs, not those of a corporate sponsor. These ideals were supported by the programming style at Pacifica. Examples of this practice were allowing programs to be as long or short as would be appropriate for the subject (not cutting them off to fit into tight commercial schedules), using informal speech style in order to avoid any alienation associated with more formal speech, etc.</p><p>Much of this idealism that was so identified with Pacifica was a result of the influence of Lewis Hill, the prime mover of the organization. Hill was a pacifist, who above all else, felt that communication, especially via the arts such as music, drama and literature, could form bonds among people. He also considered discussion of science, religion and philosophy ways to form such bonds, and address the quality of the human spirit. Hill believed that open controversy concerning concerning these and other such realms was a natural and necessary part of learning. As a result, Pacifica encouraged the broadcasting of differing points of view. Over the years, this dedication to freedom of expression created conflicts not only with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but with the Senate (1963 investigation concerning suspected Communist infiltration) and the FBI as well. In spite of a series of investigations and many complaints from listeners who were offended by their seeming lack of discrimination in programming, Pacifica stations did not lose their licenses. In fact, they set precedents concerning freedom of speech in broadcasting, from which communication media have benefited since.</p><p>Lewis Hill's vision set the stage for Pacifica and its open door programming policy. His time with the Foundation was not without problems, however. Between 1952 and 1954, KPFA experienced management related problems as a result of the clashing of the founding group's goals and new staff members' ideals. Hill resigned in 1952, and several other workers associated with the station's beginning left in protest of Hill's absence. The new management struggled, and in 1954, Hill returned.</p><p>Hill's suicide in 1954 shocked both KPFA staff and listeners. Because of his central role in creating the essence and style of the station, it was unclear how Pacifica would be affected. Instead of losing sight of Hill's vision, Pacifica began realizing plans to expand into other communities, and four stations have been added: KPFK, Los Angeles, 1959; WBAI, New York, 1960; KPFT, Houston, 1970; and WPFW, Washington, DC, 1977. Many affiliate stations have signed on in addition to these core stations. As with KPFA, each of these core stations has struggled to address its audience thoughtfully. For various reasons, each has also encountered resistance from sections of the community it serves. For example, KPFT was bombed twice in its first years, and other stations have experienced internal disagreements.</p><p>Pacifica has a unique status in broadcasting history not only for being the first listener-supported radio station, but also for breaking ground in freedom of speech issues, and for taking the risk of providing controversial programming and points of view.</p><citation>From the guide to the Pacifica Foundation Records, 1946-1991, 1950-1980, (Mass Media and Culture)</citation></biogHist>",

Buck was born in Detroit, growing up in Corktown. He studied at Detroit Art Academy, which had been founded by Joseph Gies and Francis P. Paulus. He illustrated for music publishers Ted Snyder, Edward H. Pfeiffer, and Jerome H. Remick. His cover illustrations had a personal touch and showed art deco and art nouveau elements. Dean Cornwell called him \"the first artist I ever copied\". By 1910 Buck was writing lyrics for composer Dave Stamper; his first hit was \"Daddy has a Sweetheart, and Mother is her Name\". He wrote about 500 songs, including \"In the Cool of the Evening\", \"No Foolin'\", \"Garden of My Dreams\", \"Someone, Someday, Somewhere\", and \"Hello, 'Frisco\". After 1914 he gave up illustration due to his failing eyesight. ",

WKSU also reaches much of Greater Cleveland, and extends throughout Northeast Ohio with two low-power broadcast relay stations and four full-power repeaters. Owned by Kent State University, WKSU broadcasts a mix of public radio and classical music, and serves as the local affiliate for NPR, American Public Media, and Public Radio International. Besides a standard analog transmission, WKSU broadcasts over four HD Radio channels, and is available online. The WKSU studios are located on the campus of Kent State University, while the station transmitter is in Copley. Radio operations within Kent State University can be traced back to 1940 with the establishment of the Kent State Radio Workshop, a division of the university's School of Speech. The Radio Workshop entered into a partnership with WADC to air a series of 15-minute long radio dramas produced by the Workshop on Tuesday afternoons; this began on March 3, 1940 with the program Lunch Room Nocturne, performed at the WADC studios in Tallmadge. Studios were eventually constructed on the university campus for the Radio Workshop that were comparable to that of a licensed radio station; the Radio Workshop also assumed production of a weekly radio program by Kent State faculty members from WTAM in Cleveland, that program was also moved to WADC. One of the last programs offered on WADC was an adaptation of the play Arsenic and Old Lace by the university's theater department on November 31, 1942. ",

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States Senator from Wisconsin from 1957 to 1989, the longest term served by a Wisconsin senator. Proxmire was a member of the Senate Banking Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the Joint Economic Committee. In each of those committees he was an aggressive critic of wasteful government spending. While serving on the Joint Economic Committee, he exposed numerous instances of wasteful spending on military programs such as the C-5 aircraft and the F-16 fighter, and other government programs such as the supersonic aircraft.

      "description": "WCAU, virtual channel 10 (UHF digital channel 28), is an NBC owned-and-operated television station licensed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The station is owned by the NBC Owned Television Stations subsidiary of NBCUniversal, as part of a duopoly with Mount Laurel, New Jersey-licensed Telemundo owned-and-operated station WWSI (channel 62); NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of locally based media firm Comcast, owns both networks, along with regional sports network NBC Sports Philadelphia. WCAU and WWSI share studios within the Comcast Technology Center on Arch Street in Center City, with some operations remaining at their former main studio at the corner of City Avenue and Monument Road in Bala Cynwyd, along the Philadelphia–Montgomery county line. The two stations also share transmitter facilities in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia. In 1946, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin secured a construction permit for channel 10, naming its proposed station WPEN-TV after the newspaper's WPEN radio stations (950 AM, now WKDN, and 98.1 FM, later WCAU-FM and now WOGL). The picture changed dramatically in 1947, when The Philadelphia Record folded. The Bulletin inherited the Record's \"goodwill\", along with the rights to buy the radio station WCAU (1210 AM, now WPHT) and the original WCAU-FM (102.9 FM) from their longtime owners, brothers Isaac and Leon Levy. The Bulletin sold the less-powerful WPEN and WCAU-FM, with the latter being renamed WPEN-FM (it is now WMGK). The Bulletin kept its FM station, renaming it WCAU-FM to match its new AM sister. The newspaper also kept its construction permit for channel 10, renaming it WCAU-TV. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>The Co-operative Printing Society was formed in Manchester as the North of England Co-operative Printing Society in 1869 by a group of printers, some of whom had worked for the Manchester Guardian. £1 shares were made available to the public and when £1,000 had been raised, the business commenced operation as letterpress printers and stationers, also undertaking bookbinding, ruling, lithography and other printing work.</p><p>The Co-operative Newspaper Society was formed in 1871 and registered as a co- operative. Its members were co-operative societies in the UK. The Society was formed to publish the first national newspaper of the co-operative movement, called the Co operative News and published weekly from September 1871 becoming a bi-weekly newspaper in 2006. Earlier journals had been published by individuals and changed their subject coverage according to the changing interests of their publisher. This was the first time that co-operative societies had come together to produce their own newspaper, an independent periodical, not tied to any particular organisation or section of the co-operative sector. The Co-operative News has always been based in Manchester and was printed by the Co-operative Printing Society. Scotland had its own Newspaper Society and its own newspaper, the Scottish Co operator which was published from 1893 to 1974 when it merged with the Co-operative News.</p><p>Following campaigns in the early 1880s the Co-operative News began a Women's Corner in January 1883, which is credited with leading to the creation of the Women's Co-operative Guild, one of the oldest women's organisations in the UK.</p><p>Following the recommendations of a Survey Committee, the English and Scottish Co-operative Newspaper Societies amalgamated in 1921 under the name of the National Co operative Publishing Society. There was a further name change in 1935 to the Co-operative Press.</p><p>The publications were, with the exception of Millgate Monthly (a cultural magazine) aimed at a co-operative public. The desire within the co-operative movement for a mainstream newspaper led to the purchase in 1929 of Reynolds News, a Sunday newspaper originally of the chartist movement and with a long radical tradition. Declining sales of the Reynolds News caused a change in name to Sunday Citizen in 1962 and the newspaper ceased publication in 1967.</p><p>In September 1971, the Co-operative Press took over Birmingham Printers, which had been registered as a co-operative society in 1902. In 1970 it was agreed that the Co-operative Printing Society would became part of the Co-operative Press, this was effective from June 1972.</p><p>Traden Publications was a joint venture between the Co operative Press and Leyden Publishing to publish a free distribution newspaper for the Greater Manchester area, formed in 1972 and wound up in 1974.</p><list><item>Bamford, W M (1921) Our Fifty Years 1871-1921: A Jubilee Souvenir of the Co-operative News Manchester: National Co operative Publishing Society Mercer</item><item>T W (1930) Sixty Years of Co-operative Printing 1869 1929 Manchester: Co-operative Printing Society</item><item>Bonner, A (1970) British Co-operation Second edition.

      "description": "Claude Denson Pepper (September 8, 1900 – May 30, 1989) was an American politician of the Democratic Party, and a spokesman for left-liberalism and the elderly. He represented Florida in the United States Senate from 1936 to 1951 and the Miami area in the United States House of Representatives from 1963 until 1989. Born in Chambers County, Alabama, Pepper established a legal practice in Perry, Florida after graduating from Harvard Law School. After serving a single term in the Florida House of Representatives, Pepper won a 1936 special election to succeed Senator Duncan U. Fletcher. Pepper became one of the most prominent liberals in Congress, supporting legislation such as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After World War II, Pepper's conciliatory views towards the Soviet Union and opposition to President Harry Truman's 1948 re-nomination engendered opposition within the party. Pepper lost the 1950 Senate Democratic primary to Congressman George Smathers and returned to private legal practice the following year. ",

Owned by the University of Houston System, it is sister to National Public Radio (NPR) member station KUHF (88.7 FM). The two stations share studios and offices in the Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting on the campus of the University of Houston. KUHT's transmitter is located near Missouri City, in unincorporated northeastern Fort Bend County. In addition, the station leased some of its studio operations to Tegna-owned CBS affiliate KHOU (channel 11) from August 2017 to February 2019 when the latter's original studios were inundated by Hurricane Harvey. KUHT also serves as the default PBS member station to the neighboring Beaumont–Port Arthur and Victoria markets (the latter along with KLRN in San Antonio) as they do not have their own PBS station. It is available on cable and satellite providers in both markets, although Lake Charles member station and Louisiana Public Broadcasting outlet KLTL-TV is carried by some cable providers in the extreme eastern areas of the Beaumont–Port Arthur market.

The facility is located in Lemont, Illinois, outside of Chicago, and is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the Midwest. Argonne had its beginnings in the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, formed in part to carry out Enrico Fermi's work on nuclear reactors for the Manhattan Project during World War II. After the war, it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946. In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the United States' nuclear navy, and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994, the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and renewable energy, environmental sustainability, supercomputing, and national security.

The University evolved through three stages before becoming the University of Kentucky in 1916: the Agriculture and Mechanical College of Kentucky University, 1865-78, a private, denominational institution in Lexington created by an act of the legislature on February 22, 1865; the Agriculture and Mechanical College of Kentucky, 1878-1908; and State University, Lexington, 1908-1916. A statute in 1916 changed the name to University of Kentucky. The new president took up the investigating committee's recommendation to write a constitution, which provided for a faculty-administration university senate. A graduate school was established in 1924. Among the new buildings was a central library. Enrollment doubled the first year after World War I and doubled again in the 1920s, totaling 4,992 in 1932, when the impact of the Depression was greatest. Emphasis upon nonstate funding continued. In 1988-89 $60 million in research grants and contracts and $22 million in developmental gifts were awarded.WBKY established itself at 91.3 in the new FM band in 1947 making it the first FM college radio station in the United States. The broadcast facilities and transmitter were located in McVey Hall on the University of Kentucky's main campus. The station was on the air nightly for three hours, every evening, five nights each week. In 1971, WBKY became a charter member of National Public Radio.

The band featured harmonica, kazoo, fiddle and mandolin or banjolin, backed by guitar, piano, washboard, washtub bass and jug. They played slow blues, pop songs, humorous songs and upbeat dance numbers with jazz and string band flavors. The band made the first commercial recordings in Memphis, Tennessee, and recorded more sides than any other prewar jug band. Beginning in 1926, African-American musicians in the Memphis area grouped around the singer, songwriter, guitarist, and harmonica player Will Shade (also known as Son Brimmer or Sun Brimmer). The personnel of the band varied from day to day, with Shade booking gigs and arranging recording sessions. The band was as a training ground for musicians who would go on to make careers of their own. ",

      "description": "The American Association of School Administrators (AASA), founded in 1865, is the professional organization for more than 14,000 educational leaders across the United States. AASA's members are chief executive officers and senior-level administrators from school districts in every region of the country, in rural, urban, and suburban settings. AASA's mission is to support and develop effective school system leaders who are dedicated to the highest quality public education for all children. On April 1, 2014, the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress) was introduced into the United States House of Representatives, where it passed on May 7, 2014. The bill would amend and reauthorize both the Charter School Programs and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Initiatives under Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 through fiscal year 2020 and combine them into a single authorization. This is intended to streamline and improve the grants process and increase the funding for these programs from $250 million to $300 million. The AASA opposed the bill, arguing that the bill did not have sufficient provisions in it to make sure tax dollars were being spent correctly, although they conceded the bill was an improvement over current law.

      "description": "Russell Billiu Long (November 3, 1918 – May 9, 2003) was an American Democratic politician and United States Senator from Louisiana from 1948 until 1987. Because of his seniority, he advanced to chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, serving for fifteen years, from 1966 to 1981, during the implementation of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and War on Poverty programs. Long also served as Assistant Majority Leader (Senate Majority Whip) from 1965 to 1969. The son of Rose McConnell Long and Huey Long, notable Louisiana governor and U.S. senator, Russell Long served during the administrations of eight U.S. presidents, from Truman to Reagan. According to biographer Bob Mann, Long \"became a leading voice for the plight of the elderly, the disabled, the working poor and the middle class.\" Long quietly wielded enormous power in the Senate and shaped some of the most significant tax legislation of the twentieth century. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Long held jurisdiction over 100 percent of all federal revenue and 40 percent of all government spending, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, welfare and food assistance programs, foreign trade, and tariffs. In 1980 he was voted the most effective chairman and most effective debater by his colleagues in a US News and World Report survey. In a 1982 survey, Long was voted the most influential Democrat by his Senate colleagues. The Wall Street Journal once called him \"the fourth branch of government.\" Upon his retirement in 1987, Long had a 75 percent approval rating among Louisiana voters. ",

He was a Tony Award winning actor and was a four-time nominee for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Rains was considered to be \"one of the screen's great character stars\" who was, according to the All-Movie Guide, \"at his best when playing cultured villains\". During his lengthy career, he was greatly admired by many of his acting colleagues, such as Bette Davis, Vincent Sherman, Ronald Neame, Albert Dekker, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, Charles Laughton and Richard Chamberlain.

It offers more than 50 undergraduate majors across the arts, sciences, and engineering, as well as Physician Assistant, Psychology, Clinical Mental Health Counseling, and Athletic training graduate programs. Its campus encompasses approximately three city blocks next to downtown Marietta and enrolls 1,200 full-time students. Marietta College began as the Muskingum Academy, in 1797, which was the birth of higher education in Ohio. In April 1797, which was only nine years after Ohio had been settled, a committee of Marietta citizens, led by General Rufus Putnam (the \"Father of Ohio\"), met to establish a college. The Muskingum Academy, completed late that year, became the first institution of its kind in the Northwest Territory, providing “classical instruction ... in the higher branches of an English education.” Its first instructor was David Putnam, a 1793 Yale graduate.

The Temple University Board of Trustees holds the station's license. The broadcast tower used by the station is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia at (40°02′30.1″N 75°14′10.1″W﻿ / ﻿40.041694°N 75.236139°W﻿ / 40.041694; -75.236139). WRTI began in 1948 as an AM carrier current station. It was founded by John Roberts, professor emeritus of communications at Temple and long-time anchorman at WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV). He helped found the School of Communications and Theater at Temple. The call letters stood for \"Radio Training Institute.\" In 1952, the station received an FM transmitter, receiving a full license to cover the FM facility in 1953. After years of serving as a student laboratory, WRTI-AM signed off for good in 1968. WRTI-FM switched from block programming to an all-jazz format in 1969 after Philadelphia's commercial classical music station, WFLN, changed formats. ",

He went on to distribute a new product, propane gas, until selling his business in 1956.</p><p>Fannin was elected Governor of Arizona in 1958 and re-elected in 1960 and 1962. During his terms, Arizona increased sales taxes to support its public school system, established junior colleges, improved state universities, and constructed its first medical school in Tucson. When Barry Goldwater left the Senate to run for President in 1964, Fannin won his seat. In Congress, Fannin served on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Navajo-Hopi Indian Administration Committee, the Aging Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Budget Committee. He was a particular opponent of organized labor, denouncing industrial strikes and fighting to maintain the clause in the Taft-Hartley Act that allowed individual states to decide whether to mandate union membership for workers in unionized shops. He was also involved with environmental issues, supporting increased limitations on strip mining and working to complete the Central Arizona Project.</p><p>In 1976, Fannin chose not to run for re-election for personal reasons. He returned to Arizona, where he continued to lobby for energy issues and served on the Central Arizona Water Conservation District Board.

He soon became involved with his brother in the Fannin Gas and Supply Company, a petroleum and equipment distribution company doing business in the Southwest and Mexico.</p><p>A conservative Republican, Fannin ran for governor in 1958 and although the majority of registered voters at that time were Democrats, he won by over 30,000 votes. Fannin later ran two more times and won. As Governor, Fannin worked to attract industry to the state, fought for better schools and the creation of a junior college system. During his tenure, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to allocate the Colorado River between Arizona and California. This decision led to the creation of the Central Arizona Project. In 1959, Fannin created the Arizona Mexico West Coast Trade Commission to facilitate economic and social interaction.

      "description": "Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) is an organization with a membership of over one thousand non-profit, education-affiliated radio stations and webcasters. Founded in 1940, IBS is headquartered in New Windsor, New York, with a legal office in Washington, D.C. In addition to providing support for establishing and operating noncommercial radio and webcast operations, it frequently represents its members with FCC negotiations, copyright issues, and litigation. A majority of the over 2,500 educational radio stations do not affiliate nationally, but of the ones that do, IBS represents over 90%. The organization is also a member of the National Association of Broadcasters. The entire staff of IBS is composed of unpaid volunteers.[citation needed] ",

      "description": "Lillian Eugenia Smith (December 12, 1897 – September 28, 1966) was a writer and social critic of the Southern United States, known most prominently for her best-selling novel Strange Fruit (1944). A white woman who openly embraced controversial positions on matters of race and gender equality, she was a southern liberal unafraid to criticize segregation and work toward the dismantling of Jim Crow laws, at a time when such actions virtually guaranteed social ostracism. Smith was born on December 12, 1897, to a prominent family in Jasper, Florida, the seventh of nine children. Her life as the daughter of a middle-class civic and business leader took an abrupt turn in 1915 when her father lost his turpentine mills. The family was not without resources, however, and decided to relocate to their summer residence in the mountains of Clayton, Georgia, where her father had previously purchased property and operated the Laurel Falls Camp for Girls since 1920.

Lillian Eugenia Smith was born into a large, respectable, prosperous family in Jasper, Florida, on December 12, 1897. When the family business collapsed in 1915, her family moved to their cottage in Clayton, in Rabun County, and started Laurel Falls Girls Camp. Smith studied at Piedmont College in Demorest (1915-16) and then left to help run the family camp.

From as early as the 1930s, she argued that Jim Crow was evil (\"Segregation is spiritual lynching,\" she said) and that it leads to social and moral retardation. Smith gained national recognition - and regional denunciation - by writing Strange Fruit (1944), a bold novel of illicit interracial love. Five years later she hurled another thunderbolt against racism in Killers of the Dream (1949), a brilliant psychological and autobiographical work warning that segregation corrupted the soul; removed any possibility of freedom and decency in the South; and had serious implications for women and children in particular in their developing views of sex, their bodies, and their innermost selves. From her home in Clayton, atop Old Screamer Mountain, she openly convened interracial meetings, and she toured the South, talking to people from all races and classes. She was unsparing in her criticisms of \"liberals\" and \"moderates\" like Atlanta's famed Ralph McGill and refused to join groups such as the Southern Regional Council until it could oppose segregation as well as racism. In her own psyche she struggled with intensely conflicting desires: to write creatively, following her heart's passions, or to respond to her stern conscience and the intellectual voice of duty. New Georgia Encyclopedia http://newgeorgiaencyclopedia.com (Retrieved February 20, 2009)</p><p>Norman Cousins was an American essayist and editor, long associated with the Saturday Review. From 1942-1972 he was editor of the Saturday Review. Following his appointment as executive editor in 1940, he introduced essays that drew a connection between literature and current events, whereupon circulation of the magazine increased 50 percent. Unafraid to criticize, Cousins was outspoken and his articles sometimes bitter. At times he criticized the U.S. government, but he felt strongly that a unique potential for greatness existed in America; he wrote The Good Inheritance: the Democratic Chance (1942) to explore this idea. Cousins felt that modern problems stemmed from the absence of a collective voice and from Americans' inability to see their social and political dilemmas clearly. In 1972 Cousins left the Saturday Review but returned the following year. In 1980 he was named \"editor emeritus.\" In his final years he was adjunct professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral science at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Alex Inkeles was born on March 4, 1920 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland, though lived in a neighborhood that predominantly consisted of Sicilians. He attended Cornell University for his bachelor's degree in 1941 and master's degree in 1946. While at Cornell, he took several high-level courses in the Russian language. After World War II he attended Columbia University for his PhD, graduating in 1949. ",

He was influential in developing and promoting the literary style known as magical realism. Bontempelli graduated from the University of Turin in 1903. He taught elementary school for seven years, doing his writing on the side, but abandoned teaching for journalism when he could not secure a position at a secondary school. He served as a war correspondent during World War I. After the war, he settled in Milan and became interested in the literary styles of futurism and magical realism. In 1926, he, along with Curzio Malaparte, founded the journal \"900\".

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Massimo Bontempelli was an Italian writer and composer. Influenced by the Futurists and by Pirandello's brand of surrealism, he was primarily a proponent of magic realism, a genre that he allied to Italian fascism. He served as cultural liaison and propagandist for the fascist regime abroad and was the national secretary of the fascist writers' union from 1927 to 1928. After World War II he became a socialist and won a seat in the Italian senate, but the senate nullified the election because of his fascist past.</p><citation>From the description of Bontempelli papers, 1865-1991. (Getty Research Institute). WorldCat record id: 80461371</citation><p><span>Biographical/Historical Note</span></p><p>Massimo Bontempelli was born in 1878, the son of a railroad engineer whose work obliged the family to move frequently. He attended secondary school in Milan and university in Turin, where he graduated in both philosophy and letters. After teaching elementary school for a number of years and failing to win a position teaching Italian in secondary school, he turned to magazine editing in 1910. During WWI he was a war correspondent, reporting from the front, and then an artillery official (1917-1918).</p><p>While teaching elementary school, Bontempelli wrote poetry, stories and plays, producing a new volume every year or two, as he would continue to do for most of his career. After the war he returned to Milan, where he came into contact with the avant-garde and consequently reinvented himself, refuting his previous work and the late 19th century style that had characterized it. At forty years of age, he began editing futurist magazines and writing plays and stories that portrayed bizarre psychological conditions and uncanny situations. Along with the futurists, Pirandello, with whom Bontempelli was close friends, influenced work such as La vita intensa, La scacchiera davanti allo specchio, and Eva ultima .</p><p>In 1926, Bontempelli and Malaparte started the journal '900, Cahiers d'Italie et d'Europe, which was edited by an international group and which served as a venue for such writers as James Joyce, Virigina Woolf, and Blaise Cendrars. In '900 Bontempelli found a forum for his cultural theory, Novecentismo, which posited three stages in human civilization: the first, the classical period, ended with the coming of Christ; the second, the romantic, began with the Sermon on the Mount and ended with WWI; the third, both anti-classical and anti-romantic, was just beginning and would demand the complete political and cultural renewal that Fascism proposed. Bontempelli believed that the role of the writer within the new order should be that of mythographer, the producer of myths and fables for mass society. But while writers should employ \"magic realism\" to inspire readers to acceptance of the new order, they should not submit to control or censorship of their imaginations.</p><p>Bontempelli was the national secretary of the fascist writers' union from 1927-1928; in 1930 he became a member of the Academy of Italy. Until the late 1930s he served, along with his companion Paola Masino, as a cultural liason and propagandist for the fascist regime abroad, lecturing frequently on Italian cultural figures. During this period he also produced his \"mature\" novels and plays ( Il figlio di due madri ; Vita e morte di Adria e i suoi figli ; La fame ; Nembo ) written according to his theories, and became one of the best-selling authors in Italy. In 1938 he came into conflict with the regime over his refusal of a university chair vacated due to application of racial laws. He was expelled from the party and suspended from literary activity for one year. Reinstated, he began writing a popular column for Tempo, entitled \"Colloqui,\" which ran until 1943.</p><p>After WWII, Bontempelli aligned himself with the political left and ran for senator. He won, but the Senate nullified his election because of his fascist past. During the 1950s his health declined along with his literary reputation, despite the publication of a collection of essays on music and one of previously published stories, L'amante fedele, which won the 1953 Strega prize. He died in 1960.</p><citation>From the guide to the Massimo Bontempelli papers, 1865-1991, (Getty Research Institute)</citation></biogHist>",

He attended public schools in Portland, Oregon, then went on to study psychology at the University of Oregon and Stanford University.</p><p>Prior to coming to the University of Michigan Campbell taught at Northwestern University. In addition, he received a postdoctoral fellowship to study in the Department of Anthropology at Cambridge University, then with the coming of war left to spend several months conducting a field study of the black population of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. Early in 1942 he joined Rensis Likert and a staff of social scientists in Washington, D.C., to work providing information to federal agencies on various social and economic problems that had arisen as a result of the war. His title was Assistant Head of the Division of Program Surveys of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics.</p><p>Campbell was one of a group of scholars who came out of the Division of Program Surveys dedicated to establishing a new kind of survey research facility in a university setting. Given encouragement by the University of Michigan, Campbell, Likert and others came to Ann Arbor in 1946 to set up the Survey Research Center, one of the units out of which the Institute for Social Research ultimately evolved. He headed the SRC from 1948 to 1970, at which time he succeeded Rensis Likert as ISR director.</p><p>Campbell was most closely associated with survey research in three areas: political behavior, racial attitudes, and quality of life studies. He directed a long-time study in political elections that began with the presidential election of 1948. For this and later succeeding studies, Campbell became known as a nationally recognized expert in the field of political surveys.</p><p>During the 1960's and at the request of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the Survey Research Center undertook a study of race problems in fifteen major cities. Campbell and Howard Schuman were directors of the study which was undertaken early in 1968. Periodically thereafter, Campbell continued to monitor trends in racial attitudes by repeating parts of the study (usually every two years).</p><p>Campbell's third major interest was finding ways of conceptualizing and measuring the psychological quality of life. He began work in this area in 1968 with support from the Russell Sage Foundation.</p><p>In addition to his responsibilities at ISR, Campbell was Professor of Sociology and Psychology at the University and a lecturer in the Law School.

Based for five decades at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Paulu was the author of five books and dozens of articles on radio and television in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe. His work introduced American scholars and the interested public to broadcasting systems in Eastern and Western European countries where the role of the government and of advertising contrasted sharply with US practices. He taught and lectured widely in the US and Europe and held three appointments in the journalism department of Moscow State University, the first at a time when academic contacts between the US and the then - Soviet Union were rare and the last, when he was 81 years old, as the Soviet Union was collapsing.

The series was intended to bring renowned artists to FSCW. After FSCW became Florida State University (FSU), the FSU School of Music managed the series. However, in 1974 the FSU Artist Series Committee assumed control. Because of financial difficulties in the early 1990s, the Artist Series was briefly discontinued. The series was then entitled the \"Community Concerts in Tallahassee\" and included organizations outside the University. By the 1996-1997 season the Community Concerts in Tallahassee name was changed to the Artist Series.

During the late 1950s, for example, the calendars were published by the FSU Division of Publications. From the late 1960s through the 1990s, they were published by the Student Union, the Student Activities Office, the Leisure Program Office, and the Office of Public Relations and Special Events. Over the years, the calendar title changed. In the 1950s, it was called \"Campus Calendar.\" From the 1960s until the late 20th Century, it became \"Activities Schedule,\" \"Garnet and Gold Guide,\" and finally \"Activities Calendar\".</p><citation>From the description of Florida State University activities calendars, 1956-1976 (inclusive) (bulk 1965-1969).

The Seminole Tribe of Florida, formed in 1957, has since become an integral part of Florida's culture and history. As this collection shows, in the past, the American Indian Movement and several American Indian tribes, such as the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, have protested the practice by many athletic teams of using Native American mascots. The Seminole Tribe of Florida, however, has approved the portrayal of Chief Osceola and Renegade as FSU's official mascot. FSU has always enjoyed a close relationship with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, as shown by its respect and admiration for the Seminole people.</p><citation>From the description of Florida State University Seminole mascot files, 1949-2005 (inclusive) (bulk 1992-1995).

On May 15, 1947, the Florida State College for Women became a coeducational institution of university status, the Florida State University. The minutes reflect concerns resulting from this change. The inclusion of men students, growth of the student body, and change in status from a college to a university required appropriate and adequate housing, classroom space, and curricula for the University's current and future needs. The Planning Committee's work addressed these issues, establishing their priorities as the \"(1) Needs of the people of the state so far as higher education was concerned; (2) Cooperation with the University of Florida, Regional Education, etc.; (3) Desired functions of the University; and (4) Adequate financing\" (Minutes of April 9, 1948).</p><citation>From the guide to the Florida State University Planning Committee Minutes, March 26, 1948 - March 28, 1949, (Florida State University Libraries)</citation><p>In 1851 the Florida legislature established two seminaries.

      "description": "The Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO ) is an American orchestra based in Detroit, Michigan. Its primary performance venue is Orchestra Hall at the Max M. Fisher Music Center in Detroit's Midtown neighborhood. The orchestra's current president and chief executive officer is Anne Parsons, since 2004. Jader Bignamini is the current music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Leonard Slatkin, the previous music director, is the orchestra's current music director laureate. Neeme Järvi, music director from 1990 to 2005, is the orchestra's current music director emeritus. The DSO performed the first concert of its first subscription season at 8:00 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 19, 1887 at the Detroit Opera House. The conductor was Rudolph Speil. He was succeeded in subsequent seasons by a variety of conductors until 1900 when Hugo Kalsow was appointed and served until the orchestra ceased operations in 1910. The Detroit Symphony resumed operations in 1914 when ten Detroit society women each contributed $100 to the organization and pledged to find 100 additional subscribers. They soon hired a music director, Weston Gales, a 27-year-old church organist from Boston, who led the first performance of the reconstituted orchestra on February 26, 1914, again at the old Detroit Opera House.

      "description": "Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York (UTS) is a non-denominational Christian seminary in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, New York City. It is affiliated with neighboring Columbia University. Since 1928, the seminary has served as Columbia's constituent faculty of theology. In 1964, UTS also established an affiliation with the neighboring Jewish Theological Seminary of America. UTS is the oldest independent seminary in the United States and has long been known as a bastion of progressive Christian scholarship, with a number of prominent thinkers among its faculty or alumni. It was founded in 1836 by members of the Presbyterian Church in the USA, but was open to students of all denominations. In 1893, UTS rescinded the right of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to veto faculty appointments, thus becoming fully independent. In the 20th century, Union became a center of liberal Christianity. It served as the birthplace of the Black theology, womanist theology, and other theological movements. It houses the Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary, one of the largest theological libraries in the Western Hemisphere. ",

      "description": "The University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC) is a public research university in Kansas City, Missouri. UMKC is part of the University of Missouri System and one of only two member universities with a medical school. As of 2015, the university's enrollment exceeded 16,000 students. It is the largest university and third largest college in the Kansas City metropolitan area. It is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\". The school has its roots in the Lincoln and Lee University movement first put forth by the Methodist Church and its Bishop Ernest Lynn Waldorf in the 1920s. The proposed university (which was to honor Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee) was to be built on the Missouri–Kansas border at 75th and State Line Road, where the Battle of Westport (the largest battle west of the Mississippi River during the American Civil War) took place. The centerpiece of the school was to be a National Memorial marking the tomb of an unknown Union soldier and unknown Confederate soldier. Proponents of the school said it would be a location \"where North met South and East met West.\" The Methodist interest reflected the church's important role in the development of the Kansas City area through the Shawnee Methodist Mission which was the second capital of Kansas.

      "description": "WUOT (91.9 FM) is the National Public Radio member station in Knoxville, Tennessee. Owned by the University of Tennessee, it airs a mix of news, classical music and jazz, along with programming from NPR, American Public Media and Public Radio International. It primarily features classical music programming, but carries NPR news programs daily, as well as jazz music for ninety minutes every weeknight and all evening on Fridays and folk music Saturday evenings. Its studios are located in the Communications Building on the UT campus. On June 2, 1949, the University of Tennessee filed with the Federal Communications Commission for a construction permit to build a new noncommercial FM radio station in Knoxville. The idea to bring the university a radio station had been a campaign plank of future U.S. senator Howard Baker's campaign platform for student body president at UTK. The FCC approved the application a month later, at which time the university announced that it was building studios on the ground floor of Ayres Hall and had bought equipment from defunct radio station WKPB. WKPB had been a commercial station on 93.3 FM owned by the Knoxville Journal that broadcast from October 15, 1947 to April 15, 1949; the Journal, citing the uncertainty created by the advent of television, shuttered the station and sold its equipment to the university and its records to the general public. For a total of $16,000, the university had the equipment it needed to set up its own radio station. ",

He was best known for his study of post-Reconstruction America, a period he termed \"the nadir of American race relations\". In the late 1940s he was the chief advisor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on international affairs. He was professor emeritus of history at Howard University. Rayford Logan was born and raised in Washington, DC. He won a scholarship to Williams College, graduating in 1917. During the First World War he joined the U.S. Army, and served as a first lieutenant in the all-black 93rd infantry Division, which undertook operations with French troops. Once the war ended, Logan remained in France, absorbing both the culture and the language. He helped to co-ordinate the 2nd Pan-African Congress in Paris in 1921. He returned to the US in the early 1920s and began teaching at Virginia Union University, a historically black college in Richmond. ",

In 1934, Kellogg donated more than $66 million in Kellogg Company stock and other investments to the W. K. Kellogg Trust (equivalent to $1 billion in 2019 ). As with other endowments, the yearly income from this trust funds the foundation. In the early 21st century, the foundation is the seventh largest philanthropic foundation in the U.S. In 2005, the foundation reported that the total assets of the foundation and its trust were US$7.3 billion; about US$5.5 billion of this was in Kellogg Company stock. The foundation funded US$243 million in grants and programs in its 2005 fiscal year. 82% of this was spent in the United States; 9% in southern Africa; and 9% in Latin America and the Caribbean. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Michigan was among the first schools in the nation to formally incorporate instruction in the field of speech into its curriculum. The subject's inclusion was largely the result of Thomas C. Trueblood's work. In the later nineteenth century, Trueblood made his living traveling from university to university offering short courses in speech. He first came to Ann Arbor in 1884 and his six week course was so popular with students that he began to return for longer and longer residences. Finally, in 1889 he became a permanent faculty member of the University of Michigan. In 1892 the Department of Elocution and Oratory was created, with Trueblood as its sole member. Trueblood remained chair of the department until 1926.</p><p>Over the years the department's formal title changed frequently, reflecting the broad area of instruction that fell under its mantle. The original name was simplified to the Department of Oratory in 1908. Subsequent titles included Department of Public Speaking (1919-1927); Department of Speech (1927-1932); Department of Speech, Phonetics, and General Linguistics (1932); Department of Speech and General Linguistics (1932-1939); Department of Speech (1939-1972); and Department of Speech Communication and Theater (1972-1979). In 1979, as part of a major reorganization of several units, the Department of Speech Communication and Theater was formally eliminated. Elements of the department's program were relocated in two new units; the Department of Theatre and Drama and the Department of Communication.</p><citation>From the guide to the Dept. of Speech (University of Michigan) records, 1928-1978, (Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)</citation></biogHist>",

      "description": "The Chicago Sun-Times is a daily newspaper published in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is the flagship paper of the Sun-Times Media Group, and has the second largest circulation among Chicago newspapers, after the Chicago Tribune. The modern paper grew out of the 1948 merger of the Chicago Sun and the Chicago Daily Times. Journalists at the paper have received eight Pulitzer prizes, mostly in the 1970s; one recipient was film critic Roger Ebert (1975), who worked at the paper from 1967 until his death in 2013. Ownership of the paper has changed hands numerous times, including twice in the late 2010s. The Chicago Sun-Times claims to be the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the city. That claim is based on the 1844 founding of the Chicago Daily Journal, which was also the first newspaper to publish the rumor, now believed false, that a cow owned by Catherine O'Leary was responsible for the Chicago fire. The Evening Journal, whose West Side building at 17–19 S. Canal was undamaged, gave the Chicago Tribune a temporary home until it could rebuild. Though the assets of the Journal were sold to the Chicago Daily News in 1929, its last owner Samuel Emory Thomason also immediately launched the tabloid Chicago Daily Illustrated Times. ",

The first known radio activities at William & Mary occurred in the spring of 1956, when a group of students, using equipment purchased in their own financial initiative, broadcast a weak signal from the Chapman House. Although many students and some faculty were behind the effort, this early initiative failed due to lack of administrative backing, according to a letter to the editor by former WCWM Program Director Fred Schaffer (class of 1957) that was published in the Flat Hat, the William & Mary newspaper, on March 10, 1959.

Xerox is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut (having moved from Stamford, Connecticut, in October 2007), though it is incorporated in New York with its largest population of employees based around Rochester, New York, the area in which the company was founded. The company purchased Affiliated Computer Services for $6.4 billion in early 2010. As a large developed company, it is consistently placed in the list of Fortune 500 companies. On December 31, 2016, Xerox separated its business process service operations, essentially those operations acquired with the purchase of Affiliated Computer Services, into a new publicly traded company, Conduent. Xerox focuses on its document technology and document outsourcing business, and continues to trade on the NYSE. ",

      "description": "Hans Joachim Morgenthau (February 17, 1904 – July 19, 1980) was one of the major twentieth-century figures in the study of international relations. Morgenthau's works belong to the tradition of realism in international relations theory, and he is usually considered among the most influential realists of the post-World War II period. Morgenthau made landmark contributions to international relations theory and the study of international law. His Politics Among Nations, first published in 1948, went through five editions during his lifetime. Morgenthau also wrote widely about international politics and U.S. foreign policy for general-circulation publications such as The New Leader, Commentary, Worldview, The New York Review of Books, and The New Republic. He knew and corresponded with many of the leading intellectuals and writers of his era, such as Reinhold Niebuhr, George F. Kennan, Carl Schmitt and Hannah Arendt. At one point in the early Cold War, Morgenthau was a consultant to the U.S. Department of State when Kennan headed its Policy Planning Staff, and a second time during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations until he was dismissed by Johnson when he began to publicly criticize American policy in Vietnam. For most of his career, however, Morgenthau was esteemed as an academic interpreter of U.S. foreign policy. ",

Born February 17, 1904, in Coburg (Germany), died July 19, 1980, New York, NY (USA)</p><p>Educated at the universities of Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich, Morgenthau trained as a passed to bar and practiced in Munich from 1927 to 1930, when he became a teaching assistant at the University of Frankfurt. From 1931 to 1933 he served as acting president of the Frankfurt labor court. In 1932, he went also to Geneva to teach public law for a year, but because of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933, he stayed on until 1935. In 1935/36, he taught in Madrid, where he was professor of international law at the Madrid Institute of International and Economic Studies. Morgenthau immigrated to the United States in 1937 (naturalized 1943).</p><p>He served on the faculties of Brooklyn College (1937-39), the University of Kansas City (1939-43), and from 1943 to 1971 taught international politics at the University of Chicago. In 1950 he became the director of the Center for Study of American Foreign and Military Policy. From 1968 to 1974 he was professor of political science at the City College of New York. Furthermore Morgenthau taught at the New School for Social Research from 1974 to 1980 and also served as consultant to the U.S. Department of State and Defense, as well as commentator on U.S. current affairs.</p><p>Morgenthau was a predominant figure in the post-World War II effort to refocus the study of international relations on the observed regularities of human conduct, rather than the idealistic pursuit of abstract norms. This political realism gained wide influence with the publication of his Scientific Man vs. Power Politics (1947) and especially Politics among Nations (1949), a highly regarded study that presented a modern realist approach to international politics, which became the leading text in field. Central to Morgenthau's theory was the concept of power as the dominant goal in international politics and the definition of national interest in terms of power. He called for recognition of the nature and limits of power and for the use of traditional methods of diplomacy, including compromise.</p><p>A contributor to numerous scholarly periodicals and journals of opinion, Morgenthau was also the author of In Defense of the National Interest (1951), Dilemmas of Politics (1958), The Purpose of American Politics (1960), Politics in the Twentieth Century, 3 vol. (1962), and Truth and Power (1970). Many of Morgenthau's writings were translated into foreign languages.</p><p>Hans Morgenthau was married to Irma Morgenthau (neé Thormann). Their son Matthew was born in 1942, when Hans Morgenthau was 38 years old. In 1944, a daughter Susanna was born.</p><citation>From the guide to the Hans Morgenthau Collection, 1904-1980, (Leo Baeck Institute Archives)</citation></biogHist>",

She is best known for her 1943 bestselling book A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Smith was born Elisabeth Lillian Wehner on December 15, 1896 in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York to first-generation German-Americans John C. Wehner, a waiter, and Katherine (or Catherine) Hummel. She had a younger brother, William, and a younger sister, Regina. At the time of her birth the family was living at 207 Ewen Street (now Manhattan Avenue). When she was four, they were living at 227 Stagg Street, and would move several times to various tenements on Montrose Avenue and Hopkins Street before settling in a tenement on the top floor of 702 Grand Street. It was the Grand Street tenement that served as the setting for A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. ",

Its main campus spans 90 acres (36 ha) on Ward Circle, mostly in the Spring Valley neighborhood of Northwest D.C. AU was chartered by an Act of Congress in 1893 at the urging of Methodist bishop John Fletcher Hurst, who sought to create an institution that would promote public service, internationalism, and pragmatic idealism. AU broke ground in 1902, opened in 1914, and admitted its first undergraduates in 1925. Although affiliated with the United Methodist Church, religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission. American University has eight schools and colleges: the School of International Service, College of Arts and Sciences, Kogod School of Business, School of Communication, School of Professional and Extended Studies, School of Public Affairs, School of Education, and the Washington College of Law (WCL). It has over 160 programs, including 71 bachelor's degrees, 87 master's degrees, and 10 doctoral degrees, as well as JD, LLM, and SJD programs. AU's student body numbers over 13,000 and represents all 50 U.S. states and 141 countries; around a fifth of students are international. It is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\". ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Douglas James Cleverdon, bookseller and radio producer, was born on Jan. 17, 1903 in Bristol, England, the elder son of Thomas Silcox Cleverdon, master wheelwright, and his wife, Jane Louisa James. He was educated at Bristol grammar school and Jesus College, Oxford, where as an undergraduate he published his first catalogue of books, thus establishing his reputation as a lover of fine printing and illustrated books. In 1926 Cleverdon opened a bookshop in Charlotte Street, Bristol, and also began publishing, with a limited edition of Eric Gill's 'Art and love' appearing in 1927, and an edition of Coleridge's 'The rime of the ancient mariner' with 10 engravings on copper by David Jones appearing in 1929. The Great Depression brought an end to Cleverdon's publishing venture, but he continued to sell books until the end of the 1930s when he began working part-time for the BBC. In 1939 he became a west regional features producer, and in 1943 a features producer in London. Shortly before the Second World War Cleverdon met Elinor Nest Lewis, daughter of James Abraham Lewis, canon, of Cardiff, Wales. They wed in 1944, and during the course of their marriage had two daughters and three sons. Dec. 1942 saw the first broacast of 'The brains trust', an informational radio program which he created with Howard Thomas. It reached an audience of twelve million, which was at that time about 29% of the population of the United Kingdom. After a brief stint in 1945 as a BBC war correspondent in Burma, he began developing a series of radio portraits for the Third Programme. He dramatized David Jones's In Parenthesis (1948) and The Anathemata (1953), broadcast the poems of John Betjeman, Thom Gunn, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, Siegfried Sassoon, Stevie Smith and Wole Soyinka, and produced the work of Jacob Bronowski, David Garnett, Rose Macaulay, and Compton Mackenzie. In addition to producing programs of folk song with A. L. Lloyd and Alan Lomax, Cleverdon commissioned new music from Lennox Berkeley, Peter Racine Fricker, Alan Rawsthorne, Humphrey Searle, Mátyás Seiber and Aleksandr Tcherepnin. His most famous commission was Dylan Thomas's 'Under milk wood', first broadcast in 1954 with an all Welsh cast and starring Richard Burton. After retiring from the BBC in 1969, Cleverdon returned to publishing. Among the publications of his Clover Hill Editions were works of Michael Ayrton, David Jones, and Reynolds Stone. Douglas Cleverdon died on Oct. 1, 1987 at his home in London.</p><citation>From the description of The Cleverdon-Jones collection, 1972. (Georgetown University).

Lee's writing is known for blending traditional Chinese, supernatural and everyday Hong Kong elements into her narratives. Her works, Rouge, Farewell My Concubine and Green Snake, were adapted for films in the 1980s and 1990s, giving her greater international visibility. In those instances, Lee also co-wrote the screenplays. Her novels and essays have appeared in newspapers in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. ",

Founded by Bishop John Carroll in 1789 as Georgetown College, the university has grown to comprise ten undergraduate and graduate schools, among which are the School of Foreign Service, School of Business, Medical School, Law School, and a campus in Qatar. On a hill above the Potomac River, the school's main campus is identifiable by its flagship Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark. Georgetown is the oldest Catholic institution of higher education in the United States. The Jesuits have participated in the university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805. However, the university has always been governed independently of the church, and the majority of Georgetown students are not Catholic. ",

      "description": "William Orville Douglas (October 16, 1898 – January 19, 1980) was an American jurist and politician who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Douglas was confirmed at the age of 40, one of the youngest justices appointed to the court. His term, lasting 36 years and 211 days (1939–75), is the longest in the history of the Supreme Court. In 1975, Time magazine called Douglas \"the most doctrinaire and committed civil libertarian ever to sit on the court.\" After an itinerant childhood, Douglas attended Whitman College on a scholarship. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1925 and joined the Yale Law School faculty. After serving as the third chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Douglas was successfully nominated to the Supreme Court in 1939, succeeding Justice Louis Brandeis. He was among those seriously considered for the 1944 Democratic vice presidential nomination and was subject to an unsuccessful draft movement prior to the 1948 presidential election. Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975, and was succeeded by John Paul Stevens. Douglas holds a number of records as a Supreme Court justice, including the most opinions. ",

      "description": "Hubert Horatio Humphrey Jr. (May 27, 1911 – January 13, 1978) was an American politician who served as the 38th vice president of the United States from 1965 to 1969. He twice served in the United States Senate, representing Minnesota from 1949 to 1964 and 1971 to 1978. As a senator he was a major leader of modern liberalism in the United States. As President Lyndon Johnson's vice president, he supported the controversial Vietnam War. An intensely divided Democratic Party nominated him in the 1968 presidential election. He lost the election to Republican nominee Richard Nixon. Born in Wallace, South Dakota, Humphrey attended the University of Minnesota. In 1943, he became a professor of political science at Macalester College and ran a failed campaign for mayor of Minneapolis. He helped found the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) in 1944; the next year he was elected mayor of Minneapolis, serving until 1948 and co-founding the liberal anti-communist group Americans for Democratic Action in 1947. In 1948, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and successfully advocated for the inclusion of a proposal to end racial segregation in the 1948 Democratic National Convention's party platform. He was a leader of American liberalism, especially in supporting civil rights. Liberals split over his strong support for the Vietnam War. ",

      "description": "The LaSalle Quartet was a string quartet active from 1946 to 1987. It was founded by first violinist Walter Levin. The LaSalle's name is attributed to an apartment on LaSalle Street in Manhattan, where some of its members lived during the quartet's inception. The quartet played on a donated set of Amati instruments. The LaSalle Quartet was best known for its espousal of the Second Viennese School of Schoenberg, Berg and Webern, and of the European modernists who derived from that tradition, though they also performed standard classical and romantic literature. The Quartet gave the premiere of Witold Lutosławski's String Quartet in Stockholm in 1965. György Ligeti dedicated his Second String Quartet to the group, and they premiered it in Baden-Baden on December 14, 1969. The quartet has been credited with the \"Zemlinsky Renaissance,\" as Zemlinsky remained largely unknown until they performed his works. The quartet won the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis for their recording of his four string quartets. ",

      "description": "Harold Hall \"Doc\" Keen OBE (1894–1973) was a British engineer who produced the engineering design, and oversaw the construction of, the British bombe, a codebreaking machine used in World War II to read German messages sent using the Enigma machine. He was known as \"Doc\" Keen because of his habit of carrying tools and paperwork in a case resembling a doctor's bag. After the war he was awarded the O.B.E.. Keen was born in the borough of Shoreditch in east London in 1894. By age 18 he had moved to Kentish Town and began studying Electrical Engineering. In 1912 he joined the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), established to import and assemble American punched card technology. In 1916, Keen joined the Royal Flying Corps and was assigned to the ground staff of a bomber squadron in northern France. In 1919 he returned to BTM and married an Eva Burningham. In 1921, Keen moved with BTM to Letchworth in Hertfordshire. Two years later, he was appointed head of the Experimental Department, and his innovations there gained him the reputation as the leading British innovator of punched-card technology; Keen was granted more than sixty patents. In the 1930s he became Chief Engineer. ",

Its nighttime signal can often be heard throughout the Southern, Central, and Midwestern states and Northern Mexico, while its daytime signal provides at least secondary coverage from Oklahoma City to Austin. The station's studios are located in the Victory Park district in Dallas just north of downtown. WBAP is one of the oldest radio stations in Texas, dating back to 1922, when stations in Texas were still given call signs beginning with \"W\" instead of \"K.\" As of May 2019[update], WBAP remains a top-rated news/talk station.

The brainchild of Professor Clarence Flick, it went on the air on February 11, 1963, with only 85 watts of power. The studio is located in Hugh Gillis Hall, easily accessible to RTVF majors. Originally, its transmitting antenna was installed atop the Walquist Library Building on campus, but broadcasting range was adversely affected due to the nearby Bank of America Building's superior height. Today, however, its transmitter atop Coyote Peak broadcasts 1,500 watts, allowing the station to be heard by the entire Santa Clara Valley and much of the San Francisco Peninsula. Currently, the station features five musical formats: urban, electronic, alternative rock, rock en Español, and jazz. KSJS carried regular news programs produced by San Jose State's Radio-Television News Center, which had been started by Professor Gordon Greb in 1957. The programs in the 1960s included a world and national news program, broadcast shortly after the daily sign-on, and \"Spectrum,\" a college news program with emphasis on San Jose State news. ",

The station was owned by Cleveland Public Schools. In 1941, it was the first educational broadcaster in the nation to convert to FM as its high-frequency band was eliminated by the Federal Communications Commission. Under the direction of Dr. Wm. B.

      "description": "<p>WBOE went on the air on November 21, 1938, as an AM station operating at a high frequency requiring specially-constructed radios. The station was owned by Cleveland Public Schools. In 1941, it was the first educational broadcaster in the nation to convert to FM as its high-frequency band was eliminated by the Federal Communications Commission. Under the direction of Dr. Wm. B. Levenson, the station won national recognition for its use of radio broadcasts synchronized with lantern slides and playscripts, speakers on such topics as health and science, and student-produced programs on current events and student etiquette.

      "description": "John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from 1961 until his assassination near the end of his third year in office. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to becoming president. Kennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. In the 1960 presidential election, he narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. Kennedy's humor, charm, and youth in addition to his father's money and contacts were great assets in the campaign. Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history. Kennedy was the first Catholic elected president. ",

      "description": "Benjamin Arthur Quarles (January 23, 1904 – November 16, 1996) was an American historian, administrator, educator, and writer, whose scholarship centered on black American social and political history. Major books by Quarles include The Negro in the Civil War (1953), The Negro in the American Revolution (1961), Lincoln and the Negro (1962), and Black Abolitionists (1969). He demonstrated that blacks were active participants in major conflicts and issues of American history. His books were narrative accounts of critical wartime periods that focused on how blacks interacted with their white allies and emphasized blacks' acting as vital agents of change rather than receiving favors from whites. Quarles was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1904. His parents were Margaret (O'Brien), a homemaker, and Arthur Benedict Quarles, a subway porter. As a boy, Benjamin went to local public schools. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>The first county farm bureaus in the state of Iowa were organized in Clinton and Scott counties on September 1, 1912. The purpose of the farm bureaus was to coordinate the agricultural activities of the county and to work in cooperation with other local farm associations. The farm bureaus also employed a county agent to act as leader, and it was his responsibility to conduct agricultural demonstrations, offer advice to individual farmers, conduct agricultural meetings, and work with rural schools. The agent was supported financially by grants from the federal and state governments and funds raised within the organized counties. In addition, the county farm bureaus of Iowa cooperated directly with the United States Department of Agriculture and the Iowa State College (University) Agricultural Extension Department.</p><p>Within five years of the formation of the first farm bureaus in Iowa, farmers in thirty counties were organized. As the United States entered into World War I, an effort was made to organized the farmers in all of Iowa's counties. By June 1, 1918, all ninety-nine counties in Iowa were organized, forming a total of one hundred farm bureaus (Pottawattamie county was split into eastern and western halves).</p><p>The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation was formed December 27, 1918, at a meeting in Marshalltown attended by delegates from seventy-two of the state's one hundred coutny farm bureau organizations. During that meeting, the constitution and bylaws were formulated and executive officers and members of the board of directors were selected. James R. Howard of Marshall County was elected the first president of the IFBF. During its first year, the IFBF lobbied state and federal legislatures, assisted in establishing other agriculture-related organizations, created a federation publication, and joined with other state organizations to form the American Farm Bureau Federation. By the end of 1919, IFBF membership surpassed 100,000 members.</p><p>From its inception, the purpose of the IFBF was to help farm families prosper and improve their quality of life. Over the years IFBF has confronted a wide variety of issues ranging from global trade agricultural education and research, distribution and marketing of farm goods, farm credit, rural power and communications, soil conservation, and price support programs to name just a few. Membership in the IFBF is open to people of any occupation and, as of 2007, claims over 150,000 member families to be part of its organization.</p><citation>From the description of Records, 1914- (Iowa State University). WorldCat record id: 85774022</citation><p>Evolved from a Crop Improvement Association which was partially financed by Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck and Company and Chambers of Commerce. Iowa counties of Clinton, Scott, Black Hawk, Muscatine, Montgomery, Clay and Greene became active and organized in July 1912. During World War I, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture designated the County Crop Improvement Associations to promote stepped up food production and food conservation. By the end of the war, all County War Emergency organizations felt the need for a permanent farm association. When they became permanent, the name was changed to County Farm Bureau. Before the end of 1917 every county in Iowa had a Farm Bureau. The federating of the County Farm Bureaus took place in December of 1918.</p><p>The object of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation was \"to develop, strengthen and correlate the work of the County Farm Bureaus of the state; to encourage and promote cooperation of all representative agricultural organizations in every effort to improve and facilitate conditions for the economic and efficient production of, conservation of, marketing of, transportation of and distribution of farm products; to further the study and enactment of constructive agricultural legislation; to advise with representatives of the public agricultural institutions cooperating with Farm Bureaus in the determination of state-wide policies and to inform Farm Bureau members regarding all movements that affect their interests.\"</p><citation>From the description of Records, 1920-1976.

He had a history of supporting racial segregation but complied with a federal court order to finally desegregate Mississippi's public schools. He was first elected to Congress in 1946, from Mississippi's 7th congressional district. He was the youngest man to be elected U.S. Representative from Mississippi. In what was then a one-party state due to disenfranchisement of African Americans, he was re-elected repeatedly to Congress through the 1966 election, even as the congressional districts were redefined.

CSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby, Stills and Nash performed together informally in July of that year, discovering they harmonized well. Crosby had been asked to leave The Byrds in late 1967, and Stills' band Buffalo Springfield had broken up in early 1968; Nash left his band The Hollies in December, and by early 1969 the trio had signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records. Their first album, Crosby, Stills & Nash, was released in May 1969, from which came two Top 40 hits, \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" [#21] and \"Marrakesh Express\" [#28]. In order to tour the album, the trio hired drummer Dallas Taylor and session bassist Greg Reeves, though they still needed a keyboardist; Ahmet Ertegun suggested Neil Young, who had played with Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and after some initial reluctance, the trio agreed, signing him on as a full member. The band, now named Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, started their tour, and played their second gig at Woodstock Festival in the early morning hours of August 18, 1969. The first album with Young, Déjà Vu, reached number one in several international charts in 1970, and remains their best selling album, going on to sell over 8 million copies with three hit singles: \"Woodstock\", \"Teach Your Children\", and \"Our House\". The group's second tour, which produced the live double album 4 Way Street (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by John Barbata, and tensions with Stills, which resulted in his being temporarily dismissed from the band. At the end of the tour the band split up. The group have since reunited several times, sometimes with and sometimes without Young, and have released eight studio and four live albums. ",

      "inceptionDate": "November 20, 1952",
      "description": "National Educational Television (NET) was a United States educational broadcast television network that operated from May 16, 1954 to October 4, 1970. It was owned by the Ford Foundation and later co-owned by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It was succeeded by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which has memberships with many television stations that were formerly part of NET. \n\nThe network was founded as the Educational Television and Radio Center (ETRC) in November 1952 by a grant from the Ford Foundation's Fund for Adult Education (FAE). It was originally a limited service for exchanging and distributing educational television programs produced by local television stations to other stations; it did not produce any material by itself.\n\nIn the spring of 1954, ETRC moved its operations to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and on May 16 of that year, it began operating as a \"network\". It put together a weekly five-hour package of television programs, distributing them primarily on kinescope film to the affiliated stations by mail. By 1956, ETRC had 22 affiliated stations, expected to grow to 26 by March 1957. The programming was noted for treating subjects in depth, including hour-long interviews with people of literary and historical importance. The programming was also noted for being dry and academic, with little consideration given to entertainment value, a marked contrast to commercial television. Many of the shows were designed as adult education, and ETRC was nicknamed the \"University of the Air\" (or, less kindly, \"The Bicycle Network\", both for its low budget and for the way NET supposedly sent programs to its affiliates, by distributing its program films and videotapes via non-electronic means such as by mail, termed in the television industry as \"bicycling\").\n\nThe center's headquarters moved from Ann Arbor to New York City in 1958, and the organization became known as the National Educational Television and Radio Center (NETRC). The center became more aggressive at this time, aiming to ascend to the role of the U.S.' fourth television network. Among its efforts, the network began importing programs from the BBC into the United States, starting with An Age of Kings in 1961. It increased its programming output to ten hours a week. Most NETRC network programs were produced by the affiliate stations because the NETRC had no production staff or facilities of its own. NETRC also contracted programs from independent producers and acquired foreign material from countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Yugoslavia, the USSR, France, Italy and West Germany.\n\nStarting from 1962, the federal government took over the FAE's grants-in-aid program through the Education Television Facilities Act.\n\nIn November 1963 NETRC changed its name to National Educational Television, and spun off its radio assets. Under the centerpiece program NET Journal, which began airing in fall of 1966, NET began to air controversial, hard-hitting documentaries that explored numerous social issues of the day such as poverty and racism. While praised by critics, some affiliates, especially those in politically and culturally conservative markets, objected to the perceived liberal slant of the programming. The other NET-produced program begun in 1967, Public Broadcast Laboratory, produced similar complaints.\n\nIn 1966, NET's position as a combined network and production center came into question when President Lyndon Johnson arranged for the Carnegie Foundation to conduct a study on future of educational television. The Carnegie Commission released its report in 1967, recommending educational television be transformed to \"public television\". The new organization would be controlled by the nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting (a corporation established by the federal government) and receive funding from the government and other sources. Under this plan, funds were to be distributed to individual stations and to independent production centers – which is what NET would have been reduced to under this plan. The Ford Foundation, interested Educational Television Stations, and President Johnson supported the recommendations of the Carnegie Commission in the Public Broadcasting Act, which was signed into law on November 7, 1967.",

The institute played a key role in the Human Potential Movement beginning in the 1960s. Its innovative use of encounter groups, a focus on the mind-body connection, and their ongoing experimentation in personal awareness introduced many ideas that later became mainstream. Esalen was founded by Stanford graduates Michael Murphy and Dick Price in 1962. Their intention was to support alternative methods for exploring human consciousness, what Aldous Huxley described as \"human potentialities\". Over the next few years, Esalen became the center of practices and beliefs that make up the New Age movement, from Eastern religions/philosophy, to alternative medicine and mind-body interventions, to Gestalt Practice.

Bennett Papers, 1903-2001 (bulk: 1949-1992) (University of Florida). WorldCat record id: 19617386</citation><p>Charles \"Charlie\" Edward Bennett was born on December 2, 1910 in Canton, New York. At the age of two his family relocated to Tampa, Florida, where his father worked for the U.S. Weather Bureau. Charles lived in Tampa throughout his youth. He was an Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts of America and received the Eagle Scout Award. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Florida. He was president of the UF student body and served as editor of the Florida Alligator student newspaper. In addition to a wide range of volunteer activities and participation in political organizations, Charles worked his way through college by waiting tables, working on a university farm, and writing articles for local newspapers.</p><p>After graduating from UF with a Juris Doctor law degree in 1934, Bennett began practicing law in Jacksonville, Florida. In 1941, Bennett was elected to a term in the Florida State legislature. In early 1942 he gave up his legislative seat and joined the U.S. Army as a private. Bennett served in the Pacific during World War II, including fighting in the Philippines and New Guinea. While serving in the Philippines, he contracted polio, a disease that left his legs partially paralyzed for the remainder of his life. When Bennett left Army service in 1947 he had attained the rank of Captain. He was awarded both a Bonze and Sliver Star for his outstanding wartime accomplishments.</p><p>Following the war, Bennett returned to Jacksonville and resumed practicing law. In 1949 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as the Democratic representative of Jacksonville's 2nd district (which became the 3rd district in 1967). He was re-elected twenty-one more times, serving from 1949 to 1993, and he rarely faced strong opposition. In 1953, Bennett married Dorothy Jean, with whom he had four children: Lucinda (Cindy), Charles Jr., James, and Bruce. Throughout his life, Bennett was devoted to his Christian faith; he was a deacon and taught Sunday school for many years at the Riverside Avenue Christian Church in Jacksonville. In 1955 he sponsored the legislation which added the phrase \"In God We Trust\" to American currency. Later in his life Bennett revealed that he believed this was his most important accomplishment as a Congressman.</p><p>Throughout his political career Bennett fought against corruption in legislature, promoting a code of ethics for members of government that came to be called \"The Ten Commandments.\" His strict adherence to a high standard of personal ethics resulted in his nicknames such as \"Mr. Ethics\" and \"Mr. Clean.\" He led efforts to establish the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1958, and the \"Code of Ethics for Government Service.\" He also was the first chair of the Congressional Ethics Committee. Fiscally conservative and a great opponent of waste, Bennett's leftover campaign funds were donated to the National Parks Service, and he regularly returned his veteran disability pension to the U.S. Treasury. Bennett also refused his congressional pay raises and voted against the practice in Congress. He received the \"Watchdog of the Treasury Award\" on multiple occasions for his strong support of economy in government.</p><p>During the 1950s and 1960s, Bennett voted with many southern Democrats against civil rights and Great Society programs, including Medicare and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He also signed the so-called Southern Manifesto in 1956, generally opposing the integration of public schools. However, in 1965 Bennett broke with the southern bloc to support the 1965 Voting Rights Act, arguing that it was based on a \"constitutional obligation.\" Throughout his later political career he consistently received a great deal of support from Jacksonville's African-American community.</p><p>Bennett was very concerned with the nation's defense and security, and for many years was second in seniority on the House Armed Services Committee. Bennett strongly opposed worldwide proliferation of nuclear arms, and in the 1960s he supported the creation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In the 1980s, he supported funding for more conventional weapons and reductions in Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) spending. His legislation also set standards for upgrades in military housing, particularly in his own district's naval air stations.</p><p>Domestically, Bennett was concerned with urban issues of poverty, juvenile delinquency and drug use, and the raising of auto safety standards. He also advocated better working conditions for migrant farm workers, increased awareness for animal rights, establishment of the National Teachers Corps, federal aid to hospital and school construction, child welfare programs, and establishment of the Small Business Administration. As a disabled person Bennett promoted the rights of handicapped individuals. He co-sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, fought for architectural improvements to aid the handicapped, and regularly sought to demonstrate the often underestimated capacity of disabled persons. Despite his paralysis, he acquired the longest consecutive record of roll call votes in Congress without an absence - 26 years.</p><p>Bennett also was a historian of Florida and U.S. colonial history, writing and publishing nine books and several articles. He was a proponent of environmental conservation and historical preservation. He often sponsored bills to preserve or improve Florida's environment, including the prevention of erosion on Florida's beaches. He was instrumental in the creation of the Fort Caroline National Park Memorial in Jacksonville and its surrounding Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, as well as the Key Deer Preserve in the Florida Keys. He also was co-sponsor of the Wilderness Preservation Act and the Land and Water Conservation Act.</p><p>In 1993, Bennett retired from Congress to care for his ailing wife. He suffered a heart attack and a stroke in 2002. He died on September 6, 2003 in Jacksonville at age 92 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</p><citation>From the guide to the Charles E.

      "description": "The NBC Symphony Orchestra was a radio orchestra conceived by David Sarnoff, the president of the Radio Corporation of America, especially for the conductor Arturo Toscanini. The NBC Symphony performed weekly radio concert broadcasts with Toscanini and other conductors and served as house orchestra for the NBC network. The orchestra's first broadcast was on November 13, 1937 and it continued until disbanded in 1954. A new ensemble, independent of the network, called the Symphony of the Air, followed. It was made up of former members of the NBC Symphony Orchestra and performed from 1954 to 1963, particularly under Leopold Stokowski. Tom Lewis, in the Organization of American Historians Magazine of History, described NBC's plan for cultural programming and the origin of the NBC Symphony: ",

Reynaud opposed the Munich agreements of September 1938, when France and the United Kingdom gave way before Hitler's proposals for the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. After the outbreak of World War II Reynaud became the penultimate Prime Minister of the Third Republic in March 1940. He was also vice-president of the Democratic Republican Alliance center-right party. Reynaud was Prime Minister during the German defeat of France in May and June 1940; he persistently refused to support an armistice with Germany, as premier in June 1940, he unsuccessfully attempted to save France from German occupation in World War II, and resigned on 16 June. After unsuccessfully attempting to flee France, he was arrested by Philippe Petain's administration. Surrendering to German custody in 1942, he was imprisoned in Germany and later Austria until liberation in 1945, where he was released after the Battle of Itter Castle in which one of the leaders, German Major Josef Gangl, declared a hero by the Austrian resistance, gave his life, taking a sniper's bullet to save Reynaud.

      "description": "WETS-FM (89.5 FM) is the National Public Radio member station for the Tri-Cities region of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. The station is operated by East Tennessee State University as a partnership between ETSU and the station’s listeners. WETS receives a little over half of its funding from listener contributions. It also receives public funding from federal (Corporation for Public Broadcasting) and government-funded university sources. Its studios are located on the ETSU campus in Johnson City, Tennessee. Operating 24-hours a day, the station also has a SHOUTcast webcast available on its web site. The station also operates an FM translator at 91.5 MHz in Lenoir, North Carolina. In addition to news and discussion programming, the station carries entertainment and music programming on the weekends, including Americana music, featuring local music from southern Appalachia. The programming on the news and discussion front ranges from the BBC World Service to NPR programs such as Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Fresh Air, and The Diane Rehm Show to the Pacifica Radio-produced Democracy Now! program. The airing of the left-wing Democracy Now! has proven to be controversial, since the Tri-Cities is a decidedly politically and culturally conservative region. As such, the station lost a number of members who objected to WETS broadcasting the program. However, the show has also attracted a base of local supporters, who have formed a \"Democracy Now Tri-Cities\" group dedicated to keeping the program on the air. This group has urged WETS not to succumb to ideological pressure to censor liberal opinions that are otherwise seldom heard in the region. WETS is the home station of Your Weekly Constitutional, a constitutional law show produced in collaboration with Montpelier. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>In 1938, Indiana University began to engage in radio activities. A room was set aside for use as a studio and control room and a radio director and program director were hired. Courses such as \"Radio Broadcasting\" and \"Radio Writing\" were offered through the Department of Speech and \"Radio News\" in the Department of Journalism. In addition, two graduate courses were initiated: \"Radio in Education\" in the School in Education and \"Radio Seminar\" in the Department of Speech.</p><p>At the Board of Trustees September 20, 1945 meeting, they approved the establishment of a Department of Radio as an \"unattached department\" under the Dean of Faculties. Beginning the fall of 1950, IU offered a B.S. in Radio and listed the courses under the College of Arts and Sciences, but it wasn't until 1953 that Radio officially began a part COAS, when the Trustees approved the establishment of the Department of Radio and Television. In 1974, the Trustees approved a name change to the Department of Telecommunications in order to better reflect the expanded scope of their academic program. This change went into effect on July 1.</p><p>Harry Skornia served as Director of Radio Programs (and chair of the department once it was established) from 1942-1953. Following him was Elmer Sulzer, who chaired the department for the decade from 1954-1964. Sulzer was succeeded by Donley Feddersen, who served as department chair from 1966-1970.</p><p>Today the Department of Telecommunications is home to over forty faculty members. It offers courses in marketing strategies, multimedia design, radio and television production, processes and effects, and industry and management.</p><citation>From the guide to the Indiana University Department of Radio and Television Chair's records, 1939-1963, bulk 1945-1952, (Indiana University Office of University Archives and Records Management http://www.libraries.iub.edu/archives)</citation></biogHist>",

Established in 1754 as King's College on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan, Columbia is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. It is one of nine colonial colleges founded prior to the Declaration of Independence, seven of which belong to the Ivy League. Columbia was established by royal charter from George II of Great Britain in reaction to the founding of Princeton College. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University. ",

(Columbia University In the City of New York). WorldCat record id: 642164811</citation><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED As an institution and a community, Columbia University completely mobilized its people and resources in order to help the United States and its allies, as well as protect itself from possible enemy attack, during World War II. The war affected the University most directly once the U.S. was involved, but the topic had entered the campus consciousness as early as 1933, when the merits of entering into war were debated on campus by faculty and students alike. By the fall of 1941, with war raging in Europe, it was becoming more and more likely the U.S. would eventually be drawn into the conflict. In response, the University began preparing itself for the contingencies of war, well before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December of that year.</p><p>The University participated in the war effort in several major ways: government-aided research, civilian defense, war relief, and military and educational training programs. Scientific research was conducted both on campus and in laboratories on Long Island and in Connecticut. Columbia engaged in research in the fields of engineering, physics, and medicine, ranging from high profile programs like the Manhattan Project to lesser known projects such as one developing underwater sonar systems. Research conducted during WWII sometimes continued into the post-war period, and new research projects were given to the university as the connections between government agencies and the University begun during the war period continued and grew.</p><p>Two major programs instituted on campus, in addition to the ongoing research in the many labs in and around campus, were Civilian Defense and the Committee for War Relief. Civilian Defense, a domain mainly controlled by men on campus, was comprised of six different committees: Committee on Campus Protection (including the Building Control Division), Committee on Community Education, Committee on Courses of Training, Committee on Protection of Valuable Possessions, Committee on Technical Advice, and Committee on Volunteer Participation. Another important sub-division of the Civilian Defense program was the Student Auxiliary Corps (SAC) comprising five different squads – fire, first aid, campus patrol, information desk and communications. All of these committees used the talents and manpower of those in the campus community to institute defensive measures such as blackout regulations, air raid drills, evacuation procedures, and training in first-aid. The committee also acted as a liaison between Columbia and the larger New York City and metropolitan area communities and their civilian defense programs.</p><p>Committee for War Relief was mainly the domain of women within the Columbia community and acted primarily as a fundraising organization. It raised money through the organization of fairs, concerts and lectures in order to aid people suffering in war torn countries, such as Britain and France. In addition to fundraising, this group also organized volunteers to make surgical dressings, knit socks, organize blood drives and hold lectures on home front activities, such as growing victory gardens.</p><p>Columbia also made its facilities available to the military as a place where thousands of new recruits could be housed and instructed in the United States Naval Reserve (U.S.N.R.) Midshipmen's School, the Navy V-12 program and the U.S. Navy School of Military Government and Administration. Additionally, the university adjusted its coursework within the college and other areas of the school to meet the new needs of wartime. Thus, map-making classes, more engineering courses, speeded up degree programs, and intensive language courses in Japanese and German were instituted.</p><citation>From the guide to the World War II Collection, 1933-1956., (Columbia University.

Created in 1936 by Edsel Ford and his father Henry Ford, it was originally funded by a US$25,000 gift from Edsel Ford. By 1947, after the death of the two founders, the foundation owned 90% of the non-voting shares of the Ford Motor Company. (The Ford family retained the voting shares. ) Between 1955 and 1974, the foundation sold its Ford Motor Company holdings and now plays no role in the automobile company. Ahead of the foundation selling its Ford Motor Company holdings, in 1949, Henry Ford II created the Ford Motor Company Fund, a separate corporate foundation that to this day serves as the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company and is not associated with the foundation.

Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported École Polytechnique in France, Cooper Union was established in 1859. The school was built on a radical new model of American higher education based on founder Peter Cooper's fundamental belief that an education \"equal to the best technology schools established\" should be accessible to those who qualify, independent of their race, religion, sex, wealth or social status, and should be \"open and free to all.\" ",

      "description": "Abraham Alexander Ribicoff (April 9, 1910 – February 22, 1998) was an American Democratic Party politician from the state of Connecticut. He represented Connecticut in the United States House of Representatives and Senate and was the 80th Governor of Connecticut and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in President John F. Kennedy's cabinet. He was Connecticut's first and to date only Jewish governor. Born in New Britain, Connecticut, to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from Poland, Samuel Ribicoff, a factory worker, and Rose Sable Ribicoff, he attended local public schools. Ribicoff's relatively poor parents valued education and insisted that all his earnings from part-time boyhood jobs go toward his future schooling. After high school, he worked for a year at a nearby factory of the G. E. Prentice Company to earn additional funds for college. Ribicoff enrolled at New York University in 1928, then transferred to the University of Chicago after the Prentice Company made him the Chicago office manager. While in Chicago, Ribicoff coped with school and work schedules and was permitted to enter the university's law school before finishing his undergraduate degree. Still a student, he married Ruth Siegel on June 28, 1931; they would have two children. Ribicoff served as editor of the University of Chicago Law Review in his third year and received an LLB cum laude in 1933, being admitted to the Connecticut bar the same year. After practicing law in the office of a Hartford lawyer, Ribicoff set up his practice, first in Kensington and later in Hartford. ",

In 1983, he fronted the contemporary jazz group, Windows, which delivered four top 10 radio records punctuated by the album, \"The French Laundry,\" which reached number one on the radio charts. Wise's solo debut onto the music scene came with the 1989 Top 30 Single, \"Standing Outside in the Rain\" on the European pop charts. Partnering with producer Les Pierce in 1994, Colour Club was born, delivering three albums from JVC America, with the self-titled album reaching number seven on the radio charts. Several videos and singles in the US and Japan helped establish Colour Club as a pioneer in the acid jazz movement of the 1990s. Best known for his music recording career, Wise is also the co-founder of Blue Microphones, the highly respected audio manufacturer. In 1999, Skipper left the music industry to dedicate his time and passion full-time to Blue Microphones. ",

WRUL was allowed to resume partial independent programming in 1947, and full independent programming in 1954. Metromedia bought the station in 1960. In June 1962, International Educational Broadcasting Corporation, owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, bought WRUL. On June 1, 1966, WRUL changed its call letters to WNYW, which stood for Radio New York Worldwide. <citation> From the combined records of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), held by the University of Maryland and the Wisconsin Historical Society, and compiled as part of the Unlocking the Airwaves project (unlockingtheairwaves.org).</citation></p>",

      "description": "The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is the national broadcaster of the United Kingdom. Headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, it is the world's oldest national broadcaster, and the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, employing over 22,000 staff in total, of whom more than 19,000 are in public-sector broadcasting. The total number of BBC staff amounts to 35,402 including part-time, flexible, and fixed-contract staff. The BBC is established under a Royal Charter and operates under its Agreement with the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households, companies, and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts and iPlayer catch-up. The fee is set by the British Government, agreed by Parliament, and is used to fund the BBC's radio, TV, and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK. Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service (launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service), which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic and Persian.

WorldCat record id: 155863009</citation><p><span>The Third Programme of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was inaugurated on September 29, 1946, as part of the BBC's post-war restructuring of radio into three networks. Responding to the public's growing interest in the arts, which BBC programs during World War II had helped to foster, the BBC instituted three complementary networks designed not only to inform and entertain, but to educate the public as well: the Home Service, the Light Programme, and the Third Programme. The Home Service provided a broad range of news, educational, and entertainment services and was the principal channel. The Light Programme, as the name implies, offered lighter fare which was intended purely for relaxation and amusement purposes. The Third Programme was more serious in nature and catered to an esoteric audience. Its purpose, as outlined by Sir William Haley, was to present \"the great classical repertoire in music and drama, and, so far as they are broadcastable, in literature and the other arts,\" things \"culturally satisfying and significant.\" The BBC defined the program as \"being for the educated rather than an educational programme.\" The esoteric nature of the Third Programme proved to be detrimental rather than beneficial to the BBC. Although the BBC was generally praised for its noble ambition of raising cultural standards, the Third Programme's small following made the program less than cost-efficient. Saddled with rising production costs and stung by criticism of the Third Programme's elitist tendencies, the BBC decided in 1957 to curtail the program. Its decision was met with much protest, which came primarily from a small but highly organized following. Several hundred constituents organized The Third Programme Defense Society and enlisted support from a number of well-known intellectuals such as T. S. Eliot, Albert Camus, and Sir Laurence Olivier, who headed the Society's seven-man delegation. Despite the Society's efforts, the Third Programme was truncated--its air time was reduced from 40 to 24 hours a week--but was otherwise materially unaltered. It continued to offer a combination of spoken word and music, though with fewer repeats and fewer long speeches, until 1970. At that point, aware of listener divisions the three-network system had perpetrated, BBC virtually phased out the Third Programme, allotting it only eight hours per week and merging much of the program's material with that of Radio Four, which had been developed for a more general audience.</span></p><p>Paulu, Burton.

      "description": "WABE FM 90.1 is a radio station in Atlanta, Georgia, that is affiliated with National Public Radio (NPR) and Public Radio International (PRI). WABE's format features mostly news/talk programming. It carries the NPR flagship programs Morning Edition and All Things Considered, with locally produced City Lights hosted by Lois Reitzes and Closer Look hosted by Rose Scott. The station is licensed to the Atlanta Board of Education (hence the \"ABE\" in the broadcast callsign). In September 1994, a nonprofit corporation, the Atlanta Educational Telecommunications Collaborative, Inc., was founded to provide financial, promotional, and volunteer support for WABE (as well as WPBA-TV and Atlanta Public Schools cable channel 22). WABE's signal reaches practically all of the northwestern and north-central parts of the state. It is the dominant public radio station in metropolitan Atlanta, but starting on June 30, 2014, has been joined during the daytime by Georgia Public Broadcasting's Atlanta feed on 88.5 WRAS-FM. GPB provides public radio programming to most of the rest of the state. ",

For the 2011-2012 school year, the Flint Community Schools had both middle schools, four elementary schools and one high school placed in the bottom 5% of all schools in the State of Michigan based on student achievement and attendance. The school district accommodated a total student population of about 30,000 students. It included two early childhood education centers, 18 elementary schools, and three secondary schools. The current mission statement of \"developing a community of learners who are prepared to live, work, and contribute to an ever changing society\" was developed by Walter Milton, who became Superintendent in 2005. Milton subsequently wrote a book entitled Me in the Making which included a chapter on his stormy tenure in Flint. ",

He is best known for being the first Western composer to make an ethnomusicological study of Bali, and for the quality of that work. He also composed music influenced by that of Bali and Java decades before such compositions that were based on world music became widespread. McPhee was born in Montreal. He enrolled in the Peabody Institute in 1918, studying composition with Gustav Strube and piano with Harold Randolph; subsequently he studied with the avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse before marrying Jane Belo, a disciple of Margaret Mead, in 1931.

In California, where he died in 1964, he contributed greatly to the study of world music. McPhee was a faculty member of the Music Department at UCLA from 1960-1964. Besides his musical talents, he was an excellent photographer (as seen in the Archive's collection). His publications include A Club of Small Men (1948), A House in Bali (1947), and Music of Bali (1956).

      "description": "Mount Holyoke College is a private liberal arts women's college in South Hadley, Massachusetts. It is the oldest member of the historic Seven Sisters colleges, a group of elite women's colleges in the Northeastern United States. The college was founded in 1837 as the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary by Mary Lyon, a pioneer in education for women. A model upon which many other women's colleges were patterned, it is the oldest institution within the Seven Sisters schools, an alliance of East Coast liberal arts colleges that was originally created to provide women with education equivalent to that provided in the then men-only Ivy League. Mount Holyoke is part of the region's Five College Consortium, along with Amherst College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst: through this membership, students are allowed to take courses at any other member institution. \n\nMount Holyoke Female Seminary opened on November 8, 1837 with 116 students. The first graduating class of three students received diplomas on August 23, 1838. Initially, homemaking, teaching and missionary work were the only occupations open to alumnae. By the middle of the nineteenth century, however, increasing numbers of alumnae had entered professions such as social work, librarianship, journalism, medicine, and law. Notable alumnae include poet Emily Dickinson; women's rights advocate Lucy Stone; Olympia Brown, the first woman to become a full-time ordained minister; physician and anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar; playwrights Wendy Wasserstein and Suzan-Lori Parks; Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve as a member of the cabinet of a United States President; and Ella Grasso, the first women elected a state governor in her own right (not as the successor of her husband). A number of these women have been honored on United States postage stamps or with induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame.  -- From the guide to the Students and Alumnae Profiles and Statistics Collection RG 23., 1882-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>The first official publication of Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was a catalogue issued in 1837 containing information about trustees, teachers, terms of admission, the course of study, the schedule for the year, Family Accommodations, and the Moral and Religious Influence at the school. Subsequent catalogues (with periodic updates) trace the growth of the institution and provide detailed information about the academic program and residential life for students at the College. These publications have been supplemented by courses of instruction booklets,, catalogues for summer sessions held during World War II, course evaluations, and handbooks providing guidance for new students as well as teachers and administrators serving as academic advisers. Class schedules were first issued in 1893 showing meeting times and locations and instructors of individual courses. Beginning in 1845, Mount Holyoke administrators compiled registers and directories listing names and addresses of teachers and students. Weekly calendars first issued in November 1905 initially listed events at the College. In 1983, these lists began including more detailed information about lectures, special programs, renovations to buildings, and other subjects of interest to members of the Mount Holyoke community.</p><citation>From the guide to the Catalogs, Registers, and Directories RG 10., 1837-2010, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>Mary Lyon, the founder of Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, was Principal of the school from 1837 until her death in 1849. Her successors as Principal were Mary C. Whitman (1849-1850), Mary W. Chapin (1850-1865), Sophia D. Stoddard (Acting Principal, 1865-1867), and Helen M. French (1867-1872). In 1888, Elizabeth Blanchard, who had served as Principal since 1883, was named Acting President when Mount Holyoke's charter was changed to allow the school to grant degrees. Mary A. Brigham was elected President in 1889, but died in a railway accident on the way to assume her duties. Louise F. Cowles was Acting President until Elizabeth Storrs Mead became the first non-alumna President of the College in 1890. Her successor, Mary Emma Woolley, was elected President in 1900, took office in 1901, and served until 1937. In a controversial appointment, Roswell Gray Ham then became Mount Holyoke's first male President. His successor, Richard Glenn Gettell, was President until his resignation in 1968. Academic Dean and history professor Meribeth E.

Her successors as Principal were Mary C. Whitman (1849-1850), Mary W. Chapin (1850-1865), Sophia D. Stoddard (Acting Principal, 1865-1867), and Helen M. French (1867-1872). In 1888, Elizabeth Blanchard, who had served as Principal since 1883, was named Acting President when Mount Holyoke's charter was changed to allow the school to grant degrees. Mary A. Brigham was elected President in 1889, but died in a railway accident on the way to assume her duties. Louise F. Cowles was Acting President until Elizabeth Storrs Mead became the first non-alumna President of the College in 1890. Her successor, Mary Emma Woolley, was elected President in 1900, took office in 1901, and served until 1937. In a controversial appointment, Roswell Gray Ham then became Mount Holyoke's first male President. His successor, Richard Glenn Gettell, was President until his resignation in 1968. Academic Dean and history professor Meribeth E. Cameron, who had served as Acting President when Presidents Ham and Gettell were on leave in 1954 and 1966, filled that office once again until David B. Truman became President in 1978.

Board members also play a role in the selection of Presidents of the College as well as those who receive honorary degrees from Mount Holyoke. The Board was established in 1836 and consisted of several \"benevolent gentlemen\" who helped Mary Lyon plan a school for the higher education of women and would its own property and not be a for-profit venture. The original trustees were Joseph Avery, William Bowdoin, David Choate, Joseph Condit, Roswell Hawks, Edward Hitchcock, Heman Humphrey, Andrew W. Potter, Daniel Safford, John Todd, William Tyler, and Samuel Williston. The first woman trustee, Sarah Williston, was appointed to the Board in 1884. Mount Holyoke Principals and Presidents have also been members of the Board since that year. In 1892, in an effort to strengthen the cooperation between the Board and alumnae in planning for the growth and welfare of Mount Holyoke, the trustees invited alumnae of the College to nominate one individual annually to serve on the Board for a three-year term. The trustees changed this practice in 1899 by asking the Alumnae Association to submit names of three alumnae candidates to fill each vacancy on the Board. The practice of adding a Young Alumnae Trustee to the Board began in 1970. The trustees have diverse backgrounds and are primarily drawn from academia, human services, politics and government, and the corporate world. Notable individuals who have served on the Board include Virginia Apgar (Class of 1929), Germaine Bree, Barbara Cassani (Class of 1982), Mary Phylinda Dole (Class of 1886), A. Bartlett Giamatti, August Heckscher, Alice Stone Ilchman (Class of 1957), Henry Plimpton Kendall, Janet Brewster Murrow (Class of 1933), Frances Perkins (Class of 1902), Gloria Johnson Powell (Class of 1958), Joseph and William Skinner, and Henry A. Stimson.</p><citation>From the guide to the Trustees Biographical Files RG 3. 2., ca. 1836-, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was established by educator Mary Lyon, who in 1832 began making plans for a school for the higher education of women that would own its own property and not be a for-profit venture. She enlisted the support of several clergymen and businessmen in and around Ipswich, Massachusetts, where she had been working as a teacher at Ipswich Female Seminary since 1828. Seven of these individuals - David Choate, Daniel Dana, Joseph Felt, George W. Heard, Edward Hitchcock, Asa Howland, and Theophilus Packard - formed a committee in September, 1834 that selected South Hadley, Massachusetts as the location for the school and worked to obtain a charter for the institution from the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that was granted on February 11, 1836. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary opened on November 7, 1837. The academic program expanded from three to four years in 1861/62 and students who completed the prescribed course of study received diplomas. In the late 1880s, in response to competition from degree-granting women's colleges, Mount Holyoke successfully petitioned the state legislature for a charter change that was granted on March 8, 1888. At that time, the name of the school changed to Mount Holyoke Seminary and College and the first degrees were awarded on June 27, 1889. The Seminary Program that did not lead to a degree was phased out and another change to the charter granted on January 31, 1893 marked the institution's transformation into Mount Holyoke College.</p><citation>From the guide to the Origins and Governance Collection RG 2., 1834-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>The Mount Holyoke College War Collection brings together a wide range of materials that show how students, faculty, administrators, and alumnae of the College responded to various wars from the United States Civil War (1861-1865) to the Iraq War (2003-present). Most of the collection consists of records created by College departments, offices, and committees, including the Office of the President, the Appointment Bureau, the News Bureau, the Public Relations Office, and the Alumnae Association. The collection also includes newspaper articles, records of local, national, and international war-related committees, and materials received from alumnae and other donors.</p><citation>From the guide to the Mount Holyoke College War Collection RG 30., 1860-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>The first administrator and teacher at Mount Holyoke was Mary Lyon, the founder of the school who was Principal from 1837 until her death in 1849 as well as a teacher in chemistry classes. Initially, she hired Eunice Caldwell as Associate Principal with Amanda A. Hodgman and Mary W. Smith as additional teachers. Lyon also relied on founding members of Mount Holyoke's Board of Trustees to assist her with managing the institution's finances and supervising the construction, furnishing, and maintenance of the Seminary Building where students and teachers lived and worked. She soon began hiring Mount Holyoke graduates as teachers at the school, a practice that continued for much of the nineteenth century. Teachers usually taught a variety of subjects and often supervised the domestic work system Lyon established whereby students did most of the cooking, cleaning, and laundry at the school (thus keeping the tuition rate low by eliminating the need for a paid staff). Men were hired to perform heavy manual labor and a Steward was responsible for the overall maintenance and upkeep of buildings and grounds. Trustees continued to act as Treasurers of Mount Holyoke until the early twentieth century. Other early staff members included a librarian (Mary O. Nutting, Class of 1852) and the Director of the Observatory (Elisabeth Bardwell, Class of 1866).</p><p>Teachers began specializing in particular subjects in the late 1880s. Elizabeth Mead, President of Mount Holyoke from 1890-1900, required teachers to earn a Ph.D. in their respective fields and by 1896 faculty were organized into a formal group which held regular meetings and actively shaped the College's curriculum. The first male teachers, Asa Kinney (botany) and William Churchill Hammond (music), were hired in 1899. When Mount Holyoke began a graduate program in the 1890s, graduate students (including those from countries other than the United States) began working as teaching or laboratory assistants at the College. The first paid sabbaticals were granted to faculty in 1925. Mount Holyoke's faculty has steadily become increasingly diverse in response to changes in the curriculum and the College's affirmative action initiatives.</p><p>The College has created many staff positions to meet the growth and changing needs of the school. For example, the first Registrar, Caroline Boardman Greene (Class of 1889) was appointed in 1893 and Florence Purington (Class of 1886) became the first Dean of the College in 1907. When students began living in separate dormitories after the destruction of the Seminary Building by fire in 1896, house mothers were hired to oversee students' activities in each residence. Maids and other staff were hired in increasing numbers after the domestic work system ended in 1914. Other staff members have been appointed as needed, such as those who support the technological needs of faculty and staff as employees of Library, Information, and Technology Services.</p><citation>From the guide to the Faculty and Staff Biographical Files RG 19., circa 1837-, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary opened on November 8, 1837 with 116 students. The first graduating class of three students received diplomas on August 23, 1838. Initially, homemaking, teaching and missionary work were the only occupations open to alumnae. By the middle of the nineteenth century, however, increasing numbers of alumnae had entered professions such as social work, librarianship, journalism, medicine, and law. Notable alumnae include poet Emily Dickinson; women's rights advocate Lucy Stone; Olympia Brown, the first woman to become a full-time ordained minister; physician and anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar; playwrights Wendy Wasserstein and Suzan-Lori Parks; Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve as a member of the cabinet of a United States President; and Ella Grasso, the first women elected a state governor in her own right (not as the successor of her husband). A number of these women have been honored on United States postage stamps or with induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame. The Alumnae Association of Mount Holyoke College has also recognized the achievements and contributions of alumnae with a variety of awards including the Alumnae Medal of Honor and the Mary Lyon Award.</p><p>Although Mount Holyoke was established as a non-denominational school, most students during the nineteenth century were affiliated with Protestant denominations and the student body was not geographically, racially or ethnically diverse until the mid-twentieth century. The first Native American students, Elinor S. and Mary H. Boudinot (also spelled Boudinott), attended Mount Holyoke in the 1840s and were the daughters of an assimilated Cherokee father. The first known African American student at Mount Holyoke was Hortense Parker, Class of 1883. The first students born outside the United States came to Mount Holyoke from Canada or the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii) in the 1840s. The first student from Japan, Toshi Miyagawa enrolled in 1889 and the first students from China, Chi Nyok Wang and Ysu Tsit Law, graduated in 1916. Latina and Asian American women began attending Mount Holyoke in the 1930s. In 2010, Mount Holyoke enrolled students from 48 states and nearly 70 countries. On average, approximately one in every three undergraduates is an international citizen or an African American, Asian American, Latina, Native American, or multiracial student.</p><citation>From the guide to the Students and Alumnae Profiles and Statistics Collection RG 23., 1882-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary on November 8, 1837 with one hundred and sixteen students. The first graduating class of three students received diplomas on August 23, 1838. During much of the nineteenth century, each entering student took placement examinations to determine her placement in a particular class. Students were initially organized into three classes (Junior, Middle, and Senior) and until the late 1880s all students followed a set curriculum which focused on the mastery of specific textbooks and laboratory work in the sciences. In the fall of 1861, the curriculum expanded to a four-year program with students organized in Junior, Junior Middle, Senior Middle, and Senior classes. These class designations underwent some changes throughout the years until the s terms Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior were adopted in 1890. In the fall of 1989, Freshmen became known as First Year students.</p><p>In response to competition from degree-granting women's colleges established in the 1860s-1870s, Mount Holyoke's administrators petitioned the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a change in the school's charter. A new charter granted on March 8, 1888 changed the name of the institution to Mount Holyoke Seminary and College and allowed the school to award Bachelor's degrees, the first of which were presented at Commencement in 1889. With an additional charter change on January 31, 1893 the name of the school became Mount Holyoke College. From 1889-1902, Mount Holyoke presented Bachelor of Literature and Bachelor of Science degrees as well as Bachelor of Arts degrees. From 1889/1890-1898/1899, students followed a Classical, Literary, or Scientific course of study. There was also a Seminary program from 1888/89-1892/1893 which enabled students who had enrolled before 1888 to receive a diploma for their work. In 1889/1900, students began pursuing major work in specific disciplines and elective courses were introduced into the curriculum.</p><p>Mount Holyoke has also offered a wide variety of other programs for students. The option for pursuing graduate study became available in 1880/1881 when an Advanced Course for Mount Holyoke graduates was first offered and by 1923/1924 a program of graduate study for all qualified women was well-established. A course of study leading to a Master of Arts began in 1893/1894 and expanded in 1935/1936 to include a Master of Arts in Teaching program which was offered through 1975/1976. Helen C. Flint, Class of 1891 received the first M.A. degree awarded by the College in 1895. In 1966/1967, the graduate program was open to men as well as women and in 1968 Thomas Kelley became the first man to receive a degree (Master of Arts in Teaching) from the College. The Frances Perkins Program for women of non-traditional age who wish to complete the requirements for a Bachelor of Arts degree was established in 1980. Other special programs have included those for teachers wishing to improve their mastery of specific disciplines or for students from other countries who are interested in spending time at a college in the United States. Students enrolled in graduate or special programs have often received scholarships or fellowship from the College and worked as teaching assistants, interns, or residence hall staff while pursuing their studies.</p><citation>From the guide to the Alumnae Biographical Files RG 27. 1, RG 27. 2, RG 27. 3., circa 1831-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>In an 1835 pamphlet outlining her plans for Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, Mary Lyon stated that one of the goals of the school would be to cultivate the missionary spirit among its pupils. Soon after the Seminary opened on November 8, 1837 alumnae began serving as missionaries in the United States and in other countries, where they opened and staffed influential schools, brought aid to orphans and others, and supported social reforms to improve the lives of girls and women. Alumnae were affiliated with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), a Congregational Church organization founded in 1810, or with the missionary boards of other Protestant denominations. The first alumna missionary was Charlotte Bailey (1838), who worked with her husband, Aldin Grout, among the Zulus in South Africa. Other notable foreign missionaries during the nineteenth century were Fidelia Fiske (1842, Persia); Lyon's nieces Abigail Moore Burgess (1838, India) and Lucy Lyon Lord (1840, China); Charlotte and Mary Ely (1861, Armenia); Alice Gordon Gulick (1867, Spain); and Mary Otis Preston Spafford (1879, South Africa). Alumnae were also missionaries to the Cherokee and other Native Americans and to former African American slaves. Members of the Mount Holyoke community actively supported this work by raising funds for alumnae missionaries and establishing a number of organizations for students interested in missionary service, including the Student Volunteer Band and the College's chapter of the Young Women's Christian Association. Many missionaries and officials from mission boards also presented lectures and programs at Mount Holyoke.</p><p>The missionary service of alumnae continued in the twentieth century, exemplified by the work of Alice Browne Frame (1900) in China, Charlotte Allen Ward (1903) in Lebanon and Turkey, Ruth Parker White (1917) in India, Katharine Merrill (1917) in Japan, and Leila Childs Edling (1917) in Angola. Elsie Kimball (1909) and numerous other alumnae supported Near East Relief efforts in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia during and after World War I, while Grace Bacon (1918), Florence Brugger (1922), and many other Mount Holyoke women worked for the American Red Cross and other organizations during both world wars. Beginning in the 1960s, Gena Lee Reisner (1964) and other alumnae demonstrated the College's missionary spirit by joining the Peace Corps, Teach for America, and other initiatives designed to bring education and health care to those in need. Mount Holyoke students such as Sandra Nichols Ward (1965) engaged in this work as undergraduates by participating in Operation Crossroads Africa and similar programs.</p><citation>From the guide to the Mount Holyoke College Missionaries Collection RG 29., circa 1841-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation></biogHist>",

      "description": "The Four Freshmen are an American male vocal quartet that blends open-harmonic jazz arrangements with the big band vocal group sounds of The Modernaires, The Pied Pipers, and The Mel-Tones, founded in the barbershop tradition. The Four Freshmen is considered a vocal band because the singers accompany themselves on guitar, horns, bass, and drums, among other instrumental configurations. The group was founded in 1948 in Indiana and reached its peak popularity in the mid-1950s. The last original member retired in 1993, but the group stills tours internationally and has recorded jazz harmonies since its late 1940s founding in the halls of the Jordan School of Music at Butler University in Indianapolis.

      "description": "WBUR-FM (90.9 FM) is a public radio station located in Boston, Massachusetts, owned by Boston University. WBUR is the largest of three NPR member stations in Boston, along with WGBH and WUMB-FM. WBUR produces several nationally distributed programs, including On Point, Here and Now and Open Source, and previously produced Car Talk, Only a Game, and The Connection (which was cancelled on August 5, 2005). RadioBoston, launched in 2007, is WBUR's only purely local show. WBUR's positioning statement is \"Boston's NPR News Station\". WBUR also carries its programming on two other stations serving Cape Cod and the Islands: WBUH (89.1 FM) in Brewster, and WBUA (92.7 FM) in Tisbury. The latter station, located on Martha's Vineyard, uses the frequency formerly occupied by WMVY. In 1998, WBUR helped launch WRNI in Providence, Rhode Island—the first NPR station within Rhode Island's borders. It has since sold the station to a local group. ",

      "description": "Edgar Ansel Mowrer (March 8, 1892 – March 2, 1977) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and author best known for his writings on international events. Born in Bloomington, Illinois to Rufus and Nellie née Scott, Mowrer graduated from the University of Michigan in 1913. From his elder brother, Paul Scott Mowrer, the editor of Chicago Daily News, Mowrer received a job and in 1914 went to France as a foreign correspondent. From there he reported on events throughout the First World War, including the Italians' defeat at the Battle of Caporetto. In 1916, he married Lilian Thomson; the two had a daughter, Diana, and would remain together until Mowrer's death 61 years later. In May 1915 he was assigned to the Rome office of the Chicago Daily News, and there he interviewed Beni to Mussolini, then a Socialist, who was urging Italy to enter the war on the side of the Allies. After his marriage in London in February 1916, Mowrer returned with his wife to Italy, where he covered the battlefronts and witnessed the Italian defeat at Caporetto in 1917. ",

      "description": "Clarence Jordan (July 29, 1912 – October 29, 1969), a farmer and New Testament Greek scholar, was the founder of Koinonia Farm, a small but influential religious community in southwest Georgia and the author of the Cotton Patch paraphrase of the New Testament. He was also instrumental in the founding of Habitat for Humanity. His nephew, Hamilton Jordan, served as White House Chief of Staff during the Jimmy Carter administration. Jordan was born in Talbotton, Georgia, as the seventh of ten children to James Weaver and Maude Josey Jordan, prominent citizens of that small town. From an early age the young Jordan was troubled by the racial and economic injustice that he perceived in his community. Hoping to improve the lot of sharecroppers through scientific farming techniques, Jordan enrolled in the University of Georgia, earning a degree in agriculture in 1933. During his college years, however, Jordan became convinced that the roots of poverty were spiritual as well as economic. This conviction led him to the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, from which he earned a Th.M. and a Ph.D. in the Greek New Testament in 1938. He was ordained as a Southern Baptist minister. While at seminary Jordan met Florence Kroeger, and the couple were soon married. ",

White helped form Educational Television for the Metropolitan Area Inc. in 1961 and served as its secretary and as a board member to further this goal. In 1962, WNDT New York went on the air, becoming one of the country's outstanding ETV operations by 1968. In 1963, the National Educational Television and Radio Center put aside all its functions except for non-instructional television programming. It changed its name to National Educational Television and focused on cultural and public affairs programming. John White served as president of the National Educational Television and Radio Center from 1963 to 1969 .</p><p>After eleven years in public broadcasting, White returned to education in 1969 to serve as President of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. During this period, he began collaborating on a history of public broadcasting that was never completed. He retired from active work in 1990 but he continued to work as a consultant for the Aspen Institute from 1980 to 1988.</p><p>White was very active in his community through directorships in several companies including Orange and Rockland Utilities Inc. and Viacom International Inc. and participation in local clubs such as the Century, Tuxedo, and University Clubs. He was also an active church member. He served as Trustee of St. John the Divine in New York City from 1978 to 1988 and as a Vestryman of St. Mary's Church in Tuxedo Park from 1979 to 1986.</p><citation>From the guide to the John F.

Rose charged the group had libeled him in an article that implied he was a Communist sympathizer because of his collaboration with Gunnar Myrdal. Rose won the suit, but the $20,000 in damages was thrown out by the Minnesota Supreme Court on the grounds that Rose was a public figure.

      "description": "ARD (German pronunciation: [ˌaːʔɛʁˈdeː] (listen); full name: Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland – \"Working group of public broadcasters of the Federal Republic of Germany\") is a joint organisation of Germany's regional public-service broadcasters. It was founded in 1950 in West Germany to represent the common interests of the new, decentralised, post-war broadcasting services – in particular the introduction of a joint television network. The ARD has a budget of €6.9 billion and 22,612 employees. The budget comes primarily from a licence fee which every household, company and public institution are required by law to pay. For an ordinary household the fee is currently €17.50 per month. Households living on welfare are exempt from the fee. The fees are not collected directly by the ARD, but by the Beitragsservice (formerly known as Gebühreneinzugszentrale GEZ), a common organisation of the ARD member broadcasters, the second public TV broadcaster ZDF, and Deutschlandradio.

In addition to its symphony concerts, the orchestra gives pops concerts as the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. The Cincinnati Symphony is the resident orchestra for the Cincinnati May Festival, the Cincinnati Opera, and the Cincinnati Ballet. Additionally, the orchestra supports the Cincinnati Symphony Youth Orchestra (CSYO), a program for young musicians in grades 9 to 12. Several orchestras had existed in Cincinnati between 1825 and 1872. The immediate precursor ensemble to the current orchestra was the Cincinnati Orchestra, founded in 1872. In 1893, Helen Herron Taft founded the Cincinnati Orchestra Association, and the name of the orchestra was formalised to the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave its first concerts in 1895 at Pike's Opera House. A year later, the orchestra moved to Music Hall. Its first conductor was Frank Van der Stucken, a Texas-born musician of Flemish ancestry, who served until 1907. In the early years, the orchestra welcomed such composers as Richard Strauss and Edward McDowell. The orchestra also performed the U.S. premiere of the Symphony No. 5 of Gustav Mahler. ",

The current touring band has been together since 1987, with Jack Herrick (trumpet, bass), Bland Simpson (piano), Clay Buckner (fiddle), and Chris Frank (guitar). The original members included Mike Craver (guitar) Tommy Thompson (banjo), Bill Hicks (fiddle), and Jim Watson (mandolin, bass). Mike Craver joined Red Clay Ramblers in 1973, and recorded with them on their first record, which was released by Folkways under the title The Red Clay Ramblers with Fiddlin' Al McCanless. The quartet continued their recording career with Stolen Love on the Flying Fish label, recorded in 1974 and released in 1975 during their successful run in \"Diamond Studs.\" Jack Herrick joined the band in 1976 as a bass and trumpet player. The band recorded, concertized and performed in theatrical productions, most notably Diamond Studs (Bland Simpson/Jim Wann) off-Broadway in 1975. Their 1977 recording, Merchants Lunch, described a trucker's disastrous visit to a Nashville diner. (The diner still exists at the same location, but has been renamed the \"Merchant's Restaurant\").

The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space science. Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches. ",

      "description": "Trapezoid is an American folk music group led by Paul Reisler. Founded in 1975 by Sam Rizzetta and Reisler, they began as a quartet of hammer dulcimer players. Two of the four played the traditional hammer dulcimer, while the other two played baritone and treble hammer dulcimers specially designed by Rizzetta. The name of the band reflects the shape of the hammer dulcimer. Since 1975, the group's membership and instrumentation has changed repeatedly, always with Paul Reisler as a member. Their sound has been described as a \"plinking and plunking, buzzing, sweeping, ringing, droning, and wailing acoustic construction\" and as \"a delightful musical melange\" by the New York Times. In 2004 and 2005, the 1984 lineup that recorded Winter Solstice with John McCutcheon - minus fiddler Freyda Epstein, who was killed in 2003 in a car accident - reunited with McCutcheon to perform acoustic concerts, called the Winter Solstice tour.

      "description": "WBJC (91.5 FM) is a non-commercial, public FM radio station licensed to serve Baltimore, Maryland. The station is owned by Baltimore City Community College and broadcasts a classical music format. Its broadcast tower is located near Pikesville, Maryland at (39°23′11.0″N 76°43′51.0″W﻿ / ﻿39.386389°N 76.730833°W﻿ / 39.386389; -76.730833). WBJC-FM originally broadcast on 88.1 MHz with a 250 watt transmitter obtained from military surplus by Edward Arnold, chief engineer, to serve as a workshop for his students of radio and for those of the Department of Speech, Drama and Radio, headed by Clarence DeHaven at the Baltimore Junior College, which shared the campus of the Baltimore high school, known as Baltimore City College. Its antenna had a gain of -3db so that the effective radiated power was only 125 watts. However the antenna was on the top of the school's tower, which enjoyed a great view of almost all of Baltimore except for a few valleys. and its signal covered the City of Baltimore and much of surrounding counties. Generally speaking the station operated a flexible schedule as it was largely dependent on student volunteers. Generally the station signed off at 5 PM, but sports events often extended the broadcast day and led to weekend operation. ",

WorldCat record id: 70983375</citation><p>The national Phi Beta Kappa Society, America's oldest and most prestigious honor society, was founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. Membership in the national society is a significant achievement, which honors excellence in the arts and sciences. Election to Phi Beta Kappa is based on outstanding academic performance reflecting a love of learning for its own sake as opposed to narrow technical specialization or vocational preparation. To demonstrate the breadth of their intellectual curiosity, most students will have taken more than the required number of courses and studied in traditional academic fields outside their major.</p><p>As of 2003, there are over 250 Phi Beta Kappa chapters at colleges and universities across the country and 50 alumni associations in the United States and an estimated 500,000 living members. The Beta Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at Rice was established in 1929.</p><citation>From the guide to the Phi Beta Kappa, Beta Chapter (Rice University) records Rice UA 108., 1921-2006, (Rice University Archives, Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library, Rice University, Houston, TX)</citation><p><span>Organizational History</span></p><chronList><chronItem>1776Founded, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va.</chronItem><chronItem>1831Eliminated secrecy in rituals and membership</chronItem><chronItem>1877Established first graduate association, Phi Beta Kappa Alumni in New York</chronItem><chronItem>1883Established United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa</chronItem><chronItem>1926Established general headquarters and permanent staff, New York, N.Y.</chronItem><chronItem>1940Established Phi Beta Kappa Associates</chronItem><chronItem>1950Established Christian Gauss Award</chronItem><chronItem>1955Moved headquarters to Washington, D.C.</chronItem><chronItem>1958Established Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science</chronItem><chronItem>1960Established Ralph Waldo Emerson Award</chronItem></chronList><citation>From the guide to the Phi Beta Kappa Records, 1776-1999, (bulk 1900-1990), (Manuscript Division Library of Congress)</citation><p>Phi Beta Kappa is a national scholastic honorary fraternity that elects their members on the basis of scholastic achievement and good moral character.

La Follette Sr., in Madison, Wisconsin. Mayer, reared in Reform Judaism, was born in Chicago, the son of Morris Samuel Mayer and Louise (Gerson). He graduated from Englewood High School, where he received a classical education with an emphasis on Latin and languages. He studied at the University of Chicago (1925–28) but did not earn a degree; in 1942, he told the Saturday Evening Post that he was \"placed on permanent probation in 1928 for throwing beer bottles out a dormitory window.\" He was a reporter for the Associated Press (1928–29), the Chicago Evening Post, and the Chicago American.

WorldCat record id: 122378686</citation><p>Deems Taylor was born on December 22, 1885 in New York City, and attended Ethical Culture for secondary school there. While a student at New York University he wrote four comic operas with William LeBaron, one of which received the attention of theatrical producer Charles Dillingham and was produced by him. Taking the advice of Victor Herbert, Taylor studied music theory with Oscar Coon. Meanwhile Taylor also began to publish music criticism, first for the New York Press, and later for the New York Tribune (1916-1917), Collier's Weekly (1917-1919).</p><p>Sometime during the mid 1910s Taylor formed a close friendship with Percy Rector Stephens, a vocal instructor and conductor of the Schumann Club. The purpose of the Schumann Club was to deliver programs for women's vocal ensemble that would follow as closely as possible the structure of the artist recital programs. Taylor approached the task with enthusiasm. In addition, Taylor published arrangements and translations of songs and choral music up through 1920.</p><p>Deems Taylor was music critic for the New York World from 1921 through 1925. He continued musical criticism by becoming editor of Musical America (1927-1929) and critic for the New York American 1931-1932). He was pressed into service for radio broadcasts and had a well-received series on music appreciation. He was also commentator for broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. As a result of his reputation as educator, he was selected by Walt Disney as commentator for the film Fantasia (1940). He published articles and several books, The Well Tempered Listener (1940), Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940), Music to My Ears (1949), Some Enchanted Evenings: The Story of Rodgers and Hammerstein (1953).</p><p>After the 1920s Taylor composed large scale works. His orchestral suite Through the Looking Glass was well received. His reputation grew after the premiere of his first mature opera, The King's Henchman (1927), which had its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. Excerpts from The King's Henchman were selected for the inaugural broadcast of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in September 1927. This was surpassed by his next opera, Peter Ibbetson which also premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 1931 which stayed in the repertory for four seasons. Succeeding works were less well received. They include the operas Ramuntcho (1942) and The Dragon (1958), as well as orchestral works and cantatas.</p><p>Deems Taylor died in New York City on July 3, 1966.</p><citation>From the guide to the [Arrangements of choral music by various composers] / Deems Taylor, 1917-1920?, (The New York Public Library.

The university offers more than 200 undergraduate-degree programs along with a variety of graduate and doctoral degrees. Student enrollment averages near 32,000, making it the state's largest university. Since its founding over 230,000 students have graduated from OSU. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" with an additional, optional designation as a \"Community Engagement\" university. OSU is a land-grant university that also participates in the sea-grant, space-grant, and sun-grant research consortia; it is one of only four such universities in the country (University of Hawaii at Manoa, Cornell University and Pennsylvania State University are the others). OSU received $441 million in research funding for the 2017 fiscal year and consistently ranks as the state's top earner in research funding. ",

In 1999, USIA's broadcasting functions were moved to the newly created Broadcasting Board of Governors. Its cultural exchange and non-broadcasting information functions were assigned to the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of State. The agency was previously known overseas as the United States Information Service (USIS). Former USIA Director Alvin Snyder recalled in his 1995 memoir that \"the U.S. government ran a full-service public relations organization, the largest in the world, about the size of the twenty biggest U.S. commercial PR firms combined. Its full-time professional staff of more than 10,000, spread out among some 150 countries, burnished America‘s image and trashed the Soviet Union 2,500 hours a week with a 'tower of babble' comprised of more than 70 languages, to the tune of over $2 billion per year\". \"The biggest branch of this propaganda machine\" was the USIA.

      "description": "Lynn Poole (August 11, 1910 – April 14, 1969) was the creator and host of an early U.S. science television program, The Johns Hopkins Science Review (1948–1955), and the author of more than 20 popular science books. In 2002, Patrick Lucanio and Gary Coville wrote that \"In retrospect, Lynn Poole created one of those unique series that allowed television to fulfill its idealized mission as both an educational and an entertainment medium.\" The \"pioneering program\" made Poole a \"surprise star\". Marcel LaFollette argues that contemporary science television such as NOVA and the Discovery Channel are derived from the innovations of Poole and others. Poole was born in Eagle Grove, Iowa. He received his bachelor's degree from Western Reserve University in 1936, and a master's degree in 1937. In 1938 he joined the staff of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where he directed the education department. In 1941 he married Gray Johnson, then working as a journalist at The Evening Sun. Following service during World War II as a public relations officer for the VII Bomber Command, in 1946 he joined Johns Hopkins University as its first director of public relations. ",

      "description": "Henry Dreyfuss Brant (September 15, 1913 – April 26, 2008) was a Canadian-born American composer. An expert orchestrator with a flair for experimentation, many of Brant's works featured spatialization techniques. Brant was born in Montreal, to American parents (his father was a violinist), in 1913. Something of a child prodigy, he began composing at the age of eight, and studied first at the McGill Conservatorium (1926–29) and then in New York City (1929–34). He played violin, flute, tin whistle, piano, organ, and percussion at a professional level and was fluent with the playing techniques for all of the standard orchestral instruments. ",

The station operates on the assigned FM frequency of 89.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 13,500 watts. The studios are located in Dreiser Hall on the ISU campus. The tower and transmitter facilities are located in West Terre Haute, Indiana. Under the personal supervision of the \"Hoosier Schoolmaster of the Air,\" Dr. Clarence M. Morgan, who with his son Dr. Thomas O. Morgan helped build the station, WISU began broadcasting on April 1, 1964. WISU is licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission as a Class B FM station, which would allow a maximum power of 46,000 watts effective radiated power (ERP), using an antenna height of 156 meters. The original program schedule of student created live broadcasts is well documented in the annual reports written by Dr. Clarence M. Morgan, the Director of Radio Activities at Indiana State College, from 1934 to 1969, when he retired. ",

      "description": "KVIE, virtual channel 6 (VHF digital channel 9), is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station licensed to Sacramento, California, United States. The station is owned by KVIE, Inc., a community-based non-profit organization that is governed by a volunteer board of directors. KVIE's studios are located on West El Camino Avenue in the Natomas district of Sacramento, and its transmitter (a 2,000-foot (610 m) tall tower owned by Fox affiliate KTXL) is located in Walnut Grove, California. The station was incorporated in 1955 as Central California Educational Television (CCET) and first signed on the air on February 23, 1959. The letters \"VI\" in the KVIE call letters represent the Roman numerals for the station's then-channel number, \"6\", and the \"E\" stands for \"education\". During its early years, it only ran daily programming during the afternoon and evening hours (during the school year) and nearly all day on weekends. By the end of the 1970s, KVIE expanded its programming throughout the daytime hours, and in the mid-1980s moved to a 24-hour daily schedule. KVIE served as the default PBS member station via cable television for northwestern Nevada before KNPB signed on in 1983. ",

      "description": "The National Educational Radio Network (NERN) was a means of distributing radio programs in the United States between 1961 and 1970. With funding from the Ford Foundation, the network began broadcasting on six radio stations on April 3, 1961. A forerunner was formed in 1925 as the Association of College and University Broadcasting Stations, then renamed the National Association of Educational Broadcasters in 1934. In 1951 a grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation enabled the network to become the \"(NAEB) Tape Network\", based at the University of Illinois. ",

      "description": "William \"Benny\" Benjamin (July 15, 1925 – April 20, 1969), nicknamed Papa Zita, was an American musician, most notable as the primary drummer for the Motown studio band known as The Funk Brothers. He was a native of Birmingham, Alabama. Benjamin originally learned to play drums in the style of the big band jazz groups in the 1940s. In 1958, Benjamin was Motown's first studio drummer, where he was noted for his dynamic style. Several Motown record producers, including Berry Gordy, refused to work on any recording sessions unless Benjamin was the drummer and James Jamerson was the bassist. The Beatles singled out Benjamin's drumming style upon meeting Gordy in the UK. Among the Motown songs Benjamin performed the drum tracks for are early hits such as \"Money (That's What I Want)\" by Barrett Strong, \"Shop Around\" by The Miracles and \"Do You Love Me\" by The Contours; as well as later hits such as \"Get Ready\" and \"My Girl\" by The Temptations, \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\" by Stevie Wonder, \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" by Gladys Knight & the Pips, and \"Going to a Go-Go\" by The Miracles.

On his retirement, Creel was praised by his colleagues as an innovative pioneer on early Chinese civilization and as one who could write both for specialists and for the interested general public with cogency, lucidity, and grace. Herrlee G. Creel was born on January 19, 1905, in Chicago, Illinois. He attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate, graduating with a Ph.B. degree in 1926. He then continued on at Chicago as a graduate student studying Chinese philosophy, earning an A.M. in 1927, followed by a Ph.D. in 1929 with a dissertation entitled \"Sinism: A Study of the Evolution of the Chinese World-view\". He began his postdoctoral career as an assistant professor of psychology at Lombard College from 1929 to 1930. He was awarded fellowships by the American Council of Learned Societies (1930–1933), the Harvard-Yenching Institute (1931–1935) and the Rockefeller Foundation (1936, 1945 –1946). In 1936 he accepted a post at the University of Chicago, where he was an instructor in Chinese history and language until he was appointed Assistant Professor of early Chinese literature and institutions in 1937.

(Cyril) Scott Fletcher, was born July 28, 1904 in Sydney, Australia to Michael Scott and Winifred Sarah Fletcher. He attended Newington College in Sydney, Australia from 1916 to 1918 and then the University of Sydney, from 1919 to 1922. At Sydney University C. Scott Fletcher received a diploma in Economics and Commerce.During his enrollment at Sydney University, Fletcher joined Cayce-Paul Motors Limited, the Studebaker distributor in New South Wales, Australia. There he worked as a mechanic in the works and assembly plant. Fletcher eventually joined the Studebaker Corporation of Australasia Limited. At Studebaker, he worked his way up the corporate ladder and served in a variety of managerial positions at various international sites including: China, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States and Rhodesia. He eventually became the international vice-president of Studebaker, just prior to World War II. At Studebaker, Fletcher was able to learn the automobile industry, travel the globe and befriend the president of Studebaker, Paul Hoffman.It was Paul Hoffman who requested Fletcher be given leave from Studebaker to join United China Relief Inc. There, he became the Executive Vice Chairman of United China Relief Inc., in 1942, and helped raise over 7 million dollars for the Chinese allies of the United States.In the year 1942, Fletcher also joined the Committee for Economic Development (CED), in Washington D.C., and served as its Field Director from 1942 to 1943. In New York from 1943 to 1946 Fletcher served as the Executive Director of the Committee and from 1947 to 1952 he was a trustee. The goal of the Committee for Economic Development was to facilitate a quick transition from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. The aims of the Committee were to stimulate economic development and provide jobs. These goals were reached under the leadership of C. Scott Fletcher until his resignation in 1946 from both the Committee for Economic Development and also the Studebaker Corporation. In 1946 Fletcher was appointed as a trustee to CED, a position which he held until he was asked to join the Ford Foundation in 1951.While a trustee at the Committee for Economic Development, Fletcher was asked by William Benton, Publisher of Encyclopedia Britannica, to become the President of Encyclopedia Britannica Films Inc., Chicago, Illinois. With Encyclopedia Britannica Films, he oversaw the creation of films and filmstrips for classroom purposes. This marked the beginning of C. Scott Fletcher's career in education.C. Scott Fletcher remained President of Encyclopedia Britannica Films from 1946 to 1951. In late 1950, William Benton, vice-chairman of the Committee for Economic Development, talked with Paul Hoffman who had become the director of the Ford Foundation, about convincing C. Scott Fletcher to become president of an unnamed Fund. This fund was to be established through the Ford Foundation and with its focus on adult education. The unnamed fund in May of 1951 became the Fund for Adult Education. In January of 1951 C. Scott Fletcher joined the Ford Foundation, having resigned from Encyclopedia Britannica Films, and became president of the Fund for Adult Education. It was as president of the Fund for Adult Education that C. Scott Fletcher began his work in the field of non-commercial educational television .C. Scott Fletcher, during his ten years with the Fund for Adult Education, helped establish and fund the first thirty non-commercial television stations in the United States. He was instrumental in garnering support from civic and business leaders, government officials, educators and citizens for the establishment of ETV (educational television) stations across the country. He also helped to fund the first National Educational Television and Radio Program Center in 1954, which marked the beginning of the national program service. Under Fletcher's leadership, the Ford Foundation's Fund For Adult Education provided more than $11,000,000 for the advancement of educational television over a ten-year period. During his ten years at the Fund for Adult Education, 1951-1961, Fletcher remained a loyal advocate of non-commercial television as an educational vehicle.Eventually the Fund for Adult Education was reabsorbed by its parent, the Ford Foundation. Fletcher decided to retire from the field of education and educational television and establish his own management and communications consulting business in 1961, which he maintained until 1972.In 1964 Fletcher returned from retirement to become the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Educational Television Stations (ETS), a division of the National Association for Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) . ETS, under Fletcher, was responsible for the founding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) . CPB was signed into existence by President Lyndon B. Johnson, November 7, 1967, after the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 . The efforts of C.Scott Fletcher combined with those of ETS, NAEB, and the Carnegie Commission, were influential forces that enabled the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Fletcher served as a Chief Liaison Officer between ETS and NAEB from 1967-1971 and then in 1971 he retired from the field for a second time.After his final retirement, C. Scott Fletcher remained active in many causes such as the \"save the beaches\" campaign in his hometown in Florida.

      "description": "WHBQ (560 AM) – branded Sports 56 WHBQ – is a commercial sports radio station licensed to serve Memphis, Tennessee. Owned by Flinn Broadcasting, the station covers the Memphis metropolitan area, and is the local affiliate for Fox Sports Radio, the Memphis Redbirds, and Ole Miss Rebels football and basketball. The WHBQ studios and transmitter are located in the city of Memphis. Besides a standard analog transmission, WHBQ is available online. The station is also simulcast over the audio channel of WPGF-LP, VHF analog channel 6, a low-power television station licensed to serve Memphis. WPGF-LP's audio channel, transmitting at 87.75 MHz, lies within the FM band; as a result, WPGF-LP can and does operate as a radio station at 87.7 FM. On March 25, 1925, WHBQ first signed on the air. It was among the earliest stations in Memphis and had its studios in the historic Hotel Claridge. During the 1930s, it broadcast at 100 watts on 1370 kilocycles. ",

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Representative (1953–1961) and a U.S. Senator (1961–1978) from Montana. He was Montana's first U.S. Senator to be born in the state, and was Permanent Acting President pro tempore of the Senate, the only one to hold that position, from 1963 until his death in 1978. Metcalf was born in Stevensville, Montana, to Harold E. and Rhoda (née Smith) Metcalf. His father was the cashier of the First State Bank of Stevensville. He was raised on his family's farm. He graduated from Stevensville High School in 1928, and then studied at the University of Montana (then known as Montana State University, which is now the name of a different institution) where he played first-string tackle on the freshman football team.

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Lee Metcalf was born in 1911 in Stevensville, Montana. He attended Montana State University for one year and transferred to Stanford University where he majored in history and economics. He graduated from Montana State University law school in 1936 and entered private practice. He was elected representative to the 25th Montana Legislative Assembly from Ravalli County in the same year. In 1937 Metcalf resigned from the legislature to accept appointment as a Montana assistant attorney general.</p><p>During his tenure as an assistant attorney general, Metcalf campaigned extensively for Attorney General Harrison Freebourn who was seeking election to the U.S. Senate in the 1940 primary. During this period Metcalf also represented the Montana State Congress of Industrial Organizations Council from 1938 until 1941. In 1941, following Freebourn's defeat in the primary, Metcalf returned to private practice in Hamilton. Metcalf enlisted in the army in 1942 and was later commissioned. Following the war he served as a military government officer in Germany where he helped set up the civilian court and occupation police system. He also supervised repatriation and drafted the ordinances for and supervised local elections.</p><p>Metcalf was elected associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court in 1946, where he served until he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1952, succeeding Mike Mansfield in Montana's First (Western) Congressional District. After serving four terms in the House, Metcalf was elected to the Senate in 1960, succeeding James E. Murray.</p><p>Although Metcalf is best known for his work to protect the natural environment and regulate utilities, he composed and supported a wide variety of legislation. His prodigious legislative accomplishments are testimony to his parliamentary acumen.</p><p>Lee Metcalf worked throughout his career to protect the nation's natural resources from both wanton exploitation and destruction. He was an early proponent of water and air pollution control; research on the harmful effects of pesticides, strip mining, and highway construction; regulation of timber cutting and grazing; alternative energy development; and many other conservation issues. His efforts to preserve the nation's wild lands and rivers were productive and lauded by national conservation organizations. As a long-time member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Metcalf helped establish many wildlife refuges.</p><p>While Lee Metcalf was an ardent protector of the natural environment, he believed in the responsible development of resources. He supported rural cooperative efforts, public power projects, and diverse types of assistance to independent workers in agriculture and minerals.</p><p>Metcalf advocated the use of government resources to redress the injustices of an imperfect society and to broaden and strengthen access to information for all individuals. He proposed and worked for legislation concerning Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and veterans' benefits; aid to libraries, schools and small businesses; minimum wage laws; work safety laws; job training programs; consumer protection; and the return of control over their own lives to Native Americans.</p><p>Metcalf's long, adverserial relationship with the Montana Power Company and other utilities stemmed from his belief that the power industry held a monopolistic, unregulated control of an essential product. Lee Metcalf's and Vic Reinemer's book Overcharge delineates their position that the utilities exert tremendous influence throughout American society, yet are not subject to the democratic election process and are controlled by a small group of profiteers.</p><p>Closely related to Metcalf's efforts to regulate utility companies was his opposition to the growth of \"corporate statism.\" Especially in his capacity as chairman of the Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditure (later Reports, Accounting, and Management), and in close association with Vic Reinemer, Metcalf worked for disclosure of meaningful information, such as interlocking directorships, regarding corporate activity in regulated industries.</p><p>Congressional colleagues respected Lee Metcalf's thorough knowledge of the workings of government, knowledge which he used astutely throughout his career. In 1959 Metcalf helped establish the Democratic Study Group, an organization which instructed, mobilized, and coordinated liberal Democrats. As a member of the Government Operations Committee, Metcalf worked for many years, especially after Watergate activities spotlighted such concerns, to reorganize government to improve its efficiency and honesty.</p><p>Lee Metcalf enjoyed the cooperation of an able staff. He also provided experience to as many interns, the majority of whom were Montanans, as his time and office space would allow.</p><p>Vic Reinemer joined Metcalf's staff in 1961 and worked closely with him until Metcalf's death. Reinemer was born in Circle, Montana, in 1923, and graduated from Montana State University with a B.A. in journalism in 1948. He worked as a newspaper editor in Washington, D.C., for Freedom amp; Union Magazine in 1950 and 1951, and in North Carolina for the Charlotte News from 1950 until 1955. From 1955 until 1960 Reinemer worked as executive secretary for Senator Murray and then served until 1973 in the same position for Senator Metcalf. From 1973 until Metcalf's death in 1978, Reinemer was staff director of the Senate Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditures, which changed its name in 1975 to Reports, Accounting, and Management. Reinemer concentrated his energies on utility regulation and corporate ownership reporting.</p><p>Other long-time influential staff members include Merrill \"Brit\" Englund, Metcalf's administrative assistant, who worked for United Press Internatinnal and the Associated Press in Helena for six years before joining Metcalf's staff in 1953; Peggy McLaughlin, personal secretary, who worked for the Montana State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Montana Attorney General, and for Senator Murray before beginning her years with Metcalf; and Dorothy Tannenbaum, legislative assistant with special knowledge of education and Native American affairs. Ted Roe replaced Vic Reinemer as executive secretary in 1973. These staff members' contribution to Metcalf's work can most easily be noted by the many letters in the collection which they composed.</p><p>Lee Metcalf married Donna Hoover in 1938. He died in January 1978 during what he declared would be his last Senate term.</p><citation>From the guide to the Lee Metcalf Papers, 1934-1978, (Montana Historical Society Research Center)</citation></biogHist>",

      "description": "Charles Spurgeon Johnson (July 24, 1893 – October 27, 1956) was an American sociologist and college administrator, the first black president of historically black Fisk University, and a lifelong advocate for racial equality and the advancement of civil rights for African Americans and all ethnic minorities. He preferred to work collaboratively with liberal white groups in the South, quietly as a \"sideline activist,\" to get practical results. His position is often contrasted with that of W. E. B. Du Bois, who was a powerful and militant advocate for blacks and described Johnson as \"too conservative.\" During Johnson's academic studies and leadership of Fisk University during the 1930s and 1940s, the South had legal racial segregation and Jim Crow discriminatory laws and practices, including having disfranchised most black voters in constitutions passed at the turn of the century. Johnson was unwavering in personal terms in his opposition to this oppressive system, yet he worked hard to change race relations in terms of short-term practical gains. ",

Ford\" B6). A Republican, he was appointed to the Federal Communications Commission in 1957, and after the chairman, John C. Doerfer, was forced to resign after allegations of conflict of interest, President Dwight D. Eisenhower named him to take over as Chairman of the FCC. Ford served in that role from March 15, 1960 to March 1, 1961. During his time as the Chairman, he was praised for being a man of integrity. One media critic called him \"one of the most all-around competent commissioners ever to sit on the FCC\" (Gould D25). In late 1964, Ford suddenly left the FCC to become the president of a cable television trade association, the National Community Television Association, today known as the National Cable Television Association. In his new position as an advocate for the growing cable television industry, he was paid $50,000 a year (Kraslow 38). ",

      "description": "KANU is the flagship station of Kansas Public Radio (KPR), a seven-station network based in Lawrence at the University of Kansas. In addition to KANU (91.5 FM), KPR also operates full-power stations KANH in Emporia (at 89.7 FM), KANV in Olsburg (at 91.3 FM, serving Manhattan and Junction City), and KANQ in Chanute (at 90.3 FM); and low-power translators K210CR in Atchison (at 89.9 FM), and K258BT (99.5 FM) and K250AY (97.9 FM) in Manhattan. Together, the stations cover all of northeastern Kansas, as well as large portions of Missouri, including Kansas City. Flagship KANU provides much of the Kansas City area a second choice for NPR programming alongside KCUR (Lawrence is part of the Kansas City market). Its powerful 100,000-watt signal allows it to double as the main NPR station for the state capital, Topeka. ",

His followers, popularly known as \"Branchhead Boys,\" fervently supported Scott in all his campaigns and remained a force in North Carolina politics for more than a decade following his death. ",

His dissent in Briggs v. Elliott was foundational to Brown v. Board of Education. Waring was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Edward Perry Waring and Anna Thomasine Waties. He graduated second in his class with an Artium Baccalaureus degree from the College of Charleston in 1900. He married his first wife, Annie Gammel, in 1913. Their only daughter was Anne Waring Warren, who died without children. The couple moved into a house at 61 Meeting St. in 1915. Waring read law in 1901 and passed the South Carolina bar exam in 1902. He was in private practice of law in Charleston from 1902 to 1942 and an Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District of South Carolina from 1914 to 1921. He served as the city attorney for Charleston from 1933 to 1942, under Mayor Burnet R. Maybank. In 1938, he served as the campaign manager for Democratic Senator Ellison D. \"Cotton Ed\" Smith. Waring founded a law firm with D. A. Brockington. ",

      "description": "WJCT is a non profit organization based in Jacksonville, Florida, which operates PBS member television station WJCT (channel 7), NPR member radio station WJCT-FM (channel 89.9), and WJCT Online. In 1952, following a four-year-long freeze on awarding station licenses, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revised its channel allocation table and reserved 242 frequencies, including channel 7 in Jacksonville, for noncommercial educational use. In Jacksonville, podiatrist Dr. Heywood Dowling launched a campaign to bring educational television to the First Coast region. While many other public stations at the time were affiliated with universities, Dowling proposed that Jacksonville's station be owned and funded by the community. Civic leaders embraced the concept, and after years of fundraising, the FCC issued a construction permit for channel 7 on February 28, 1957. ",

Mitchell, Jane Mallett, John Drainie, Barry Morse, Christopher Plummer, James Doohan, and many others. Allan attempted to make the transition to television in the 1950s, but never matched the extraordinary success he'd reached in the medium of radio. He later became the first Artistic Director of the Shaw Festival (1963–65) and was a prolific freelance writer and guest commentator on CBC Radio and Television until his death. ",

      "description": "Wilbur Lang Schramm (August 5, 1907 – December 27, 1987), was a scholar and \"authority on mass communications\". He founded the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 1935 and served as its first director until 1941. Schramm was hugely influential in establishing communications as a field of study in the United States, and the establishing of departments of communication studies across U.S. universities. Wilbur Schramm is considered the founder of the field of Communication Studies. He was the first individual to identify himself as a communication scholar; he created the first academic degree-granting programs with communication in their name; and he trained the first generation of communication scholars. Schramm's mass communication program in the Iowa School of Journalism was a pilot project for the doctoral program and for the Institute of Communications Research, which he founded in 1947 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, now housed in the UIUC College of Media. At Illinois, Wilbur Schramm set in motion the patterns of scholarly work in communication study that continue to this day. Schramm was born in Marietta, Ohio, to a musical, middle-class family whose ancestry hailed from Schrammburg, Germany. His father Arch Schramm played the violin, his mother Louise the piano, and Wilbur Schramm himself played the flute. His father was a lawyer in Marietta, Ohio. Due to their Teutonic name, his father's legal practice suffered. Wilbur Schramm \"suffered from a stammer which at times severely hampered his speech, and which he never fully conquered\". Schramm developed a severe stutter at age five due to an improperly performed tonsillectomy. Schramm's stutter was traumatic to him and he avoided speaking in public because of it. Instead of giving the valedictory address at his high school graduation, Schramm played the flute. ",

OBU was established in 1910 under the original name of The Baptist University of Oklahoma. OBU is owned and was founded by the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma (BGCO). Prior to the creation of the Baptist University of Oklahoma by the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma in 1910, several other Baptist-affiliated schools were started in Oklahoma Territory. Oklahoma Baptist College in Blackwell began operation on September 4, 1901. The school fought financial problems throughout its history and closed in 1913. In the fall of 1907, the Baptists of Hastings, Oklahoma, Comanche County, Oklahoma and Mullins Baptist Associations opened Hastings Baptist College in the southwestern part of the state. A year later, the name was changed to Southwest Baptist College and then to Southwest Baptist Academy. It suffered similar financial challenges and ceased operation in 1912. Baptists in nearby Mangum were able to pay off debts of Southwest Baptist College and move the school to their city. It was reopened in the fall of 1912 in the First Baptist Church building and was called Southwestern Baptist College, then Western Baptist College. It was closed in 1915. ",

The company was founded by Sime Silverman in New York City in 1905 as a weekly newspaper reporting on theater and vaudeville. In 1933 it added Daily Variety, based in Los Angeles, to cover the motion-picture industry. Variety.com features breaking entertainment news, reviews, box office results, cover stories, videos, photo galleries and features, plus a credits database, production charts and calendar, with archive content dating back to 1905. Variety has been published since December 16, 1905, when it was launched by Sime Silverman as a weekly periodical covering theater and vaudeville with its headquarters in New York City. Silverman had been fired by The Morning Telegraph in 1905 for panning an act which had taken out an advert for $50. As a result, he decided to start his own publication \"that [would] not be influenced by advertising.\" With a loan of $1,500 from his father-in-law, he launched Variety as publisher and editor. In addition to The Morning Telegraph, other major competitors on launch were The New York Clipper and the New York Dramatic Mirror. ",

Born in rural Menlo Park, California, to two bohemian writers—his father was an Irish immigrant and his mother, a former schoolteacher, had relocated from Iowa—Cowell demonstrated precocious musical talent and began playing the violin at the age of five. After his parents' divorce in 1903, he was raised by his mother, Clarissa Dixon, author of the early feminist novel Janet and Her Dear Phebe. His father, with whom he maintained contact, introduced him to the Irish music that would be a touchstone for Cowell throughout his career. While receiving no formal musical education (and little schooling of any kind beyond his mother's home tutelage), he began to compose in his mid-teens. ",

WorldCat record id: 45206996</citation><p>Henry Cowell (1897-1965) was an American composer, writer, pianist, educator, lecturer, and publisher.</p><p>Initially schooled at home by his mother, Clarissa Dixon Cowell, he began music studies as a child in the San Francisco Bay area. Among his earliest mentors were Charles Seeger, with whom he began studying in 1914 at the University of California at Berkeley and the Irish Theosophist poet John Varian. Following a stint in the army in 1918-1919 and further study, Cowell embarked on an extensive series of tours throughout the United States, Europe, as well as the USSR, performing his own music and attracting publicity for his use of tone clusters and experimental keyboard techniques. A tireless advocate for contemporary music, Cowell formed the New Music Society of California, helping to promote such composers as Charles Ives, Carlos Chávez, John Becker, Carl Ruggles and Wallingford Riegger through the quarterly journal, New Music. Cowell's music defined many of the major developments of twentieth-century music, and he was among the earliest composers to endorse the view that the musical materials of the whole world, not just Western Europe, should be available to composers and inform their musical and cultural outlook. To this end, he studied comparative musicology in Berlin early on and he would continue these explorations with his wife, ethnomusicologist Sidney Robertson Cowell, (who, along with his stepmother Olive Cowell and composer Percy Grainger were instrumental in helping Cowell to gain early release from his imprisonment on a morals charge). Cowell taught at many institutions, most notably the New School for Social Research, where his students included John Cage and Lou Harrison. He also was a prolific writer, whose output included the books, New Musical Resources (1930), an exploration of modern compositional methods, and Charles Ives and his Music (1955), the first monograph about the composer (co-written with his wife).</p><citation>From the description of Henry Cowell papers, 1851-1994. (New York Public Library). WorldCat record id: 84671665</citation><p>Henry Cowell (March 11, 1897 - Dec. 10, 1965) was an American composer, writer, pianist, educator, lecturer and publisher. He was born to a poor family in Menlo Park, California, near San Francisco; Menlo Park remained his home until 1936. Cowell was mainly schooled at home by his mother and began his music studies at age five on the violin; he switched to piano within a few years and began composing around the time he was 10. Lewis Terman, a psychologist at Stanford University, began studying Cowell as an example of a child genius and used him as a case study subject for the development of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Another Stanford professor, Samuel Seward, arranged a fund to educate Cowell and to assist his family. Cowell began studying with Charles Seeger, among others, at the University of California at Berkeley in 1914. Another mentor Cowell met in his teens was the Irish Theosophist poet John Varian, whose texts Cowell set to music. Later in his life Cowell studied with musicians from non-western cultures to learn about their music.</p><p>Following a stint in the army in 1918-1919, Cowell concentrated on performing his own music. He began touring the United States and visited Europe for the first time in 1923, attracting publicity for his use of tone clusters and direct manipulation of piano strings; he drew more substantial interest from European composers such as Bela Bartók and Arnold Schoenberg.</p><p>In addition to his own musical activities, Cowell was a tireless advocate, publisher and presenter for other contemporary composers, most notably Charles Ives, but also for his friends John Becker, Carl Ruggles and Wallingford Riegger, among others. He formed the New Music Society of California, and was a major player in the Pan American Association of Composers, which helped publicize such composers as Carlos Chavez. Cowell also established the brand name New Music, a quarterly journal which also branched out into a record label and score publishing concern.</p><p>Cowell taught at many institutions during his life, most notably the New School for Social Research, but also at Columbia University, Eastman School of Music, Stanford University and the University of California. He wrote books, including New Musical Resources, an exploration of modern compositional methods, and Charles Ives And His Music, the first book about Ives (written with Sidney Robertson Cowell). Cowell also toured the world meeting other musicians and composers to facilitate intercultural exchange, at times under the sponsorship of the U.S. State Department and the Rockefeller Foundation</p><p>Cowell's music defined many of the major developments of twentieth-century music, and he was among the earliest composers to endorse the view that the musical materials of the whole world, not just Western Europe, should be available to composers and inform their musical and cultural outlook. In many ways his music and philosophy both exemplified and anticipated the musical aesthetics of the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries.</p><p>Source: Nicholls, David. \"Cowell, Henry (Dixon)\", Grove Music Online ed.

Strickland and Wallace Sabin at the University of California in Berkeley. He also studied with Walter Damrosch at the Institute of Musical Art in New York, and with Charles Seeger.</p><p>Cowell became the first American composer to visit Russia in 1928, after which, he studied ethnomusicology with Erich von Hornbostel in Berlin as a Guggenheim fellow. These persuits led him toward extensive study of ethnic musical materials.</p><p>Cowell made great use of tone clusters. He systematized the clusters as harmonic amplifications of tonal chords, and devised logical notation for them. He ultimately applied tone clusters to compositions for instrumental works (in addition to piano works), and also used them in many of his symphonic works.</p><citation>From the guide to the Henry Cowell collection of noncommercial recordings [sound recording], 1940-1953, (The New York Public Library.

      "description": "WAMU (88.5 FM) is a public news/talk station that services the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. It is owned by American University, and its studios are located near the campus in northwest Washington. WAMU has been the primary National Public Radio member station for Washington since 2007. WAMU began as an AM carrier-current student radio station, signing on July 28, 1951 on 1200 kHz, before shifting to 590 kHz in March 1952 and 610 kHz in November 1952. The station was heralded as a rebirth of the university's prior radio station, WAMC, which operated on 590 kHz for two years starting in January 1947. Although carrier-current stations are not granted a license or call sign by the FCC, it used \"WAMU\" as a familiar form of identification. The station aired a wide range of student-produced programming including music, news, sports, radio dramas, and debates. ",

CBS News television programs include the CBS Evening News, CBS Mornings, news magazine programs CBS News Sunday Morning, 60 Minutes, and 48 Hours, and Sunday morning political affairs program Face the Nation. CBS News Radio produces hourly newscasts for hundreds of radio stations, and also oversees CBS News podcasts like The Takeout Podcast. CBS News also operates the 24-hour digital news network CBSN. Up until April 2021, the president and senior executive producer of CBS News was Susan Zirinsky, who assumed the role on March 1, 2019. Zirinsky, the first female president of the network's news division, was announced as the choice to replace David Rhodes on January 6, 2019. The announcement came amid news that Rhodes would step down as president of CBS News \"amid falling ratings and the fallout from revelations from an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations\" against CBS News figures and Rhodes.

He was elected to the Senate in 1952, defeating incumbent Republican Senator James P. Kem.

The station is owned by the locally based Capital Media and broadcasts on 1330 kHz at 1 kilowatt daytime, 49 watts nighttime from a transmitter located on Van Schaick Island in the neighboring city of Cohoes. WHAZ's programming is also simulcasted on four FM stations on the fringes of the market. WHAZ is recognized as being one of the oldest radio stations in New York State and claims to be the Capital District's second-oldest station. It first signed on in the summer of 1922 using 790 kHz in a time-share agreement with WGY. The station was operated by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. At the behest of General Electric, which desired to operate its flagship station WGY with an unlimited schedule, WHAZ was eventually authorized to switch to 1300 kHz. The NARBA frequency shift of 1941 moved WHAZ to 1330 kHz, daytime-only operations (minus one night a week) in an historic three-way timeshare with another timeshare in New York City, The Jewish Daily Forward's WEVD (1330 AM) and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society's WBBR (1330 AM).

Berkeley is ranked among the world's top universities by major educational publications. A founding member of the Association of American Universities, Berkeley hosts many leading research institutes, including the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and the Space Sciences Laboratory. It founded and maintains close relationships with three national laboratories at Berkeley, Livermore and Los Alamos, and has played a prominent role in many scientific advances, from the Manhattan Project and the discovery of 16 chemical elements to breakthroughs in computer science and genomics. Berkeley is also known for political activism and the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s. ",

WorldCat record id: 48460307</citation><p>James Day was born on December 22, 1918, in Alameda, California. He earned an AB in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1941, and a postgraduate degree from Stanford University in 1951.</p><p>After serving as a Captain in the Army during World War Two, Day worked as the director of Public Affairs and Education for NBC, San Francisco from 1946 to 1949. He spent 1949 to 1951 in Tokyo, Japan, as a civilian radio specialist with the Army of Occupation. He then took a job as Deputy Director of Radio Free Asia from 1951 to 1953.</p><p>Immediately after leaving Radio Free Asia, Day received a phone call from the assistant to the president of Stanford University asking if he would be interested in applying for a job that was being developed by the Bay Area Public Television Association. Day was interested and about a week later, he became the founding director of KQED, San Francisco, the nation's sixth public television station.</p><p>Day served as the president and general manager of KQED from 1953 until 1969. Under his leadership, KQED won a worldwide reputation for its imaginative and bold programming and for its innovative fund raising. KQED set a new precedence for nightly news with its program Newsroom .</p><p>For fourteen years, Day hosted his own weekly program, Kaleidoscope, on which he interviewed many notable people including Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert Kennedy, Buster Keaton, Aldous Huxley, and Alexander Kerensky. Additionally, he conducted extended interviews with Eric Hoffer and Arnold Toynbee.</p><p>In 1969, Day left KQED to become president of National Educational Television (NET), then the national network of educational television with headquarters in New York City. When NET merged with New York's public television channel, WNDT, in 1970 to become WNET/Channel 13, Day became the president of the merged organizations. His name is closely associated with some of the NET programming of that period, including The Great American Dream Machine, An American Family, Banks and the Poor, and VD Blues .</p><p>In 1973, Day resigned as president of WNET due to his dissatisfaction with public television and the growing importance of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) . He founded his own production company, Publivision, Inc., which produced and syndicated to public stations all over the world a night interview program, Day At Night . The series of 130 half-hour shows brought Day together with many leaders in the arts, sciences, literature, sports, entertainment, and public service, such as Ray Bradbury, Aaron Copland, Alger Hiss, Muhammad Ali, Jason Robards, and Ralph Ellison.</p><p>Day's service with public television continued even after he had left for the private sector. He served three years on the original board of PBS and fourteen years on the original board of the Children's Television Workshop . He was one of the founders of the International Public Television Screening conference, chairman of the board of The Press and the Public Project, and president of Timely Productions.</p><p>In 1995, Day published the book, The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television, which outlines the history of public television from the early 1950s, through the turbulent sixties and seventies, to the modern problems that face the field in the 1990s.</p><p>Starting in 1976, Day served as Professor Emeritus at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in television and radio. He also continued to serve as president of Publivision, Inc., and as a consultant for various projects, which have in the past included trips to Africa, Asia and South America. From 2000 to 2008, Day was an advisor to CUNY-TV, the City University of New York's television station.</p><p>James Day died on April 24, 2008.</p><citation>From the guide to the James Day Papers, 1952-1996 and undated, 1969-1992, (Mass Media and Culture)</citation></biogHist>",

The union also represents some workers in the computer, telecommunications, broadcasting, and other fields related to electrical work. It was founded in 1891, two years before George Westinghouse won the electric current wars by lighting the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition with alternating current, and before homes and businesses in the United States had begun receiving electricity. It is an international organization, based on the principle of collective bargaining. Its international president is Lonnie R. Stephenson and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. ",

WorldCat record id: 84186913</citation><p>On October 13, 1997, Jennifer Gratz, an unsuccessful white applicant for the Fall 1995 term, and Patrick Hamacher, an unsuccessful white applicant for the Fall 1997 term, brought a lawsuit in district court against the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A). On December 3, 1997, Barbara Grutter, an unsuccessful white applicant for the Fall 1997 entering class, brought a similar suit against the Law School. The plaintiffs sued both the university and specific university officials, including President Lee Bollinger, President Emeritus James Duderstadt, and Law School Dean Jeffrey Lehman, in their individual and official capacities. Both cases were certified as class actions for purposes of reviewing the policies at issue.</p><p>The Center for Individual Rights (CIR), a nonprofit public interest law firm located in Washington, D.C., represented the plaintiffs, with the Minneapolis law firm of Maslon, Edelman, Borman, &amp; Brand serving as lead counsel. The CIR had been active in conducting lawsuits seeking to dismantle affirmative action in college admissions and racial preference in a variety of arenas, including a successful case against the University of Texas Law School ( Hopwood v. State of Texas ). The university's lead counsel for the suits was John Payton, a civil rights attorney of the Washington D.C. law firm of Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering, with local counsel provided by Butzel Long of Detroit.</p><p>The plaintiffs in the cases charged that the university unlawfully discriminated against them by taking race and ethnicity into account as a positive factor in admissions. They sought injunctive relief and monetary damages. The university took the position that the Constitution and civil rights statutes, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in its 1978 decision in the case of University of California v. Bakke, permitted it to consider race and ethnicity in its admissions in order to achieve the educational benefits of a diverse student body. (The Bakke decision stated that there must be a \"compelling governmental interest\" to justify the use of race in admissions. The university asserted that diversity was just such an interest.)</p><p>In both lawsuits, groups of students and citizens petitioned to intervene in support of the university's admissions policy. Although their intervention was initially denied by the district courts, in August 1999 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit allowed the intervention and made the student and citizen groups full parties in the case. The intervenors defended the university's policy on the basis that it was needed to remedy past and/or present discrimination against people of color. In the LS&amp;A case, the intervenors included 17 African-American and Latino students who applied or planned to apply to the university and the group Citizens for Affirmative Action Preservation. In the Law School case, the intervenors included 41 students and three groups: United for Equality and Affirmative Action, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means Necessary, and Law Students for Affirmative Action.</p><p>Many organizations and entities filed \"friend of the Court\" (amicus) briefs in the Court of Appeals for both sides of the case. Organizations filing briefs in support of the university's position included General Motors Corporation, the American Bar Association, the American Council on Education, the National Organization for Women (NOW) Legal Defense Fund, the Attorney General of Michigan, and a group of Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Intel, Pfizer and others. Organizations filing amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs included the National Association of Scholars.</p><p>On December 13, 2000, Judge Patrick Duggan ruled without a trial and granted summary judgment in the university's favor in the Gratz case. Finding that the pursuit of the educational benefits of diversity is a compelling governmental interest, he ruled that the university's current admissions policy, in place since 1999, was fully constitutional, but that its admissions policy from 1995 to 1998 was unconstitutional. In a separate opinion, Duggan rejected the intervenors' alternative argument defending the policy. CIR has petitioned to appeal the judgment about the current admissions process and the university has petitioned to cross-appeal the ruling on the unconstitutionality of the admissions process for the years 1995 to 1998.</p><p>From January 16 through February 16, 2001, a limited trial on the specifics of the Law School admissions process was held. On March 27, 2001, Judge Bernard Friedman issued a decision for Grutter finding that the educational benefits of diversity were not a compelling interest, and that the specifics of the Law School's policy were not \"narrowly tailored\" to that interest. He also struck down the intervenors' defense, saying that it was essentially based on remedying societal discrimination and impermissible. He issued an order that the Law School cease considering race in its admissions process. The university immediately appealed the ruling and filed a motion for a stay of injunction. On April 5, 2001, the Court of Appeals issued a stay of the District Court order, allowing the Law School to continue using its current admissions policy while the appeal proceeds.</p><p>In October 2001, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the plaintiffs' motion for hearing oral arguments en banc. The hearings were scheduled for December 2001. In May 2002 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held in the Grutter case that the Law School's admissions policy is constitutional, reversing the March 27, 2001 decision of Judge Friedman. From August 2002 to October 2002 petitions for certiorari, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to view the Grutter and Gratz case were filed. In December 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari before judgment on the Constitutional issue only in Gratz and granted certiorari in the Grutter case. Oral arguments were heard before the U.S. Supreme Court in Gratz and Grutter on April 1, 2003. A decision from the U.S. Supreme Court was delivered on June 23, 2003. In a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court justices upheld the University of Michigan Law School admissions policy ( Grutter v. Bollinger, et. al ) and in a 6-3 vote struck down the university's undergraduate admissions policy ( Gratz and Hamacher v. Bollinger, et. al). On July 18, 2003, the plaintiff in Grutter v. Bollinger et al. filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting to rehear the case. The petition for rehearing of Grutter was denied on August 25, 2003.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the University Michigan Office of Undergraduate Admissions has announced a new process for reviewing student applications that will include more individualized review. This process will be in place for those students applying for admissions for the Fall 2004 term.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Michigan admissions lawsuits collection, 1995-2003, (Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)</citation></biogHist>",

      "description": "Norman Lewis Corwin (May 3, 1910 – October 18, 2011) was an American writer, screenwriter, producer, essayist and teacher of journalism and writing. His earliest and biggest successes were in the writing and directing of radio drama during the 1930s and 1940s. Corwin was among the first producers to regularly use entertainment—even light entertainment—to tackle serious social issues. In this area, he was a peer of Orson Welles and William N. Robson, and an inspiration to other later radio/TV writers such as Rod Serling, Gene Roddenberry, Norman Lear, J. Michael Straczynski and Yuri Rasovsky. His work was very influential on successful creative and performing artists, including Ray Bradbury, Charles Kuralt, The Firesign Theatre, Robert Altman, and Robin Williams among many others. ",

He has been called America's \"poet laureate of radio.\" On May 8, 1945, his one-hour live broadcast on the occasion of the end of World War II, On A Note of Triumph, drew 60 million listeners; poet Carl Sandburg praised it as \"one of the all-time great American poems.\"</p><p>Corwin is also the author of several books, including Holes In A Stained Glass Window (1978) and Trivializing America (1983), and his script for the movie Lust For Life (1957) was nominated for an Oscar. His television credits include his 1971 series \"Norman Corwin Presents.\" In the 1990s he began a new series of radio program for National Public Radio, whose casts have included William Shatner, Jack Lemmon, Charles Kuralt, Martin Landau, Hume Cronyn, and Charles Durning.</p><p>As of 2008 Corwin was still very active in his field, writing a monthly column on media, chairing two award committees for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, and serving as a Writer in Residence at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication.</p><p>Corwin was recognized many times over his career for his achievements; his awards include a Peabody (1941, the first year they were awarded), the One World Award (1946), a duPont-Columbia Award, and an Honorary Doctorate from Lincoln College (1990). He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1993, and in 2006 a documentary film on his life ( A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin ) won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Feature).</p><p>\"I have no apology to make for the affirmative tone of these scripts. I am convinced we will get where we want to go. It will be be grim en route, but I think there is nothing to be said for cynicism and despair, and everything to be said for getting out and working toward a better world.\" -- from the foreword to Untitled and Other Radio Dramas</p><p>[Portions of this biographical sketch adapted from Norman Corwin's official website and his USC Annenberg Faculty Page.]</p><citation>From the guide to the Norman Corwin Papers, 1931-1967, (Special Collections Research Center, Syracuse University Libraries)</citation></biogHist>",

      "description": "Founded in 1922 by Foster G. McGaw (1897-1986), the American Hospital Supply Corporation (AHSC) served as a major supplier of health care products to hospitals in the United States and around the world through subsidiaries for over half a century. The AHSC maintained its position of leader in the health care industry until the corporation was acquired by competitor Baxter Travenol in a merger on November 25, 1985.The AHSC dominated the hospital supply field during the 1930s and 1940s by changing the way hospital supplies were marketed, designating regional salesman who made frequent sales calls. The AHSC continued to dominate the field by diversifying its product line and later by pursuing vertical integration of suppliers.The 1950s and 1960s was a period of strong growth for the AHSC. In 1953, the AHSC reported sales surpassing $37.5 million. Ten years later, sales had jumped to $150 million. By 1964, the AHSC sold to 19 out of 20 hospitals in America. The AHSC also employed one out of every 46 workers in America as well. While the tremendous success enjoyed by the AHSC was a result of the corporations strong leadership, the growth of the hospital industry also played a vital role increasing sales for the AHSC. From 1946 to 1962, the number of hospital beds rose 15%. During that same time, hospital admissions rose by 70%.Throughout the history of the AHSC, Foster G. McGaw played a prominent role in the direction of the corporation. McGaw's influence on the day-to-day operations of the AHSC lessened as the corporation expanded and branched out into manufacturing during the 1960s and 1970s. Despite McGaw's waning influence within the AHSC executive structure, he still maintained a role of father figure to the corporation.For more information about the AHSC, see Growth Through Service: The Story of the American Hospital Supply Corporation by Frederick D. Sturdivant (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970). -- From the guide to the American Hospital Supply Corporation Records, 1920-1986, (Northwestern University Archives)",

      "description": "Österreichischer Rundfunk (English: Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, ORF) is an Austrian national public service broadcaster. Funded from a combination of television licence fee revenue and limited on-air advertising, ORF is the dominant player in the Austrian broadcast media. Austria was the last country in continental Europe after Albania to allow nationwide private television broadcasting, although commercial TV channels from neighbouring Germany have been present in Austria on pay-TV and via terrestrial overspill since the 1980s. The first unregulated test transmissions in Austria began on 1 April 1923 by Radio Hekaphon, run by the radio pioneer and enthusiast Oskar Czeija (de; 1887–1958), who applied for a radio license in 1921; first in his telephone factory in the Brigittenau district of Vienna, later in the nearby TGM technical college. September 2, it aired a first broadcast address by Austrian President Michael Hainisch. One year later, a powerful transmitter, designed by the German Telefunken company, was installed on the roof of the former War Ministry building on Ringstraße in central Vienna. ",

      "description": "Judith Cary Waller (February 19, 1889 – October 28, 1973) was an American broadcasting pioneer. Despite the fact that she knew nothing about radio at the time, she became the first station manager of Chicago radio station WMAQ when it went on the air in 1922. She is believed to be the first female radio station manager in the United States. During her tenure as station manager, Waller was responsible for obtaining broadcast rights for Chicago Cubs home games for WMAQ and for hiring Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll as Amos 'n' Andy after they left WGN radio over syndication rights. Waller tried to interest the CBS radio network in the program with no success. NBC brought the program to its Blue Network three years before its purchase of WMAQ in 1931. Waller was also responsible for the long-running discussion program University of Chicago Round Table on radio. The program began at WMAQ; it was then heard on the NBC Radio Network for over twenty years. She was also active in various educational programs, having started a children's radio club centered around the educational programs broadcast by WMAQ; there were more than 275,000 children enrolled in the club with more than 100 area schools participating in the program. Waller also began a program at Northwestern University to provide professional training to college students interested in broadcasting as a profession. ",

      "description": "The Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) was a jazz combo established in 1952 that played music influenced by classical, cool jazz, blues and bebop. For most of its history the Quartet consisted of John Lewis (piano), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Percy Heath (double bass), and Connie Kay (drums). The group grew out of the rhythm section of Dizzy Gillespie's big band from 1946 to 1948, which consisted of Lewis and Jackson along with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Kenny Clarke. They recorded as the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951 and Brown left the group, being replaced on bass by Heath. During the early-to-mid-1950s they became the Modern Jazz Quartet, Lewis became the group's musical director, and they made several recordings with Prestige Records, including the original versions of their two best-known compositions, Lewis's \"Django\" and Jackson's \"Bags' Groove\". Clarke left the group in 1955 and was replaced as drummer by Connie Kay, and in 1956 they moved to Atlantic Records and made their first tour to Europe. Under Lewis's direction, they carved their own niche by specializing in elegant, restrained music that used sophisticated counterpoint inspired by baroque music, yet nonetheless retained a strong blues feel. Noted for their elegant presentation, they were one of the first small jazz combos to perform in concert halls rather than nightclubs. They were initially active into the 1970s until Jackson quit in 1974 due to frustration with their finances and touring schedule, but re-formed in 1981. They made their last released recordings in 1992 and 1993, by which time Kay had been having health issues and Mickey Roker had been his replacement drummer while Kay was unavailable. After Kay's death in 1994, the group operated on a semi-active basis, with Percy Heath's brother Albert Heath on drums until the group disbanded permanently in 1997. ",

The station is owned by Arizona State University and operated by ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. KAET's studios are located at the Cronkite School's facility at ASU Downtown Phoenix, and its transmitter is located on South Mountain on the south side of Phoenix. Its signal is relayed across Arizona on a network of 13 translator stations. In late 1959, as it was preparing to build new facilities for itself, Phoenix commercial television station KVAR offered to sell its old transmitter on South Mountain, valued at $150,000, to ASU for $30,000. The offer jumpstarted plans to build an educational television station in Phoenix and prompted the Arizona Board of Regents to authorize expenditures for the transmitter and additional equipment in January 1960.

He was a member of the founding board of NPR and the author of its original \"mission statement,\" the National Public Radio Purposes. As NPR's first director of programming Siemering helped shaped its flagship program All Things Considered into an influential and enduring fixture of American media. After a decades-long career in public radio, Siemering embarked on a second career of nurturing independent radio in the developing world. William Siemering grew up in rural Wisconsin. As a student in a two-room school outside of Madison, he listened to the \"Wisconsin School of the Air.\" These twice-a-day radio programs produced by WHA brought educators from the University of Wisconsin into isolated country schools throughout the state. Siemering would later observe: \"As early as first grade, radio both educated me and spurred my imagination.\" ",

Lausche attended St. Vitus Grade School grades one to four, St. Francis Grade School in grade five and Madison Grammar School grades six to eight. He then went to Central Institute Preparatory School. He dropped out of school in 1911, when his older brother died, to help support his family. He played baseball locally when not working, and was recruited as a third baseman to the amateur White Motor team, which won a national championship. He was noticed by scouts and reported to the Duluth White Sox in Duluth, Minnesota, of the Class D Northern League in the spring of 1916. He started the season batting .422, but developed trouble hitting curve balls, and was released after 31 games. He signed with a semi-pro team in Virginia, Minnesota. He performed poorly for two weeks before returning to Cleveland, and amateur ball. ",

      "description": "The Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT; Turkish: Türkiye Radyo ve Televizyon Kurumu) is the national public broadcaster of Turkey, founded in 1964. Around 70% of TRT's funding comes from a tax levied on electricity bills and a license tax on television and radio receivers. As these are hypothecated taxes, as opposed to the money coming from general government funds, the principle is similar to that of the television licence levied in a number of other countries, such as the BBC in the United Kingdom. The rest of TRT's funding comes from government grants (around 20%), with the final 10% coming from advertising. TRT was for many years the only television and radio provider in Turkey. Before the introduction of commercial radio in 1990, and subsequently commercial television in 1992, it held a monopoly on broadcasting. More recent deregulation of the Turkish television broadcasting market produced analogue cable television. Today, TRT broadcasts around the world, especially in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Australia. ",

      "description": "Rupert Vance Hartke (May 31, 1919 – July 27, 2003) was a Democratic United States Senator from Indiana from 1959 until 1977. Hartke won election to the Senate after serving as the mayor of Evansville, Indiana. In the Senate, he supported the Great Society and became a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War. Hartke ran for president in the 1972 Democratic primaries but withdrew after the first set of primaries. He left the Senate after being defeated in his 1976 re-election campaign by Richard Lugar. Hartke was born on May 31, 1919 in Stendal, Pike County, Indiana, the son of Ida Mary (Egbert), an organist, and Hugo Leonard Hartke, a teacher. His paternal grandparents were German, as were all of his maternal great-grandparents. He attended public schools in Stendal. He graduated from Evansville College (now the University of Evansville) in 1940, and from 1942 until 1946 Hartke served in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, rising from seaman to lieutenant. Hartke graduated from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law in 1948. ",

      "description": "George William Brain was an Australian politician and member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. He was the longest-serving member for Willoughby, serving from 1943 until his retirement in 1968. Brain was recognised as one of the primary forces in establishing the Free Library Movement in New South Wales. Brain was born 18 January 1893 in Picton. The eldest of nine children, he left school at 13 years of age to work in Scone dairying. At about 20 years of age, he moved to Sydney to look for work and delivered milk at Mascot until all his possessions were stolen forcing him to return home to his parents at Mudgee. These early hardships were critical in forming the substance of the man and Brain was left with a resolute determination to educate himself and a realisation of the importance of access to education to all people regardless of their wealth and status. Such experience motivated his subsequent passion for the free library movement and its importance in society. ",

      "description": "Daniel David Rostenkowski (January 2, 1928 – August 11, 2010) was a United States Representative from Chicago, serving from 1959 to 1995. He became one of the most powerful legislators in Washington, especially in matters of taxation, until he went to prison. A Democrat and son of a Chicago alderman, Rostenkowski was for many years Democratic Committeeman of Chicago's 32nd Ward, retaining this position even while serving in Congress. In Washington, D.C., he rose by virtue of seniority to the rank of Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in 1981, just as the Reagan Revolution marginalized many other Democratic politicians. As Chairman of Ways and Means, he played a critical role in formulating tax policy during the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan, including the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which cut the top federal bracket to 50%, and the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which further lowered it to 28% and reduced the number of brackets to only two. He was also involved in trade policy, as well as reforms of the welfare system, health care and Social Security programs. ",

      "description": "The United States Army Band, also known as \"Pershing's Own\", is the premier musical organization of the United States Army, founded in 1922. Before 2002, the United States Army Band was the only Washington-based military band to have participated in a theater of foreign combat operations. There are currently nine official performing ensembles in the unit: The U.S. Army Concert Band, The U.S. Army Ceremonial Band, The U.S. Army Chorus, The U.S. Army Blues, The U.S. Army Band Downrange, The U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, The U.S. Army Strings, The U.S. Army Voices, and The U.S. Army Brass Quintet. The United States Army Band was established on 25 January 1922 by General of the Armies John J. Pershing, Army Chief of Staff in emulation of European military bands he heard during World War I. In its early years, the band was featured on RCA, CBS, the Mutual Broadcasting Network, and other networks. The band also completed four national tours between 1928 and 1931 and was noted for its professionalism during a trip to Spain for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929. ",

The station is managed by Window To The World Communications, Inc., owner of WTTW, one of Chicago's two Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Public television stations. WFMT is also the primary station of the WFMT Radio Network, and the Beethoven and Jazz Networks. WFMT transmits from the Willis (Sears) Tower. A feature of this commercial station is that it airs no pre-recorded (by non-station hosts) advertising on-air. A brief attempt at introducing pre-recorded commercial advertising in the early 1990s, the only time in its history, proved unpopular with listeners. All advertising on the station is currently read exclusively by WFMT's on-air hosts. ",

      "description": "Francis Condie Baxter (May 4, 1896 – January 18, 1982) was an American scholar and television personality. An authority on Shakespeare with a doctorate in literature from Cambridge University, he was a highly popular professor of English Literature at the University of Southern California who brought literature, science, and the arts to millions in the United States via television and film. Baxter hosted the Emmy Award-winning CBS series Shakespeare on TV beginning in 1954, as well as the ABC drama series Telephone Time in 1957 and 1958, the US broadcast of the BBC's 15-part presentation of Shakespeare's history plays, An Age of Kings, in 1961, and NBC's The Bell Telephone Hour throughout the 1960s. Additional Baxter television series for CBS included Renaissance on TV (1956-57), devoted to classical philosophy, literature, and art, and Now and Then (1954-55), which enlightened viewers on subjects ranging from Altimira cave drawings to Elizabethan naval battles. Baxter's Emmy Award-winning Harvest on NBC in the mid-1950s highlighted great achievements in art, literature, public affairs, and science. In 1966, Baxter hosted a popular TV series called The Four Winds to Adventure, featuring filmmakers exploring little-known areas of the world, crossing continents and oceans to explore the histories and customs of local people or the animals unique to a particular region. The Written Word, a 15-part series on the history of books and printing featuring Baxter as presenter, aired nationwide in 1958 on both educational and commercial networks including ABC. Baxter was a frequent guest star on TV shows in the 1950s and 60s, often portraying himself since he was so well-known throughout America. His TV acting credits included The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Playhouse 90, The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show, Mr. Novak, and more than a dozen others. ",

      "description": "WCBS (880 AM, \"WCBS Newsradio 880\") is a radio station licensed to New York City and is owned and operated by Audacy, Inc. WCBS's studios are located in the combined Audacy facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood of lower Manhattan and its transmitter is located on High Island in the Bronx. Its 50,000-watt clear channel signal can be heard at night throughout much of the eastern United States and Canada. The station's history traces back to 1924, when Alfred H. Grebe started WAHG at 920 AM. WAHG was a pioneering station in New York, and was one of the first commercial radio stations to broadcast from remote locations including horse races and yachting events. Two years later, in 1926, Alfred Grebe changed the station's call sign to WABC (for his Atlantic Broadcasting Company) after concluding a business arrangement with the Ashland Battery Company (which had owned the call sign for a station in Asheville, North Carolina) and moved his studios to West 57th Street, which would not be the last time the station would operate from 57th Street.

      "description": "Charles Franklin Kettering (August 29, 1876 – November 25, 1958) sometimes known as Charles \"Boss\" Kettering was an American inventor, engineer, businessman, and the holder of 186 patents. He was a founder of Delco, and was head of research at General Motors from 1920 to 1947. Among his most widely used automotive developments were the electrical starting motor and leaded gasoline. In association with the DuPont Chemical Company, he was also responsible for the invention of Freon refrigerant for refrigeration and air conditioning systems. At DuPont he also was responsible for the development of Duco lacquers and enamels, the first practical colored paints for mass-produced automobiles. While working with the Dayton-Wright Company he developed the \"Bug\" aerial torpedo, considered the world's first aerial missile. He led the advancement of practical, lightweight two-stroke diesel engines, revolutionizing the locomotive and heavy equipment industries. In 1927, he founded the Kettering Foundation, a non-partisan research foundation. He was featured on the cover of Time magazine on January 9, 1933. Charles was born in Loudonville, Ohio, United States, the fourth of five children of Jacob Henry Kettering and Martha (Hunter) Kettering. Poor eyesight gave him headaches in school. After graduation he followed his sister Emma into a teaching position at Bunker Hill School. By all accounts he was an engaging and innovative teacher. He attracted students to evening scientific demonstrations on electricity, heat, magnetism, and gravity. ",

WorldCat record id: 270671960</citation><p>Born on January 10, 1910 in Lyon, the French conductor and composer, Jean Martinon entered the Lyon and Paris conservatoires to study the violin. At Lyon, his teacher was Maurice Foundray and at the Paris Conservatory, he studied violin technique with Jules Boucherit. While at the Paris conservatory, Martinon took composition with Albert Roussel and Vincent d'Indy. After completing the composition courses, he studied conducting with Charles Munch and Désormière. He graduated from the Paris Conservatory in 1928, winning a premier prix.</p><p>Martinon's familiarity with conducting started in France, followed by various appointments in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. In 1946, he embarked on a conducting career directing the Concerts du Conservatoire in Paris and the Bordeaux Symphony. The successful debut with the LPO led to his appointment as associate conductor of the orchestra in 1947. From 1947-1950 Martinon directed the Radio Eireann orchestra, Dublin and in 1951, he returned to Paris to conduct the Concerts Lamoureux until 1957. From 1957-1959, Martinon conducted the Israel Philharmonic. His appointment as the next conductor of the Düsseldorf Symphony occurred in 1959. Martinon was in Düsseldorf until 1963 when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra selected him as their music director, a position he held until 1968. During that same year, he returned to France to direct the French National Radio Orchestra and served as the principal conductor of the Hague Residentie–Orkest from 1974 until shortly before his death in 1976.</p><p>Martinon's extensive experience as a composer led to his approach to conducting. The Symphoniette pour orchestre á cordes, piano, harpe et timbales, op. 16, from 1935, is one of three first attempts at composition. After enlisting in the war, Martinon's imprisonment in a German camp, Stalag IX A, resulted in several new compositions, Psaume 136, le Chant des Captifs, Musique d'Exil, Sonatina No.3, Sonatina No. 4 for wind instruments, and various choral works. In 1946, the city of Paris awarded a prize to his composition le Chant des Captifs. After the war, other notable compositions include Symphonie no. 3 (Irlandaise), the Concerto no. 2 pour violin et orchestre, op. 5, dedicated to Szeryng, and the Concerto pour cello et orchestre, op. 52, composed for Pierre Fournier. For the stage Martinon composed two works, the ballet Ambohimanga ou la Cité Bleue and in 1949 the opera Hécube with a libretto by Serge Moreux. Symphony no.4 Altitudes was the outcome of a commission from the Chicago Symphony to commemorate its 75th anniversary.</p><p>Martinon had recently taken on a position at the Paris Conservatory to teach conducting when he died from a serious illness on March 1, 1976.</p><citation>From the guide to the Jean Martinon papers, 1923-1994, (Music Library)</citation></biogHist>",

Plans for the new library were underway when the university's first President, William Rainey Harper, passed away in 1906. To honor his service to the university, it was decided that the new library would be dedicated to his memory. Construction began in 1910 when the first cornerstone was laid. The building was completed in June of 1912, when the first dedication ceremony took place. Harper Memorial Library served as the main library for the university until the Regestein Library opened in September of 1970. At this time, Harper Library and Wiebolt Hall (originally constructed in 1928) were renovated to preserve their unique architecture and make them better able to meet the university's growing needs. The rededication ceremony in 1973 marked the completion of these renovations and the transformation of the Harper Memorial Library from the university's main library to the new College Center, designed to be the distinctive home for the undergraduate College.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

From its initial concept, presented in 1924 by President Burton, the residential hall has had a core aim to create a community within the larger University. The neo-Gothic building south of the Midway is comprised of six houses: Dodd-Mead, Chamberlin, Vincent, Coulter, Linn-Mathews, and Salisbury.</p><p>Jonathan Fanton was Resident Master of Burton-Judson Courts from 1978 to 1982. Under Fanton's efforts, the Faculty Fellows program of the residence hall took form. Fanton invited faculty members to become involved in the social events of the residence hall, attend special dinners in their honor with small groups of students, and provide personalized mentorship to incoming freshman residents. Fanton also led the organization of a momentous fiftieth anniversary celebration of the residence hall in November 1981.</p><p>Harold and Marlene Richman led Burton-Judson Courts from 1982 to 1992 as Resident Masters. They inherited Fanton's burgeoning Faculty Fellows program and built its ongoing, yearly success. Under the Richmans, a wide variety of resident activities and quarterly events flourished, including Cabaret Nights, the B-J Olympics, and the B-J Players' yearly musical theater productions. The B-J newsletter, Courtside, was started in 1984 and sent to the Faculty Fellows, among others, to keep them informed of the many events occurring in their adoptive residence hall.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

Lecture-Study Department speakers went on tours throughout the Midwest to present evening and weekend courses. The Class-Study Department provided off-campus instruction in the city, offering courses similar to those available on campus; in the early years of the twentieth century, Class-Study began giving courses in subject areas requested by specific groups of people. Basic and remedial courses by mail came under the jurisdiction of Correspondence-Study. By 1897 the other three units-Examination, Library, and Training-had been absorbed by the first three; a department devoted to Bible study had been dropped even more quickly. Not until 1905, when the American Institute of Sacred Literature merged with the Extension, was Bible study restored.</p><p>In 1900 the Extension faculty lost its separate and statutory existence. The Board of University Extension assumed governing responsibility until 1916, when the Extension's administration and governance reverted to its Director.</p><p>Especially during the first quarter-century of its existence, the Extension served teachers and aspiring teachers. In 1898, aided by a grant from Mrs. Emmons Blaine, the University organized the downtown College of Teachers. Two years later it merged with the Class-Study Department under the name University College. University College was conceived as \"an arrangement for selecting and conducting courses of study at a place and time convenient for those who cannot attend ordinary courses at the Quadrangles.\" By 1911 the Lecture-Study Department had also been incorporated into University College, and its circuit riding program was discontinued. The Correspondence-Study Department remained part of the Extension and in April 1924 was renamed the Home-Study Department.</p><p>Beginning in the 1920s, but particularly during the 1930s and 1940s, University College developed educational programs in cooperation with specific professional groups, among them the American Chemical Society and the American Institute of Meat Packers. Other specialized courses included those for mechanical and electrical engineers as well as for members of the printing and lithographic industries. During this same period University College expanded its services by tailoring courses to the needs of businessmen, civic leaders, and government administrators. Innovative offerings in the liberal arts, particularly the Great Books series and the Basic Program in Liberal Education for Adults, proved to be extremely popular. Capitalizing on the success Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler had with the Great Books courses, the Basic Program was a four-year liberal arts training program designed around group discussions and lectures on classical and modern literature. Other programs, such as the Institute of Statistics and the Institute of Public Service, survived only briefly in wartime conditions.</p><p>By the 1960s, University Extension enrollment had declined precipitously from the two previous decades. After 1963-64 the Home-Study Department ceased to exist, and the Downtown Center closed in 1974. By 1982 the University Extension had become part of the Center for Continuing Education. Though Its programs and course offerings have been reduced from earlier years, this entity continues to offer adult educational services, most of them non-credit, in the following areas: liberal education, including the Basic Program; business and professional courses, particularly in publishing, communications, and marketing; and higher education, including faculty symposia and seminars.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. University Extension. Records, 1892-1979, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>Primavera was a feminist literary magazine founded at the University of Chicago in 1975. It was conceived of by Janet Ruth Heller, Celia Josephson, and Deborah Gordon Fisher, and was proposed at the first meeting of the University of Chicago Feminist Organization. The intention was to give women an outlet for their creative work and also to counterbalance another campus publication, Wild Onions, which at the time published work mainly by men. The magazine had several unique attributes from its inception, particularly the invitation extended to all contributing authors and artists to sit on its editorial board, and the commitment to providing feedback for manuscripts that were not selected for publication. These practices could not be sustained for the life of the magazine, however, and by Issue 8 it was operating with a 6-person editorial board. In the mid-1980s the policy of returning all manuscripts with feedback was modified and authors given the option to request comments on their work.</p><p>Initially a student organization, the magazine received funding from the University, though that had to be supplemented by grants and loans to cover printing costs. In the 1980s Primavera began to have difficulty in continuing to secure University funding due to their women-only acceptance policy, though it remained affiliated with the University of Chicago until 1990. When the magazine went its own way, a nonprofit corporation was established (Moveable Type, Inc.), under whose auspices operations continued. It was around this time that Primavera began accepting submissions from men, though the focus remained on the lives and experiences of women.</p><p>Primavera came into being among many similar publications, among them Black Maria, Calyx, and Sing, Heavenly Muse! While these were all in some sense women's literary journals, they varied in focus. Primavera is notable for its lack of political content; very few essays were published, and the editorial focus was on the artistic merit of the pieces selected. The magazine was more concerned with reflecting the experiences of women than with encouraging activism or overt political messaging. The women reflected in its pages were often older than the demographic reflected by many feminist magazines, were more likely to come from the Midwest (or other areas besides the Northeast and West Coast, which were well represented in the mainstream feminist movement and its associated publications), and there was less of an emphasis on lesbian issues or experiences in Primavera than in some journals.</p><p>Issues for the feminist movement at large were also issues for Primavera. That Primavera was a Midwestern magazine placed it somewhat outside the (largely coastal) mainstream of the feminist movement. There was some initial difficulty in getting the magazine reviewed in Ms., which the editors may have felt had to do with the differing values, experiences, and needs of women in large coastal cities and women in the Midwest and south.</p><p>The magazine was the recipient of multiple Illinois Arts Council grants and literary awards, awards from Chicago Women in Publishing, and a Puffin Foundation grant used to translate poems by women from around the world. Notable authors who appeared in its pages include Louise Erdrich, 1997 Pulitzer Prize winner Lisel Mueller, Pamela Gemin, Michael Lee West, Diane Seuss, Lori Ostlund, and Chitra Divakaruni.</p><p>Members of Primavera's editorial board undertook other publishing-related work as well. In 1986 designer Lisa Grayson and editor Ruth Young worked on a side project preparing and publishing a booklet of early poems by Margaret Pearce Rummel, entitled The Other Side of the Hill. Grayson also work as a designer for other periodicals.</p><citation>From the guide to the Primavera. Records, 1975-2006, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>After the initial money-raising effort for $400,000 to complement John D. Rockefeller's gift of $600,000 (which was to establish \"a new institution of higher learning in the West\" under the auspices of the American Baptist Education Society), public solicitation of funds played a very small part in building up the endowment of the young University of Chicago. Wealthy subscribers, headed by Mr. Rockefeller, provided the major share of necessary funds. Prior to 1924, the only fund-drive involving mass contributions from alumni and friends was the Harper Memorial Library Fund (begun 1908) when $250,000 was raised to complement the sum of $750,000 pledged by Mr. Rockefeller [see President's Papers 1889-1925.</p><p>In 1924 when the University announced a public campaign to double its endowment, many people including alumni were genuinely surprised that this University, which had by President Harper's wishes opened its doors in 1892 as if long established, should have pressing financial needs. The public assumed that the University was under the perpetual patronage of the Rockefellers and various wealthy Chicagoans. In fact, the University itself had not made any significant attempt to cultivate giving among its alumni--who were, after all, not yet strong in numbers. The 1924-26 Development Campaign was thus the first major public as well as private fund drive.</p><p>In 1941, with the experience of the 1924-26 campaign behind it, the University initiated another major development campaign to coincide with its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration. This too was a new departure since previous anniversary celebrations (or celebrations of \"Founder's Day\" as they were first called) had not been explicitly connected with development. As originally conceived, the Fiftieth Anniversary Committee on Development was a group of trustees appointed to oversee the Anniversary plans. It was, however, the Executive Committee of the Committee on Development under the direction of the Executive Chairman (a trustee) which provided the coordinating core for the 1941 events; the other members of this committee included the President of the University, the Executive Director the directors of the Alumni Foundation, the Anniversary Celebration, Foundations, Publicity, the Citizen's Committee, and various other administrative and staff personnel.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. Development Campaigns and Anniversaries. Records, 1896-1941, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>The University of Chicago administers competitions that are sponsored both by the university itself and by outside groups or private endowments. The competitions represented in this collection are mostly privately-endowed prizes, awarded by the university to University of Chicago students. A brief account of some of the more notable prizes follows.</p><p>The Academy of American Poets Prize was established in 1955 by the academy for students at colleges and universities across the country. Participating schools can set certain standards for the competition, though no restrictions on poetic format/form are allowed. The prize is still in existence, but the University of Chicago no longer participates.</p><p>The Chicago Folklore Prize originally honored any contribution to folklore studies – essay, monograph, collection of material etc. It was established in 1904 by the American Folklore Society. The prize is still awarded, now for book-length works.</p><p>The David Blair McLaughlin Prize is an internal University of Chicago prize. It honors critical or scholarly essays in English prose in a range of subjects. The prize is named in memory of David Blair McLaughlin, 1895-1914, a University of Chicago student who died tragically in a diving accident. His parents established the prize in 1914; the first competition took place in 1916, and the award was $50.</p><p>Beginning in 1895, a handful of prizes were offered annually for essays in economics, adjudicated by a committee of professors from various universities including the University of Chicago. The prizes were sponsored by three Chicagoans and the competition was open to undergraduates and others throughout the country.</p><p>The Fiske Poetry Prize was established in 1920 by Horace Spencer Fiske, in memory of his father John Billings Fiske. Open to University of Chicago students, it was judged annually by the chair of the English Department, a prominent American poet, and an American literary critic. The prize is no longer offered.</p><p>The Florence James Adams Prize, first awarded in 1912, was for excellence in artistic reading, generally of poetry.</p><p>The Gellhorn Prize in Neurophysiology was established in 1963 by Ernest Gellhorn, a neurophysiologist at the University of Minnesota. It was administered by the University of Chicago's Physiology Department.</p><p>The Olga and Paul Menn Foundation Prize was established in 1949 in accordance with the 1946 will of Olga Menn. Four yearly prizes were offered originally, for short stories, novels, or plays, to University students between the ages of 20 and 26. The first prizes were awarded in 1950. By 1956 musical compositions were also accepted. Currently, one prized is awarded annually, for plays only.</p><p>Another early prize was offered by the New England Free Trade League, for an essay on the topic of trade protectionism. Prizes were offered at five colleges, and awarded in 1899.</p><p>The Political Institutions Prize began in 1918 as the Civil Government Prize, but was renamed in 1944. It was awarded annually to an undergraduate on the basis of an essay on a political topic. It appears that the award later became the Goettler Political Institutions Prize, and that it is no longer awarded.</p><p>The Ronald S. Crane prize in criticism was named for the founder of the Chicago School of Literary Criticism.</p><p>The Sergel Drama Prize is awarded by the University, but open to playwrights of any age, from anywhere in the world. The prize is awarded biennially. It was established in 1934 by the widow of Charles H. Sergel, a publisher and politician with a particular interest in drama. Awards are presented to plays of different specified sorts in different years. Winning plays are produced at the University. Judges of the competition have included Thornton Wilder and Frank O'Hara.</p><p>The Snowday Prize, named for Ronald H. Snowday, is also for criticism.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. Awards and Prizes. Collection, 1898-1980, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>From 1917 to 1919, the University of Chicago was extensively involved in wartime activities. Throughout World War I, the University offered the United States government use of its laboratories and many members of the of the Board of Trustees and the faculty engaged in a variety of war work outside the University.</p><p>Prior to the United State's official declaration of war, a Reserve Officer Training Corp was established and the Committee on Plans and Organization of Military Resources was created to prepare the University for wartime. The Committee was active during the onset of World War I, but as the war progressed, more specialized committees were created to fulfill the needs of the University. In time, ten committees were formed: Intelligence; Military Training; Medical Work and Training; Quartermaster and Ordinance Service Training; Publicity; Relief and Social Work; Woman's War Aid; and Women Student Activities.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

She received a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1963 and was awarded the Alumni Association Public Service Citation in 1981. A founding member of the Hyde Park Historical Society, Block also served on the boards of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Chicago Architecture Foundation and International House.</p><p>Block was a renowned expert on the architecture of the University and its surrounding neighborhood. Her 1978 book, Hyde Park Houses: An Informal History, 1856-1910, describes the neighborhood's sociological and architectural transformation from bucolic suburb to urban neighborhood through photographs and text. Block next turned her attention to the aesthetics of the university itself. In 1983, the University of Chicago published her second book, Writing in The Uses of Gothic: Planning and Building the Campus of the University of Chicago 1892–1932. Block was a lead author and coordinator of The Uses of Gothic, a 1985 exhibit in the Special Collections Research Center. At the time of her death, Mrs. Block was writing a history of apartment houses and their effect on Chicago neighborhoods from 1910 to 1950.</p><p>Block died in 1988 at the age of 76. She was survived by two children and five grandchildren. The sunken viewing garden directly north of the Joseph Regenstein Library was named the Jean F. Block Memorial Garden after her death.</p><citation>From the guide to the Block, Jean F. Papers, 1980's, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>For the first years of the University of Chicago, there was considerable ambiguity as to its colors. In 1892, a committee of trustees recommended orange and grey as the university's colors, but only the color orange was officially adopted. However, this decision was far from final. Not only did the use of orange upset Syracuse University, it clashed with University of Chicago students' tradition of using gold as the university color. Complicating this was the use of many different shades of orange and gold in different combination at student events. At different points during the early 1890s, gold, yellow, Etruscan gold and orange were used as the colors of the University of Chicago.</p><p>Due to the ambiguity and controversy surrounding the color of the University of Chicago, two meetings were held to determine a new color for the University of Chicago. In the first meeting, scarlet was voted by a large margin as the university color, but in a smaller second meeting maroon was selected. Despite controversy over the choice of maroon and the meeting in which maroon was selected, Marion Talbot, chair of the council tasked with recommending the new color to the trustees, recommended the color maroon to the board of trustees and in 1894 maroon became the color of the University of Chicago.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. School Color History. Collection, 1894-1911, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>The University of Chicago band started in 1898 as the University of Chicago Military Band. It received the hearty support of President William Rainey Harper, himself a cornet player in the band. The first director was physics professor Glenn Moody Hobbs, and the band's first performance was in concert in Kent Hall on December 16, 1898. The band operated initially under the auspices of the athletics department, and members (all men) were paid a modest amount for their service. They performed in uniforms of maroon sweaters, white shirts with maroon ties, white wool pants, and, in inclement weather, overcoats and sailor caps.</p><p>In 1922 C. D. Greenleaf, university and band alumnus and president of the Conn musical instrument company, donated 100 instruments to the band. This donation included Big Bertha, the 8 ½-foot bass drum that became a sort of band mascot. Photocopies of articles and photographs of Big Bertha remain in the University's General Archival File.</p><p>In the late 1920s efforts picked up to make the band a year-round organization, offering concerts outside of football season. In 1935, administrative and financial oversight and support of the band was transferred from the athletic department to the music department. That same year, accomplished bandleader and music educator Harold Bachman was hired as director. As reflected in some of his correspondence, he was also a consultant to the Educational Music Bureau, a Chicago organization devoted to school music. Despite Bachman's leadership, advocacy, and reputation, the band occasionally had a difficult time justifying its musical bona fides (and therefore its existence) to the department. Bachman's tenure at the university ended in 1942 when he was called to active duty in WWII.</p><p>The history of the band is spotty from WWII onwards. After Bachman's departure, the band program largely died out, re-emerging from time to time as a pep band, performing in the stands at athletic events but not performing field shows. The concert band gave occasional performances as well, before the creation of the University Wind Ensemble.</p><p>Big Bertha was sold to a Texas oilman in 1955, who had her refurbished. She is now in the possession of the University of Texas Longhorn Band.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. Band.

      "description": "WFCR (88.5 MHz) is a non-commercial FM radio station licensed to Amherst, Massachusetts. It serves as the National Public Radio (NPR) member station for Western Massachusetts, including Springfield. The University of Massachusetts Amherst holds the license. \n\nThe first public radio station in western New England, WFCR radio first went on the air on May 6, 1961, transmitting from a 10-watt station located at Springfield Trade High School. Then known as Four College Radio (Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst), WFCR initially operated on a very limited schedule, broadcasting only from noon to midnight, six days per week, and it offered little in the way of locally-produced content. After joining the Eastern Educational Radio Network in 1962, however, WFCR began gradually to expand its scope, increasing its on-air presence to seventeen hours per day within two years and pursuing a more ambitious agenda of covering cultural events in the region. By the late 1960s, WFCR became a major public venue for the myriad musical productions originating in the Pioneer Valley region, as well as for local writers, artists, and the steady stream of visiting lecturers at the Four Colleges.\n\nWith Hampshire College joining the Four Colleges in 1966 -- thus creating Five College Radio -- WFCR hired its first Music Director. UMass assumed the license for the station in 1967, the same year that Congress established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and relocated the studio from Springfield to Hampshire House on the UMass campus. The station's community affairs programming began in earnest shortly thereafter with the appearance of Que Tal Amigos, a Spanish-language program aimed at migrant workers in the Pioneer Valley, and soon included programming tailored to women (the Women's Hour), French Americans, and African Americans, among others.\n\nIn 1997, WFCR began to offer a 24/7 schedule and offers a full line-up of news and talk programming offered to the region through WNNZ at 640AM and 91.7FM, and streamed through internet at nepr.net . The station's mix of classical and jazz music, news, and entertainment reached over 175,000 listeners per week in 2012. -- From the guide to the WFCR Radio Broadcast Collection MS 741., 1954-1987, (Special Collections and University Archives, University of Massachusetts Amherst Libraries)",

He famously wrote about the period that \"the Negro was in vogue\", which was later paraphrased as \"when Harlem was in vogue.\" Growing up in a series of Midwestern towns, Hughes became a prolific writer at an early age. He moved to New York City as a young man, where he made his career. He graduated from high school in Cleveland, Ohio and soon began studies at Columbia University in New York City. Although he dropped out, he gained notice from New York publishers, first in The Crisis magazine, and then from book publishers and became known in the creative community in Harlem. He eventually graduated from Lincoln University. In addition to poetry, Hughes wrote plays, and short stories. He also published several non-fiction works. From 1942 to 1962, as the civil rights movement was gaining traction, he wrote an in-depth weekly column in a leading black newspaper, The Chicago Defender. ",

In 1925 Hughes won first prize in the poetry section of the 1925 Opportunity magazine literary contest, which launched his literary career. His first volume of poetry appeared in 1926. In 1942, he became a columnist for the African American newspaper, the Chicago Defender. Hughes used the rhythms of African American music, specifically jazz and blues in writing his poetry; thus, he was able to experiment with rhythmic free verse. The primary source of his writing was for the theater. His drama titled \"Mulatto\" became the longest running play on Broadway until the introduction of \"A Raisin in the Sun\" in 1958 by Lorraine Hansberry.

He is best known for his film role as the ruthless mob boss Mike Lagana in Fritz Lang's The Big Heat (1953), and is also particularly well-remembered in the English-speaking world for his landmark recordings of the entire King James Version audio Bible, which have been released in numerous editions. He later recorded the entire Revised Standard Version of the Bible. Scourby recorded 422 audiobooks for the blind which he considered his most important work. Alexander Scourby was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 13, 1913, to Constantine Nicholas Scourby, a successful restaurateur, wholesale baker and sometime investor in independent motion-pictures, and Betsy Scourby (née Patsakos), a homemaker, both of whom were immigrants from Greece.

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Alexander Scourby, actor and narrator, was born November 13, 1913.</p><p>His stage career began in 1936, and he appeared in numerous Broadway productions during his career, including HAMLET; HENRY IV, PART I; KING RICHARD II; CRIME AND PUNISHMENT; Sidney Kingsley's DETECTIVE STORY and DARKNESS AT NOON; A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY; SAINT JOAN; TOVARICH; and THE SEA GULL. His career also included radio, film, and television. His film credits include AFFAIR IN TRINIDAD (1952), THE BIG HEAT (1953), THE GLORY BRIGADE (1953), THE SILVER CHALICE (1959), RANSOM (1956), and THE BIG FISHERMAN (1959). He is best known as Polo, the Mexican ranch foreman in GIANT (1956).</p><p>His television credits include NBC's television series Project 20, and other series including Playhouse 90, the Circle Theater, Studio One, and National Geographic. He considered his most important work to be his recordings of talking books for the American Foundation for the Blind and his own company Lectern Records. In 1943 he married the actress Lori Von Eltz, whose professional name is Lori March.</p><p>Alexander Scourby died February 22, 1985.</p><citation>From the description of Papers, film, and sound recordings 1935-1985. (New York Public Library). WorldCat record id: 122485449</citation><p>Although he had a long and varied career as an actor and narrator, Alexander Scourby (1913-1985), considered his most important work to be the performances he gave as a voice actor in the Talking Books recordings he made for the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). Of Greek heritage, Scourby was born in Brooklyn, New York, where his father worked as a restaurateur and commercial baker. In 1931, he graduated from the Brooklyn Manual Training High School. He had developed an interest in writing and performing while in high school, serving as co-editor of the school magazine and yearbook and making his first appearance on stage in a school production of The Meanest Man in the World . Scourby briefly attended the University of West Virginia in Morgantown, West Virginia, but returned to New York in February 1932 to help out with the family business following the death of his father.</p><p>In 1933, Scourby became an apprentice with the Civic Repertory Theatre, run by Eva Le Galliene, where he received a thorough professional training. He made his Broadway debut in 1936 as the Player King in the Leslie Howard production of Hamlet . It was through cast mate, Wesley Addy, that Scourby was introduced to the opportunities offered by the American Foundation for the Blind. Scourby auditioned for the AFB in 1937, and, after playing a few small parts in recordings of plays, he soon found a niche in which he could utilize his impressive speaking voice by reading novels and other works of literature for the Talking Books service. Over the next forty years, he would provide the narration for over 500 books. His best known recording became the full set of the King James version of the Bible (1966).</p><p>Scourby also began working extensively in radio during the 1940s, with recurring roles on several soap operas and regular appearances on the NBC weekly religious program, The Eternal Light . Scourby also did broadcasts in Greek and English for the Office of War Information during the Second World War. In 1943, he married Lori von Eltz, an actress who went by the professional name of Lori March. The two occasionally worked together on theater, film, and television projects. Scourby remained active in summer stock and New York theater throughout the 1940s and early 1950s. Notable productions in which he was featured included Rodney Ackland's adaptation of Crime and Punishment (1947) with Claude Rains, Detective Story (1949), Darkness at Noon (1951), and the Theatre Guild revival of Saint Joan (1951) with Uta Hagen.</p><p>During the 1950s, Scourby began to work more often as an actor in films, frequently playing villains. Among his films were Affair in Trinidad (1952), The Big Heat (1953), Ransom (1956), and Giant (1956). He also worked increasingly in television as both an actor and narrator. His television credits as an actor include Playhouse 90, Circle Theater, and Studio One . As a narrator, he was associated with the NBC television series, Project 20, for many years. Although his work in film and television saw Scourby dividing his time between California and New York, by the 1960s he actively sought employment doing television commercial voice-overs in order to spend more time on the East Coast. In later years, Scourby and his wife maintained a residence in Manhattan and a country home in Newtown, Connecticut.</p><p>In addition to continuing to record Talking Books, both for the AFB and Lectern Records, a company he founded, Scourby also worked steadily as a narrator of documentary, educational, and promotional films during the final two decades of his life. In 1983, he became the host of the public television series, Live from the Met . It was while he was in Boston, taping his segments as the host for a National Public Radio broadcast of Handel's oratorio, Semele, that Scourby unexpectedly took ill and died.</p><citation>From the guide to the Alexander Scourby papers, 1940-1989, (The New York Public Library.

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Boston's first African American television reporter, Sarah-Ann Shaw was born, Sarah-Ann King, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Annie Bell Bomar King and Norris King, Jr. Growing up in Roxbury, Shaw's father, who was active in the Roxbury Democratic Club, took her to lectures at Jordan Hall, the Ford Hall Forum, and Tremont Temple; there, young Shaw met Paul Robeson. Shaw's mother worked along side the selfless Melnea Cass. Shaw attended William P. Boardman Elementary School and Henry Lee Higginson Elementary School, was a Girl Scout, and was active at St. Mark's Social Center. A student at Girls Latin School, Shaw was involved with the NAACP Youth Movement; graduating in 1952, Shaw enrolled at Boston University, but left school in 1955 to get married.</p><p>Increasingly involved in community activities, Shaw worked with St. Mark's Social Center and as a member of the Boston Action Group (BAG). Shaw joined other activists like Otto P. and Muriel S. Snowden in 1957; national Student Movement head, Bill Strickland then asked her to head the Boston Northern Student Movement where she coordinated student led voter education, high school tutoring, and economic housing education with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), BAG, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the Unitarians. In 1968, Shaw became involved with Ray Richardson's<span>Say Brother</span>public affairs show on WBEZ-TV; she would go on to appear on the program more than twenty times. In 1969, Shaw was hired by WBZ-TV 4 as Boston's first African American reporter; she remained a news reporter at WBZ TV 4 for more than thirty years. As a civil rights organizer and human services advocate, Shaw demonstrated a rare ability to unite Boston residents and tackle big picture issues. At WBZ, Shaw anchored another black oriented public affairs program,<span>Mzizi Roots</span>.</p><p>Shaw, who helped define minority affairs programming and news content, received numerous journalistic awards for her work, including an award from the Boston Radio-Television News Directors Association, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Association of Black Journalists in 1998, and the Yankee Quill Award from the New England Society of Newspaper Editors. Shaw also volunteered for Boston Partners in Education; served as a board member of Boston Neighborhood Network; and served as the President for both the Boston Coalition of Black Women, and the League of Women for Community Service.</p><citation>From The HistoryMakers™ biography: https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/A2007.067</citation></biogHist>",

It continues under the direction of trumpeter Scotty Barnhart. Originally including such musicians as Buck Clayton and Lester Young in the line-up, the band in the 1950s and 1960s made use of the work of such arrangers as Neal Hefti and featured musicians such as Thad Jones and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis. Its recordings of this era included collaborations with singers such as Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. ",

Crabbe papers, 1949-1991 and undated (bulk 1970-1979) (University of Maryland Libraries). WorldCat record id: 29883325\n\nJohn C. (Crozier) Crabbe, son of Arthur and Louise A. (Wiley) Crabbe, was born on July 3, 1914 in Pomona, California. He attended Modesto (California) College from 1931 to 1934, and then Fresno (California) State College from 1934 to 1936. He finished his Bachelor of Arts degree in theater from the College of the Pacific in 1937 and a MA in 1940. During college, he participated in vaudeville and burlesque theater, mostly as an electrical technician. Crabbe did his postgraduate work at the University of Iowa in 1938, at New York University in 1940, at Stanford University in 1951, and at Ohio State University. On July 17, 1940, he married Bobbin Gay Peck with whom he had three children: John Crozier, William Charles, and Barbara Gay. During World War II, Crabbe served from 1943 to 1946 in the United States Naval Reserve as a lieutenant stationed in Baltimore.Crabbe's broadcasting career started on a Fresno, California station reading comics from 1934 to 1935. He then began his career in educational broadcasting while he attended the College of the Pacific, Stockton, California. From 1936 to 1937, he taught and produced radio programs for release on commercial stations. After graduation, Crabbe remained at Pacific as Director of Broadcasting from 1937 to 1958 and as KUOP-FM station manager, having helped put the Stockton, California educational radio station on the air in 1949 . This station started as a campus-limited, carrier-current station as part of a laboratory activity. It was student operated except for Crabbe and one chief engineer, and did live productions of music, ballgames, and dramas. Before KUOP started, the College of the Pacific released student class-produced programs through local commercial stations. In addition, he helped organize the first broadcasting curriculum west of the Mississippi in the 1940s.During World War II, while stationed in Baltimore, Crabbe occupied his spare time by lobbying the Federal Communications Commission for FM channels reserved for educational use. The broadcasting industry did not care much about FM, but simply wanted twenty reserved channels. Finally, the FCC granted educational reservations for FM channels in April, 1952.Starting in the 1950s, Crabbe's educational broadcasting career involved simultaneous activities in California, Ohio, and Michigan. The biography will now focus on each geographic location separately, starting with California. From 1950 to 1953, Crabbe participated as a member in the Western Radio Television Conference, joining fellow members Jim Day, Public Service Director of San Francisco and Luke Roberts, Public Service Director, KOIN, Portland, Oregon. The conference was first held in San Francisco, and was later held in cities such as Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Portland. Meanwhile, in 1951, at Stanford University, Crabbe lectured in radio education.In 1953, Crabbe served as executive secretary of the Delta-Sierra Educational Television Corporation, a Stockton community organization focused on establishing a station on Channel 42. At the same time, a Sacramento community organization, the Northern California Educational Television was trying to establish an educational television station on Channel 6. These two groups met regularly between 1952 and 1957, and eventually merged in 1955 to form a non-profit corporation called Central California Educational Television (CCET). Crabbe served as CCET's Executive Secretary from 1955 to 1958. In October of 1957, a representative from the Fund for Adult Education, an agency of the Ford Foundation, met with Crabbe. The two men agreed that CCET would have ninety days from December 15, 1957 to raise $100,000 in cash plus $100,000 in pledges to qualify for a Fund grant of $100,000. Working out of an office provided by the College of the Pacific, Crabbe spoke to about 92 groups ranging from PTAs and luncheon clubs to special interest associations and raised $115,000 in cash and over $100,000 in pledges. With the money raised, Channel 6, KVIE, Stockton was established on July 1, 1958 and started broadcasting in mid-December 1958. From July 1958 to 1969, Crabbe served as KVIE's general manager.In 1961, Crabbe was the manager of Central California ETV, Inc. From 1967 to 1969, Crabbe served as president of the Western Educational Network, was a special consultant in radio education in the schools of central California and was chairman of the Television Advisory Committee of the State of California. From 1967 to July 1968, Crabbe served as vice-president of the Western Radio and Television Association's Western Educational Network, and then succeeded Luke Lamb as president from August 1968 to 1969 when he became chair of communications. Finally, from 1973 to 1974, Crabbe served as consultant to the Joint Committee on Telecommunications of the California Legislature.Crabbe's Ohio activities began shortly before 1950 when he directed the Association for Education by Radio at Columbus Ohio. Then, from 1950 to 1953, Crabbe became the president of the Association for Educational Radio-TV (AERT) in Columbus, Ohio, having been its vice president. AERT was a largely teacher, in-school oriented organization, inspired by the School Broadcast Conference of Chicago as a reaction to the institutional orientation of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) . Meanwhile, from 1951 to 1952, he was an assistant at the Office of Radio-Television Education at Ohio State University. In 1952, Crabbe became an assistant to Keith Tyler at the Institute for Education by Radio and Television at Ohio State University. He also put together the Ohio State Institute for Education by Radio and Television Competitions on April 18 - 20, 1952. The following banquet included \"Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie.\"Crabbe's broadcasting career in Michigan started in 1953 at the National Music Camp at Interlochen. There, from 1953 to 1954, he served as director of radio/television, taping recitals and board concerts on to 104 miles of audio tape and feeding it to WKAR, East Lansing, Michigan. Then, from 1955 to 1956, he was one of the first Program Associates of Educational Television and Radio Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.During the 1960s and 1970s, Crabbe participated in long-range financing, consulting jobs, and was involved on various educational broadcasting committees and boards. In 1961, along with John Schwarzwalder, he served as a regional consultant on a survey on the need for television channels in education under Title VII of National Defense Education Act. At that time, the Federal Communication Commission's number one priority was to properly allocate television spectrum space. From 1962 to 1964, Crabbe served on the Department Committee of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. Then, in 1964, he worked as a consultant in broadcasting for RTV International (East Africa) in New York. In 1969, Crabbe was also a member of the interim management group for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Network Operation. That year, he received the Banner Award from the Theta Sigma Phi National Professional Society for Women in Journalism and Communications for outstanding contributions in the field of communications. Then, from 1969 to 1973, he was a consultant in public broadcasting.He spent his last formal years in educational broadcasting in Colorado. There, from 1976 to 1981, he was the director of telecommunications and general manger of KTSC-TV, University of South Colorado, Pueblo, Colorado, and then its consultant after retirement from 1981 on. Also, he served as Director of the University of Southern Colorado Telecommunications Division in 1981. Other involvement in public broadcasting in that region included serving on the board of directors of the Rocky Mountain Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and on the board of governors of the Pacific Mountain Network. Crabbe also contributed articles to professional publications such as the Journal of the Association of Education by Radio- Television (JAERT) . Crabbe's other business activities included a term as the general manager of Tel-Vue Stockton, Inc. in California in 1972, and as an associate at Arthur Bolton Associates from 1972 to 1973.John C.

      "description": "Walter Rochs Goldschmidt (February 24, 1913 – September 1, 2010) was an American anthropologist. Goldschmidt was of German descent, born in San Antonio, Texas, on February 24, 1913, to Hermann and Gretchen Goldschmidt. He earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Texas at Austin in 1933, followed by a master's degree in 1935. Goldschmidt completed doctoral studies in 1942 at the University of California, Berkeley. Goldschmidt began work at the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, remaining a social science analyst there until 1946, when he joined the University of California, Los Angeles faculty. He served as editor of the journal American Anthropologist from 1956 to 1959, and was founding editor of another journal, Ethos. Between 1969 and 1970, Goldschmidt was president of the American Ethnological Society. He headed the American Anthropological Association in 1976. Goldschmidt was known for his research into the Hupa and Nomlaki indigenous people living in California, as well as the Tlingit and Haida of Alaska. In his later career, Goldschmidt took an interest to the Sebei people in Uganda. He was twice a Fulbright scholar and received the Bronislaw Malinowski Award. Goldschmidt was named an emeritus professor in the 1980s, though he continued academic research and writing well into retirement. ",

His 1932 Ph.D. dissertation was published as a book titled The Negro Family in the United States (1939); it analyzed the historical forces that influenced the development of the African-American family from the time of slavery to the mid-1930s. The book was awarded the 1940 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for the most significant work in the field of race relations. It was among the first sociological works on blacks researched and written by a black person. In 1948 Frazier was elected as the first black president of the American Sociological Association. He published numerous other books and articles on African-American culture and race relations. In 1950 Frazier helped draft the UNESCO statement The Race Question. ",

      "description": "Robert King Merton (born Meyer Robert Schkolnick; 4 July 1910 – 23 February 2003) was an American sociologist who is considered a founding father of modern sociology, and a major contributor to the subfield of criminology. He spent most of his career teaching at Columbia University, where he attained the rank of University Professor. In 1994 he was awarded the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the field and for having founded the sociology of science. [i] Merton developed notable concepts, such as \"unintended consequences\", the \"reference group\", and \"role strain\", but is perhaps best known for the terms \"role model\" and \"self-fulfilling prophecy\". The concept of self-fulfilling prophecy, which is a central element in modern sociological, political, and economic theory, is one type of process through which a belief or expectation affects the outcome of a situation or the way a person or group will behave. More specifically, as Merton defined, \"the self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior, which makes the originally false conception come true\".

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Robert K. Merton was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Temple Univ. in 1931. Merton went on to graduate school at Harvard where he received his Ph.D. in 1936. Merton went on to teach at Columbia Univ. and published numerous books including; Social theory and social structure, and Sociology of science.</p><citation>From the description of Letters-Manuscript, 1930-1952. (Temple University Libraries). WorldCat record id: 122628275</citation><p>Robert K. Merton was one of the most influential 20th-century sociologists. His work shaped the discipline for more than a half century. A prolific writer, editor, teacher, and scholar, Merton examined a broad variety of topics from a sociological perspective while developing concepts and theories aimed at linking particular phenomena to more general social patterns. Well known for identifying and analyzing self-fulfilling prophecies, unanticipated consequences, influentials, and role models, Merton significantly contributed to sociological thought through extensive writings, studies, lectures, and research projects. While most of Merton's career was spent at Columbia University, defining the Sociology Department and the Bureau of Applied Social Research, he was also affiliated with a wide range of professional and scholarly organizations.</p><p>Merton was born Meyer R. Schkolnick on July 4, 1910 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The second of two children, he was the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. From an early age, Merton spent countless hours at the local Carnegie library where he developed broad interests in literature; particularly biographies, science, and history. In his early teens Merton formed an interest in magic and wrote a high school paper on the magician Harry Houdini. In the course of his research, he discovered that performing artists often Americanized their names. Following suit, he chose Robert Merton as his stage name; Robert, derived from the French magician Robert Houdin (whom Harry Houdini took his last name), and Merton, a version of Merlin the wizard. The middle initial stands for King, but was always abbreviated by Merton. Encouraged by his brother-in-law, Charles Hopkins, he became a skilled magician, doing an array of magic tricks as well as sleight of hand.</p><p>Upon graduation from South Philadelphia High School, Robert K. Merton attended Temple University on a scholarship. While at Temple he encountered George E. Simpson, a young sociology instructor, who recruited Merton to be his research assistant. The assistantship, coupled with Simpson's lectures, sealed Merton's interest in the field of sociology.</p><p>Through Simpson, Merton met Pitirim Sorokin, founder of the Sociology Department at Harvard University. After receiving a B.A. from Temple in 1931, Merton attended Harvard, claiming Sorokin's deep interest in European sociology was his only reason for choosing the university at the time. In addition to Sorokin, he also cited Talcott Parsons, E.F. Gay, and George Sarton as strong influences on his development while at Harvard. Merton received his M.A. (1932) and his Ph. D. (1936) from Harvard and went on to become an instructor in the University's Sociology Department until 1939.</p><p>At Harvard University, Merton's experiences steered the course of his sociological pursuits. While serving as research assistant to Sorokin, Merton wrote his first published paper, \"Recent French Sociology\" in 1934, which led him to the work of Emile Durkheim and formed the basis for what would become Merton's \"own mode of structural and functional analysis.\" Merton's interest in science and technology grew as he attended a course taught by economic historian E.F. Gay, worked with Sorokin on a joint paper on \"Arabian Intellectual Development,\" and encountered George Sarton, the father of the then nascent discipline, the history of science. Sarton greatly influenced Merton's scholarly development and their association, which Merton called an \"unruly apprenticeship,\" lasted 25 years.</p><p>Merton's dissertation, on the reciprocal connections between science and society, focused specifically on the role Puritanism took in encouraging the rise of science and showed, counter to ideas prevalent at the time, that religion could stimulate and canalize rather than undermine scientific activity. His dissertation, Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England, published in 1938, is widely viewed as the first work in the sociology of science and continues to stimulate research on the origins of modern science. Merton is considered to be the founder of this branch of sociology.</p><p>In 1939 Merton moved to New Orleans and became Associate Professor in Tulane University's Sociology Department, later becoming the department chair. In 1941 Merton accepted an Assistant Professor position in the Sociology Department at Columbia University, which would serve as his academic home for the next four decades.</p><p>At Columbia, Merton was a member of the Department of Sociology while concurrently serving as the Associate Director of the Bureau of Applied Social Research, a post he held from 1942-1971. From 1963-1974, he was the Giddings Professor of Sociology and from 1974-1979, he was named to a University Professorship. In 1979 he held the titles of both Special Service Professor and University Professor Emeritus. Merton officially retired from teaching in 1984, but maintained active ties with Columbia University. In 1990, Columbia established the R.K. Merton Professorship in the Social Sciences.</p><p>Sociology was a growing discipline during Merton's years at Columbia and much of his work influenced the development of the field. Among his most well-known contributions were his analysis of manifest and latent functions, theories of the middle range, social structure and anomie, bureaucratic structure and personality, the sociology of knowledge, including the varying perspectives of outsiders and insiders, and opportunity structures. He also examined a wide variety of subjects from a sociological perspective, including science, formal organizations, media, friendship, and deviant behavior and its sources. His interest in the sociology of science took a new turn in the late 1950s when he turned to studies of the allocation of recognition for scientific discoveries and the reward system of science, in which competition for priority plays a major role. In the decades which followed, he pursued his work on multiple independent discoveries, and their implications for the development of knowledge, priority, and the Matthew effect.</p><p>Merton's involvement with the Bureau of Applied Social Research spanned nearly 30 years. The Bureau was established a year before Merton arrived at Columbia, with Paul F. Lazarsfeld at the helm. The working relationship that developed between Lazarsfeld and Merton was one of the most significant in Merton's career and one that Merton referred to as an \"improbable collaboration.\" While their interests and methods of inquiry differed, they proved to be complementary. Lazarsfeld was known as a methodologist while Merton was the social theorist. Pinpointing their influence on each other over the course of three decades is difficult. However, one of Merton's best known contributions, the focused group interview (which later was transmuted into \"focus groups\"), was brought about by Lazarsfeld's insistence on developing well- articulated research methodologies.</p><p>At the Bureau, Merton and Lazarsfeld trained scores of students and colleagues in social research, and produced major sociological studies on the media, mass communication, mixed race housing communities, and professions. Merton published several books related to these studies including, Mass Persuasion (1946), Reader in Bureaucracy (1952), The Student- Physician (1957), Patterns in Social Life: Explorations in the Sociology of Housing (1951), and The Focused Interview (1956).</p><p>In this same period, Merton's lectures on sociological theory drew scores of students not only from the sociology department but also from departments of history, anthropology, and economics. Courses included Analysis of Social Structure, History of Theory, and Selected Problems in the Theory of Organizations. In conjunction with his studies at the Bureau, Merton also led seminars on the Professions in Modern Society, the Sociological Study of Medical Schools, and the Social Organization of Housing Communities. His commitment to the sociology of science developed further in a seminar of the same name which Merton co-taught with Harriet Zuckerman. As teacher and dissertation advisor, he influenced generations of leading sociologists. These included James Coleman, Peter Blau, Seymour Martin Lipset, Lewis and Rose Coser, Alvin Gouldner, Alice Kitt Rossi, Raymond Boudon, Gary Runciman, Cynthia Epstein, Stephen Cole, Jonathan Cole, and Harriet Zuckerman.</p><p>All apart from his teaching, Merton was a productive scholar and editor. In addition to serving on various editorial boards for scholarly publications, as varied as Britannica International Encyclopedia and ISIS, he also edited vast numbers of manuscripts by students and colleagues. By Merton's own estimate, he edited 2,000 articles and 250 books. His own writings include over 175 published articles and nearly 30 books, as well as numerous book reviews, forwards, introductions, and compilations.</p><p>Many of the well-known theories and concepts Merton created are reflected in his published articles, including \"The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action\" (1936), \"The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy\" (1948), \"Social Structure and Anomie\" (1938), \"Insiders and Outsiders\" (1972), and \"Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science\" (1957). Merton's notable books include Social Theory and Social Structure (1949; 1957 and 1968 enlarged edition), Contemporary Social Problems (with Robert Nisbet) (1961), and The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations (1973), and The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity (2003).</p><p>A fastidious and tireless scholar, Merton devoted long hours to study and research. He was known to sleep very little, and often noted the early morning hour in his letters. Owing to his meticulous note taking and organization of research materials, he revisited earlier themes and ideas, revised and restructured his writing. He also put many projects aside being dissatisfied with the work he had done and completed them only decades later.

WorldCat record id: 436206178</citation><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Robert K. Merton was one of the most influential sociologists whose work shaped the discipline in the mid-to-late 20th century. A prolific writer, editor, teacher, and scholar, Merton examined a broad variety of topics from a sociological perspective while developing concepts and theories aimed at linking particular phenomena to more general social patterns. Well known for identifying and analyzing self-fulfilling prophecies, unanticipated consequences, influentials, and role models, Merton significantly contributed to sociological thought through extensive writings, studies, lectures, and research projects. While most of Merton's career was spent at Columbia University, defining the Sociology Department and the Bureau of Applied Social Research, he was also affiliated with a wide range of professional and scholarly organizations.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Merton was born Meyer R. Schkolnick on July 4, 1910 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The second of two children, he was the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. From an early age, Merton spent countless hours at the local Carnegie library where he developed broad interests in literature; particularly biographies, science, and history. In his early teens Merton formed an interest in magic and wrote a high school paper on the magician Harry Houdini. In the course of his research, he discovered that performing artists often Americanized their names. Following suit, he chose Robert Merton as his stage name; Robert, derived from the French magician Robert Houdin (whom Harry Houdini took his last name), and Merton, a version of Merlin the wizard. The middle initial stands for King, but was always abbreviated by Merton. Encouraged by his brother-in-law, Charles Hopkins, he became a skilled magician, doing an array of magic tricks as well as sleight of hand.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Upon graduation from South Philadelphia High School, Robert K. Merton attended Temple University on a scholarship. While at Temple he encountered George E. Simpson, a young sociology instructor, who recruited Merton to be his research assistant. The assistantship, coupled with Simpson's lectures, sealed Merton's interest in the field of sociology.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Through Simpson, Merton met Pitirim Sorokin, founder of the Sociology Department at Harvard University. After receiving a B.A. from Temple in 1931, Merton attended Harvard, claiming Sorokin's deep interest in European sociology was his only reason for choosing the university at the time. In addition to Sorokin, he also cited Talcott Parsons, E.F. Gay, and George Sarton as strong influences on his development while at Harvard. Merton received his M.A. (1932) and his Ph.D. (1936) from Harvard and went on to become an instructor in the University's Sociology Department until 1939.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED At Harvard University, Merton's experiences steered the course of his sociological pursuits. While serving as research assistant to Sorokin, Merton wrote his first published paper, \"Recent French Sociology\" in 1934, which led him to the work of Emile Durkheim and formed the basis for what would become Merton's \"own mode of structural and functional analysis.\" Merton's interest in science and technology grew as he attended a course taught by economic historian E.F. Gay, worked with Sorokin on a joint paper on \"Arabian Intellectual Development,\" and encountered George Sarton, the father of the then nascent discipline, the history of science. Sarton greatly influenced Merton's scholarly development and their association, which Merton called an \"unruly apprenticeship,\" lasted 25 years.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Merton's dissertation, on the reciprocal connections between science and society, focused specifically on the role Puritanism took in encouraging the rise of science and showed, counter to ideas prevalent at the time, that religion could stimulate and canalize rather than undermine scientific activity. His dissertation, Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England, published in 1938, is widely viewed as the first work in the sociology of science and continues to stimulate research on the origins of modern science. Merton is considered to be the founder of this branch of sociology.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED In 1939 Merton moved to New Orleans and became Associate Professor in Tulane University's Sociology Department, later becoming the department chair. In 1941 Merton accepted an Assistant Professor position in the Sociology Department at Columbia University, which would serve as his academic home for the next four decades.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED At Columbia, Merton was a member of the Department of Sociology while concurrently serving as the Associate Director of the Bureau of Applied Social Research, a post he held from 1942-1971. From 1963-1974, he was the Giddings Professor of Sociology and from 1974-1979, he was named to a University Professorship. In 1979 he held the titles of both Special Service Professor and University Professor Emeritus. Merton officially retired from teaching in 1984, but maintained active ties with Columbia University. In 1990, Columbia established the R.K. Merton Professorship in the Social Sciences.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Sociology was a growing discipline during Merton's years at Columbia and much of his work influenced the development of the field. Among his most well-known contributions were his analysis of manifest and latent functions, theories of the middle range, social structure and anomie, bureaucratic structure and personality, the sociology of knowledge, including the varying perspectives of outsiders and insiders, and opportunity structures. He also examined a wide variety of subjects from a sociological perspective, including science, formal organizations, media, friendship, and deviant behavior and its sources. His interest in the sociology of science took a new turn in the late 1950s when he turned to studies of the allocation of recognition for scientific discoveries and the reward system of science, in which competition for priority plays a major role. In the decades which followed, he pursued his work on multiple independent discoveries, and their implications for the development of knowledge, priority, and the Matthew effect.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Merton's involvement with the Bureau of Applied Social Research spanned nearly 30 years. The Bureau was established a year before Merton arrived at Columbia, with Paul F. Lazarsfeld at the helm. The working relationship that developed between Lazarsfeld and Merton was one of the most significant in Merton's career and one that Merton referred to as an \"improbable collaboration.\" While their interests and methods of inquiry differed, they proved to be complementary. Lazarsfeld was known as a methodologist while Merton was the social theorist. Pinpointing their influence on each other over the course of three decades is difficult. However, one of Merton's best known contributions, the focused group interview (which later was transmuted into \"focus groups\"), was brought about by Lazarsfeld's insistence on developing well- articulated research methodologies.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED At the Bureau, Merton and Lazarsfeld trained scores of students and colleagues in social research, and produced major sociological studies on the media, mass communication, mixed race housing communities, and professions. Merton published several books related to these studies including, Mass Persuasion (1946), Reader in Bureaucracy (1952), The Student- Physician (1957), Patterns in Social Life: Explorations in the Sociology of Housing (1951), and The Focused Interview (1956).</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED In this same period, Merton's lectures on sociological theory drew scores of students not only from the sociology department but also from departments of history, anthropology, and economics. Courses included Analysis of Social Structure, History of Theory, and Selected Problems in the Theory of Organizations. In conjunction with his studies at the Bureau, Merton also led seminars on the Professions in Modern Society, the Sociological Study of Medical Schools, and the Social Organization of Housing Communities. His commitment to the sociology of science developed further in a seminar of the same name which Merton co-taught with Harriet Zuckerman. As teacher and dissertation advisor, he influenced generations of leading sociologists. These included James Coleman, Peter Blau, Seymour Martin Lipset, Lewis and Rose Coser, Alvin Gouldner, Alice Kitt Rossi, Raymond Boudon, Gary Runciman, Cynthia Epstein, Stephen Cole, Jonathan Cole, and Harriet Zuckerman.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Apart from his teaching, Merton was a productive scholar and editor. In addition to serving on various editorial boards for scholarly publications, as varied as Britannica International Encyclopedia and ISIS, he also edited vast numbers of manuscripts by students and colleagues. By Merton's own estimate, he edited 2,000 articles and 250 books. His own writings include over 175 published articles and nearly 30 books, as well as numerous book reviews, forwards, introductions, and compilations.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Many of the well-known theories and concepts Merton created are reflected in his published articles, including \"The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action\" (1936), \"The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy\" (1948), \"Social Structure and Anomie\" (1938), \"Insiders and Outsiders\" (1972), and \"Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science\" (1957). Merton's notable books include Social Theory and Social Structure (1949; 1957 and 1968 enlarged edition), Contemporary Social Problems (with Robert Nisbet) (1961), and The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations (1973), and The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity (2003).</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED A fastidious and tireless scholar, Merton devoted long hours to study and research. He was known to sleep very little, and often noted the early morning hour in his letters. Owing to his meticulous note taking and organization of research materials, he revisited earlier themes and ideas, revised and restructured his writing. He also put many projects aside being dissatisfied with the work he had done and completed them only decades later. Merton was a lover of language and embarked on projects to analyze words and their origins, from a historical and sociological perspective, the best known being the aphorism \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" Merton's journey to discover the phrases' origins led to the publication of On the Shoulders of Giants: a Shandean Postscript in 1965.

The library has a collection of 5 million items and serves as regional federal documents depository for the state. The library oversees the Talking Book and Braille Service which offers audio and braille library service to Illinois residents with print disabilities or other disabilities. The library maintains the Illinois Center for the Book, the Illinois Digital Archives and the Illinois Veterans History Project. The original state library was located next to the office of Stephen A. Douglas while he was Secretary of State. It moved into the west wing of the State Capitol's third floor in October 1887. The Illinois State Library is currently housed in the purpose-built Gwendolyn Brooks building which was designed by Chicago architectural firm Graham, Anderson, Probst and White. Construction took five years to complete and cost just under 36 million dollars when it was complete in 1990. ",

A unit of the UW-Milwaukee College of Letters and Science, the station transmits from the WITI TV Tower in Shorewood, and is based on the seventh floor of Chase Tower in downtown Milwaukee, moving there from facilities in the nearby Shops of Grand Avenue in mid-January 2010. WUWM airs programming from NPR, Public Radio International, American Public Media, and also airs BBC World Service in the overnight hours, with much of the weekend entertainment programming scheduled purposefully to avoid duplication with Wisconsin Public Radio's WHAD (90.7). WUWM also airs considerable amounts of local programming and also fills airtime with adult album alternative music, including a weekly program hosted by longtime Milwaukee radio personality (and early WUWM staff member) Bob Reitman called It's Alright Ma, It's Only Music.

Bradford was soon to complete his first literary work by the age of nine entitled \"Fishing, What a Boy Thinks,\" for The Churchman in 1919. This was only the beginning of an outstanding career which continues into the year 2000. Not only has he proved himself an accomplished writer, he has also spent more than sixty years piloting, climbing, mapping, and exploring the highest mountains in North America, the Alps, and Mount Everest. Along with Barbara, his wife, they have mapped Mt. McKinley, the Grand Canyon and Mount Everest.</p><p>Washburn earned his pilot's license in 1934. He was also fascinated with radio and became an expert in aeronautical radio navigation. In 1937 he spent a weekend with Amelia Earhart and her husband, George Putnam. Because he was well known to Putnam, skilled as a pilot, a radio operator and had lots of experience in the Lockheed Electra, Washburn was considered for Earhart's round the world flight. However, he backed out because of safety considerations.</p><p>He has served as the Director of Boston's Museum of Science from 1939 until his retirement in 1980. He currently serves as their Honorary Director.</p><citation>From the guide to the Bradford Washburn Collection, 1971-1981., (Cline Library.

The station also operates two low-powered translators – K240DZ at 95.9 FM in Dubuque, Iowa and K289BI at 105.7 in Davenport, Iowa. The station signed on for the first time on August 25, 1980 on 90.1 FM. The Quad Cities had been one of the last areas of Iowa and Illinois without a city-grade signal from an NPR station. Prior to 1980, the only source of NPR programming in the area had been a low-powered translator of Cedar Falls' KUNI, though much of the area got grade B coverage from Iowa City's WSUI. In 1991, it moved to its current frequency, and activated its Dubuque translator in 1996. ",

      "description": "WLIB (1190 AM) is an urban contemporary gospel radio station licensed to New York City. WLIB is owned by Emmis Communications, along with sister stations WBLS (107.5 FM) and WQHT (97.1 FM). The three stations share studios in the Hudson Square neighborhood of lower Manhattan, and WLIB's transmitter is located in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. The station's origins reach back to December 1941, when WCNW went on the air from Brooklyn. Sharing time with WWRL on 1600kHz, WCNW was granted permission to move down the dial to 1190 kHz. WCNW, which broadcast foreign language programs, was purchased by Elias Godofsky, who was the General Manager of the station, in 1942. It was Godofsky who would change the call letters to the present WLIB. The station's target audience was upper middle-class and wealthy New Yorkers, as evidenced by its format of classical music and popular standards which competed with WQXR. The station was purchased by New York Post publisher Dorothy Schiff in 1944 and regularly ran news updates from the Post 's newsroom at various times during the day. ",

Their faith is based on the belief that everyone carries within them the Holy Spirit. The destruction of life is, therefore, a grievous sin. In the early nineteenth century the Doukhobors had established themselves as a separate body of settlers in Southern Russia. Living in relative isolation, Doukhoborism became more than a branch of the Christian faith, it also permeated their culture and economic life. They practiced pacificism and vegetarianism and rejected co-operation with political authority when it conflicted with their beliefs. Because of their way of life, the Doukhobors suffered extensive persecution in czarist Russia. In 1898, with the assistance of Count Lev Tolstoy and the English Society of Friends (Quakers), many Doukhobors were able to emigrate to Canada.</p><citation>From the description of Doukhobor research collection. 1839-1980.

President Frank F. Wesbrook secured the services of J.T. Gerould to select and purchase books for the Library. In 1914 John Ridington was hired to catalogue the Library's collections, and in 1916 was appointed UBC's first University Librarian. During his tenure he saw the collection grow from 700 to 125,000 volumes. Ridington also oversaw the move of the collections in 1925 from Fairview to the new Library at the Point Grey campus. He was succeeded by W. Kaye Lamb (1940-1948), Anne Smith (1948-1949, 1951, acting), Leslie W. Dunlap (1949-1951), Neal Harlow (1951-1961), Samuel Rothstein (1961-1962, acting), Jim Ranz (1962-1963), Basil Stuart-Stubbs (1964-1982), Douglas McInnes (1982-1989), William Watson (1989-1990, acting), Ruth Patrick (1990-1997) and Catherine Quinlan (1998- ). In recent years Assistant University Librarians have also been appointed, with specific areas of responsibility. A north wing was added to the Library building in 1948, and a south wing in 1960. The Library's growth led to the reorganisation of its collections and public services into subject-based divisions in 1960. In addition, a process of decentralization was begun in 1952 with the opening of the Bio-Medical Branch Library at Vancouver General Hospital. A more comprehensive decentralization plan, implemented in the 1960s, created a large and dispersed system which by 1999 consisted of two central libraries (Main Library and the Walter C. Koerner Library), thirteen public service branches and divisions, and eight internal service divisions. A three million dollar donation by industrialist H.R. Macmillan in 1965 significantly enhanced the size of the Library's collection, which by the 1990s had grown to over three million books. The Library continues to provide access to recorded knowledge and information - in the form of books, periodicals, manuscripts, audio-visual materials, and electronic media - to students, faculty, and the surrounding community.</p><citation>From the description of Library fonds. 1908-2004.

Cancer Institute, St. Paul's Hospital, and Shaughnessy Hospital. The creation of BCMC would have involved a massive expansion of the Shaughnessy Hospital, which generated a great deal of public controversy.

Located in Stanford, California, it began as a library founded in 1919 by Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover, before he became President of the United States. The library, known as the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, houses multiple archives related to Hoover, World War I, World War II, and other world-historical events. The institution has been a place of scholarship for individuals who previously held high-profile positions in government, such as George Shultz, Condoleezza Rice, Michael Boskin, Edward Lazear, John B. Taylor, Edwin Meese, and Amy Zegart—all Hoover Institution fellows. In 2007, retired U.S. Army General John P. Abizaid, former commander of the U.S. Central Command, was named the Institution's first annual Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow. Former Secretary of Defense General James Mattis served as a research fellow at Hoover before being appointed by the Trump administration. ",

      "description": "Charles Siepmann (1899–1985) was a British-born media scholar and policy advocate who spent much of his career in the United States where he was a professor at New York University's graduate communication program for over two decades. Siepmann was instrumental in drafting the FCC document \"Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees\", which became known as the \"Blue Book\" for its distinctive colour. Though he was an academic, Siepmann remained an advocate for the democratic potentials of radio and television and was \"overtly political and engaged with media policy interventions\" during his career. His advocacy was met with a \"storm of protest in the [broadcast] industry\" and he was frequently red-baited for his views. Siepmann was born in 1899 in Bristol, England and served in the first World War. After the war he began working for the BBC where he advocated and developed educational programming. In 1937, after twelve years at the BBC, where he had \"fallen foul of power struggles in the upper echelons of BBC management\", Siepmann left for the United States. As part of a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study educational broadcasting in the United States, Siepmann \"visited key educational broadcast stations across the country\". Subsequently, he was offered a job at Harvard University where he worked until 1942, at which point he left to join the US Office for War Information. ",

It was awarded Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1993. IATSE was founded in 1893 when representatives of stagehands working in eleven cities met in New York and pledged to support each other's efforts to establish fair wages and working conditions for their members. IATSE has evolved since then to embrace the development of new entertainment media, craft expansion, technological innovation and geographic growth. ",

The first national meeting of the National Congress of Mothers (as it was first called) was held in Washington D.C. in February, 1897. In 1908 the name was changed to the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations in an effort to recognize the importance of the parent-teacher partnership. In 1924, the name was changed to the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. In 1950, the group's national headquarters was established in Chicago. The initial focus of the group was on mother/teacher cooperation and child welfare issues. However, as the organization grew and diversified, it supported many other causes including sex education, teacher salary increases, mothers' pension laws, safety, homemaking, adult education, nutrition, anti-drug and -tobacco use, race relations, flouridation of water supplies, and polio prevention.</p><citation>From the description of Records, 1896-1965.

Owned by the Public Media Group of Southern California, it is sister to Huntington Beach-licensed primary PBS member KOCE-TV (channel 50). The two stations share studios at The Pointe (on West Alameda Avenue and Bob Hope Drive, between The Burbank Studios and Walt Disney Studios complexes) in Burbank; KCET's transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains (north of Sierra Madre). KCET was the second attempt at establishing an educational station in the Los Angeles area: KTHE, operated by the University of Southern California, had previously broadcast on channel 28, beginning on September 22, 1953. It was the second educational television station in the United States, signing on six months and four days after KUHT in Houston, but ceased broadcasting after only nine months on the air because its primary benefactor, the Hancock Foundation, determined that the station was too much of a financial drain on its resources.

      "description": "WBGO (88.3 FM, \"Jazz 88\") is a public radio station licensed to Newark, New Jersey. Studios and offices are located on Park Place in downtown Newark, and its transmitter is located at 4 Times Square in Manhattan. The station primarily plays jazz music. In addition the station airs public affairs programming, locally produced newscasts, traffic reports from Total Traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours, and NPR-produced newscasts and programming. It is also available as an Internet radio station, with both a live stream and on-demand replay of shows. New Jersey Public Radio simulcasts WBGO on their radio network every morning between 12am and 5am. WBGO also broadcasts in HD Radio. WBGO's first license was granted on January 26, 1947. Originally owned by the Newark Board of Education with studios in Central High School, it was established as the first public radio station in New Jersey when in 1979 the broadcast license was transferred to Newark Public Radio in cooperation with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. WBGO then became affiliated with National Public Radio (NPR) and went to a 24-hour broadcast format in 1980. ",

      "description": "Tacoma School District No. 10, commonly called Tacoma Public Schools, is the main school district for Tacoma, Washington, United States. Composed of 35 elementary schools, 11 middle schools, 10 high schools, and 4 early learning centers. It is the third largest school district in Washington State. Tacoma Public Schools serve more than 30,000 students PK-12 and nearly 5,000 employees, making it one of the largest employers in the greater Tacoma area. In the decades preceding World War I, Tacoma Public Schools, like much of the United States, were largely influenced by a new influx of European immigrants that had been creating challenges among both governmental and religious agencies in devising a plan for best addressing ethnic integration. Many immigrant families, primarily from eastern and southern European descent, were of rural backgrounds and struggled to adapt to a more urban and advanced way of life. In 1913, the National Conference on Immigration and Americanization developed a list of three essential aspects of immigrant assimilation: literacy, health and hygiene, and the learning of democracy. As a result, schools across the nation began introducing new policies and programs that were intended to promote and teach the importance of these three values. ",

In 1939, KMSU began as an educational broadcasting program called the Radio Workshop for communications students at what was then Mankato State Teachers College. Until 1959 radio shows were broadcast using the KYSM facilities. Subsequently, the college purchased their own broadcasting equipment and began a new independent radio station with programming centered on the Mankato, Minnesota area and the university. ",

      "description": "Robert Maynard Hutchins (January 17, 1899 – May 14, 1977) was an American educational philosopher. He was president (1929–1945) and chancellor (1945–1951) of the University of Chicago, and earlier dean of Yale Law School (1927–1929). His first wife was the novelist Maude Hutchins. Although his father and grandfather were both Presbyterian ministers, Hutchins became one of the most influential members of the school of secular perennialism. A graduate of Yale College and the law school of Yale University, Hutchins joined the law faculty and soon was named dean. While dean, he gained notice for Yale's development of the philosophy of Legal Realism. Hutchins was thirty years old when he became Chicago's president in 1929, and implemented wide-ranging and sometimes controversial reforms of the university, including the elimination of varsity football. He supported interdisciplinary programs, including during World War II, establishing the Metallurgical Laboratory. His most far-reaching academic reforms involved the undergraduate College of the University of Chicago, which was retooled into a novel pedagogical system built on Great Books, Socratic dialogue, comprehensive examinations and early entrance to college. Although parts of the Hutchins Plan were abandoned by the University shortly after Hutchins left in 1951, an adapted version of the program survived at Shimer College. ",

Library. Dept. of Special Collections)</citation><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins, (1899-1977) was educated at Oberlin and Yale. A dynamic lecturer and administrator, Hutchins began his career as a professor and administrator at Yale Law School. Following the 1928 resignation of Max Mason, Hutchins was considered as part of a long list of candidates for President. His experience and qualifications were much debated, but Hutchins was finally elected in 1929, at the age of 30.</p><p>Almost immediately, Hutchins began making high-profile media appearances, and gained a national presence as a public intellectual and representative of academic ideals. His visionary and sometimes iconoclastic positions promoted the University as a site of vital, innovative intellectual activity.</p><p>Seeing his role as one of leadership and public relationship, Hutchins had his title changed to \"Chancellor\" in 1945. The title of \"President\" now referred to the university's administrative chief, a post filled by Ernest Cadman Colwell. The title of \"Chancellor\" was changed back to \"President\" in 1961, early in the administration of George W. Beadle.</p><p>Hutchins spearheaded dramatic and often controversial changes to the university's administrative structure. Graduate departments were reformed within divisions of biological sciences, physical sciences, humanities, and social sciences. A critic of undergraduate specialization and vocational study, Hutchins overhauled the bachelor's degree program to focus on liberal education, \"Great Books,\" and general studies. Undergraduate programs within academic departments were consolidated into the College, reporting to a single Dean. Causing the most public controversy was the elimination of varsity football, which Hutchins and his supporters saw as a distraction from the mission of the university.</p><p>Hutchins attracted loyal admirers who supported the University of Chicago through difficult and contentious times, including the Great Depression, World War II, and challenges to academic freedom. While many of his positions were controversial, and some of his reforms were overturned in later years, the ideals of the University of Chicago, as well as its public image, are largely the legacy of the Hutchins administration.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. Office of the President. Hutchins Administration. Records, 1892-1951, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>Walter Paul Paepcke was born on June 29, 1896, in Chicago, Illinois. He was the son of Hermann Paepcke, a Prussian immigrant, and Paula Wagner Paepcke. Walter attended the University School for Boys and the Boy's Latin School where he graduated in 1913. He received a degree in economics and history from Yale University in 1917 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. From 1918 to 1919, Walter served as an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve Forces. During this same time he also attended night classes at the Kent College of Law.</p><p>Walter's father Hermann was the president of the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company, which was described in 1909 as being the largest lumber and box company in the country. In the spring of 1919, after being honorably discharged from the U.S. Naval Reserve Forces, Walter came to work at his father's company as the assistant to the treasurer. He held this position until 1921 when upon his father's death he became president.</p><p>Through the influence of his parents, who were lovers of music and literature. Walter began a lifelong dedication to promoting and preserving the arts. Due in large part to his father, Walter began a relationship with the cultural community of the University of Chicago. It was in this cultural community that Walter became friends with Professor William A. Nitze, chairman of the Department of Romance Languages, and his family. In 1922, Walter married Professor Nitze's daughter, Elizabeth Nitze, and together Walter and Elizabeth began to make considerable contributions to the liberal arts.</p><p>In 1926 Walter assumed dual positions in both the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company and a new company he founded called the Container Corporation of America. This new company had begun as a side line business making paper containers during the economically lean period of World War I. Walter saw the potential of this new enterprise and merged it with businesses he had recently acquired, the Philadelphia Paper Manufacturing Company and the Midwest Box Company. By the late 1940s the Container Corporation of America (CCA) had become the largest domestic producer of paper containers.</p><p>Walter had an unusual vision for his new company. CCA set out to promote the service offered by its products not the product itself. It could be said that every household contained something made by CCA. Walter also felt that design was central to the success of his new enterprise. In the 1930s Walter Paepcke and CCA became innovators that brought the concept of modern design and business together. CCA launched an advertising campaign that established the company as the best known in the industry. It also helped to focus considerable light on the modern art and design world. By 1955 Walter was honored for his vision and named Industrial Advertiser of the Year.</p><p>Beyond his business interests, Walter and Elizabeth were patrons and promoters of the musical, literary, and artistic worlds. Walter Paepcke served as a trustee or as a member of the board of directors for the University of Chicago, Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago Orchestral Association, Cliff Dwellers Club, Great Books Foundation, and the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</p><p>One unique project Walter Paepcke undertook was a festival in honor of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. His friend, Robert Hutchins, chancellor of the University of Chicago, and Professor Guiseppe Borgese came to him in 1947 with the idea of honoring the German philosopher and poet on the 200th anniversary of his birth. Walter had read Goethe's writings since his youth and was very much in favor of helping to create a program to honor Goethe. A short time earlier on a trip to Colorado, Walter had seen the town of Aspen and its surrounding countryside. After searching unsuccessfully for a location near Chicago for the celebration, the group decided that the festival could be held in Aspen, Colorado. With considerable involvement on Walter's part, especially financially, the festival took place in June 1949. As a result of the work Walter did to help organize the Goethe Bicentennial Festival, he began purchasing property in and around Aspen for future development.</p><p>The development of Aspen, Colorado led to Walter Paepcke's most ambitious undertaking. Spurred by the success of the Goethe Festival, Walter established the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in 1950. The Aspen Institute, a non-profit institute, was to be an intellectual and cultural center of continuing education. Part of its programs were geared towards giving executives the opportunity to understand their role in society and to develop goals and convictions for their lives.</p><p>It was said that Walter Paepcke sold big business on its responsibilities as a purveyor of culture. He devoted a lifetime to the patronage of the arts while building and leading a company that became the nation's largest producer of paperboard containers. Paepcke died in Chicago on April 13, 1960.</p><citation>From the guide to the Paepcke, Walter P. Papers, 1912-1961, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins (1899-1977) was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of William James Hutchins, a professor of theology who ultimately became President of Berea College (Kentucky). Hutchins enrolled at Oberlin (where his father taught) in 1915 but discontinued his undergraduate studies in 1917 to serve with the Ambulance Corps of the U. S. Army. For his conduct, he was decorated by the Italian government. He resumed his education at Yale in 1919, graduating in 1921.</p><p>He graduated from the Yale Law School in 1925 while also serving as Secretary of the University since 1923. He joined the faculty of the Law School in 1925, becoming a full professor in 1927. He became Acting Dean (1927) and then Dean of the Law School in 1928. While at Yale, he was instrumental in creating the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary center for the legal, medical, and sociological study of contemporary social problems.</p><p>Hutchins' youth made his appointment as President of the University of Chicago something of a surprise, but according to Harold Swift, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, the search committee was concerned to find an individual with the personality and the intellectual drive to fill the position. Hutchins' gregarious nature and his commitment to curriculum reform, evident at Yale, seemed to make him an ideal candidate to provide the kind of leadership and vision that the University had not had since William Rainey Harper.</p><p>The initial years of Hutchins' administration were dramatic ones. He accepted and implemented plans for a general reorganization of the University that had been in the works since the administration of Ernest D. Burton (1923-25). These reforms were intended to simplify the administrative structure of the University, to promote interdisciplinary work among the faculty, and to redefine the undergraduate curriculum. The so-called \"New Plan\" or \"Chicago Plan\" created four graduate divisions-Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Biological Sciences – and established a consolidated College as a separate division of the University. Hutchins' major interest, however, was in the nature and goals of undergraduate education in general and the College in particular. Curricular reforms, with which his name has become more or less synonymous, emphasized the role of the College in providing general education grounded in philosophy and philosophical analysis. Impatient with the increasingly fine division of academic labor and the intensification of research specialization, Hutchins became an outspoken advocate of the value of general education. He lectured tirelessly on the meaning of college and seemed to relish his self-assumed role as a leading American educator.</p><p>Hutchins' candor and glibness, his self-confidence and (to some) his dogmatism were mixed blessings. The Walgreen investigations (1935) into possible subversive activities on the part of certain faculty at the University put Hutchins in the public eye as an eloquent defender of academic freedom against the claims of naive xenophobes. On the other hand, his style and opinions antagonized parts of the faculty who came to resent what they interpreted as arrogance and a sort of \"party line\" within the University. Their fears of Hutchins' power and their perception of the declining role of faculty governance at the University, stood behind the Senate Memorial (1944) to the Board of Trustees. Protesting some of Hutchins' assertions about the role of the University in contemporary society, the Memorial coincided with widespread administrative reforms designed at least in part to more clearly define the respective roles of the President and the University Senate in the making of educational policy.</p><p>As a public figure, Hutchins championed a variety of issues and causes. Although he opposed America's entry into World War II, he cooperated with the government in the establishment of the Metallurgical Laboratory (1942) on campus as part of the Manhattan Project. Following the war, Hutchins was in the forefront of groups seeking to control the destructive potential of nuclear energy and to evaluate the broader implications of scientific research. He was sympathetic to the idea of a single world order (which he could trace to Thomas Aquinas) and in 1945 established, at the request of G. A. Borgese and Richard McKeon, the Committee to Frame a World Constitution. One year earlier he had been appointed chairman of the Commission on the Freedom of the Press. Funded by grants from Time, Inc. and the Encyclopedia Britanica (of which Hutchins had been a director since 1943), the Commission inquired into the nature, function, duties, and responsibilities of the press in America. It was particularly sensitive to the constraints on a free press in the contemporary world.</p><p>Controversial and opinionated, Hutchins served as President (and then as Chancellor) of the University longer than any other individual. He retired in 1951 to assume the Directorship of the Ford Foundation.</p><citation>From the guide to the Hutchins, Robert M., and Associates.

      "description": "WQED, virtual channel 13 (VHF digital channel 4), is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station licensed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Owned by WQED Multimedia, it is sister to public radio station WQED-FM (89.3). The two outlets share studios on Fifth Avenue and transmitter facilities near the University of Pittsburgh campus, both in Pittsburgh's Oakland section. On cable, WQED is carried on Comcast Xfinity channel 9 (channel 12 in Bethel Park and channel 14 in Monroeville), and Verizon FiOS channel 13. Established on April 1, 1954, WQED was the first community-sponsored television station in the U.S. and the country's fifth public television station. It was the first station to telecast classes to elementary school classrooms when Pittsburgh launched its Metropolitan School Service in 1955. The station has been the flagship for the shows Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Once Upon A Classic, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? (a co-production with Boston's WGBH-TV; filmed in New York City), and Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood (whose live-action scenes were filmed in Pittsburgh). ",

      "description": "The Ohio State University, commonly Ohio State or OSU, is a public land-grant research university in Columbus, Ohio. The flagship of the University System of Ohio, it is considered a Public Ivy, and has been ranked by major institutional rankings as among the best public universities in the United States. Founded in 1870 as the state's land-grant university and the ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862, Ohio State was originally known as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College and focused on various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but it developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of then-Governor and later U.S. president Rutherford B. Hayes, and in 1878 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to \"the Ohio State University\" and broadening the scope of the university. Admission standards greatly tightened and became more selective throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Ohio State's political science department and faculty have greatly contributed to the construction and development of the constructivist and realist schools of international relations; a 2004 LSE study ranked the program as 1st among a public institution and 4th overall in the world. A member of the Association of American Universities, Ohio State is a leading producer of Fulbright Scholars, and is the only school in North America that offers an ABET-accredited undergraduate degree in welding engineering. The university's endowment of $5.29 billion in 2020 is among the largest in the world. Past and present alumni and faculty include 5 Nobel Prize laureates, 9 Rhodes Scholars, 7 Churchill Scholars, 1 Fields Medalist, 7 Pulitzer Prize winners, 64 Goldwater scholars, 6 U.S. Senators, 15 U.S. Representatives, and 104 Olympic medalists. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". As of 2021, Ohio State has the most number of students in the United States who are in the 95th percentile or above on standardized testing of any public university. ",

He moved to England in 1897 and came to America 1903. He married in Boston in 1904 and had three children, Mae, Oscar, and Martin. Topaz established \"The Optometric Weekly\" in 1910 and founded The Professional Press, Inc. in 1919. He was the publisher of numerous books in the field of visual optics and a close friend of Charles Sheard, author, researcher and educator for whom Ohio State's Sheard Foundation for Research in Vision is named. Topaz died in Chicago, Illinois on July 23, 1942.</p><p>The Lionel Topaz Memorial Library of Visual Science was dedicated October 31, 1955. The library was located in the Optometry Building on W. Tenth Ave., behind Hamilton Hall. The building was partly financed through a development fund started by Lionel's children, who sought to erect a memorial to their father. The fund also received contributions by the optometrists of the state and nation on a campaign which raised $106,000 toward the library's cost.</p><p>In 1987, due to cost increases and difficulty in maintaining a current optometry collection, the Lionel Topaz Memorial Library of Visual Science merged with the Health Sciences Library. Although several reference books were left in Fry Hall at the request of faculty to maintain a reading room collection, approximately 4,000 volumes were moved to the Health Sciences Library. This collection of unique optometry books was added to the Coleman Alcove, the rare book collection of the Health Sciences Library housed in the Medical Heritage Center. Donated by Dr. Richard Hall and Dr. Charles Sheard, these materials were given to the Optometry Department to exemplify the developments in the field of optometry.</p><p>At the time of its closing, the Topaz Library was the oldest departmental library at Ohio State and the largest, most complete optometry library in the world.</p><citation>From the guide to the Lionel Topaz Memorial Library of Visual Science Collection, 1933-1989, (Medical Heritage Center)</citation><p>The Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at The Ohio State University Medical Center is a collaborative center for patient care, teaching and research.</p><p>The Ohio State University Division of Cardiovascular Medicine is a national and local leader in heart research, prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

Until 2005, it was known as the Indiana University School of Music. It has more than 1,500 students, approximately half of whom are undergraduates, with the second largest enrollment of all music schools accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music.[n 1] In 1907, Charles Campbell arranged for a recital of the Schellschmidt Quartet of Indianapolis, the proceeds of which established a music fund, \"to lead ultimately to the equipment of a school of music in the university.\" In 1909, he offered a series of noncredit lectures on the history of music, which eventually led to a full-fledged music department. In 1919 Barzille Winfred Merrill took the position of department head and worked to create a separate school of music. He campaigned for a new music building as well, which was dedicated in 1937, and renamed Merril Hall in 1989. In 1921 the Department of Music officially became the School of Music. Merrill's daughter, violinist Winifred Merrill Warren, was an artist-in-residence at the school from 1927 to 1938, and on the school's faculty from 1938 to 1961. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Born on January 10, 1910 in Lyon, the French conductor and composer, Jean Martinon entered the Lyon and Paris conservatoires to study the violin. At Lyon, his teacher was Maurice Foundray and at the Paris Conservatory, he studied violin technique with Jules Boucherit. While at the Paris conservatory, Martinon took composition with Albert Roussel and Vincent d'Indy. After completing the composition courses, he studied conducting with Charles Munch and Désormière. He graduated from the Paris Conservatory in 1928, winning a premier prix.</p><p>Martinon's familiarity with conducting started in France, followed by various appointments in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. In 1946, he embarked on a conducting career directing the Concerts du Conservatoire in Paris and the Bordeaux Symphony. The successful debut with the LPO led to his appointment as associate conductor of the orchestra in 1947. From 1947-1950 Martinon directed the Radio Eireann orchestra, Dublin and in 1951, he returned to Paris to conduct the Concerts Lamoureux until 1957. From 1957-1959, Martinon conducted the Israel Philharmonic. His appointment as the next conductor of the Düsseldorf Symphony occurred in 1959. Martinon was in Düsseldorf until 1963 when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra selected him as their music director, a position he held until 1968. During that same year, he returned to France to direct the French National Radio Orchestra and served as the principal conductor of the Hague Residentie–Orkest from 1974 until shortly before his death in 1976.</p><p>Martinon's extensive experience as a composer led to his approach to conducting. The Symphoniette pour orchestre á cordes, piano, harpe et timbales, op. 16, from 1935, is one of three first attempts at composition. After enlisting in the war, Martinon's imprisonment in a German camp, Stalag IX A, resulted in several new compositions, Psaume 136, le Chant des Captifs, Musique d'Exil, Sonatina No.3, Sonatina No. 4 for wind instruments, and various choral works. In 1946, the city of Paris awarded a prize to his composition le Chant des Captifs. After the war, other notable compositions include Symphonie no. 3 (Irlandaise), the Concerto no. 2 pour violin et orchestre, op. 5, dedicated to Szeryng, and the Concerto pour cello et orchestre, op. 52, composed for Pierre Fournier. For the stage Martinon composed two works, the ballet Ambohimanga ou la Cité Bleue and in 1949 the opera Hécube with a libretto by Serge Moreux. Symphony no.4 Altitudes was the outcome of a commission from the Chicago Symphony to commemorate its 75th anniversary.</p><p>Martinon had recently taken on a position at the Paris Conservatory to teach conducting when he died from a serious illness on March 1, 1976.</p><citation>From the guide to the Jean Martinon papers, 1923-1994, (Music Library)</citation></biogHist>",

The station is owned by Griffin Communications, as part of a duopoly with Muskogee-licensed CW affiliate KQCW-DT (channel 19); it is also sister to radio stations KFAQ (1170 AM), KBEZ (92.9 FM), KVOO-FM (98.5), KXBL (99.5 FM) and KHTT (106.9 FM). All of the outlets share studios at the Griffin Communications Media Center on North Boston Avenue and East Cameron Street in the downtown neighborhood's Tulsa Arts District; KOTV's transmitter is located on South 273rd East Avenue (just north of the Muskogee Turnpike) in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. On cable, the station is available on Cox Communications channel 6 in both standard and high definition. On March 24, 1948, the Cameron Television Corporation (originally doing business as George E. Cameron Inc.) submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit to build and license to operate a broadcast television station in Tulsa that would transmit on VHF channel 6. The company was owned by George E. Cameron Jr., a Texas-born independent oil producer, broadcasting executive Maria Helen Alvarez and John B. Hill, a salesman for a Tulsa oil field supplier (both Hill, who would serve as KOTV's original sales manager, and Alvarez owned 15% stakes in the company). ",

The heart of the new KQED is a 238-seat multipurpose event center called The Commons. The venue will the host KQED Live, a new series of lectures, concerts, discussions and other live events with entertainers, journalists, politicians, musicians, authors, chefs and others. KQED was organized and created by veteran broadcast journalists James Day and Jonathan Rice on June 1, 1953, and first went on air April 5, 1954. It was the sixth public broadcasting station in the United States, debuting shortly after WQED in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The station's call letters, Q.E.D., are taken from the Latin phrase, quod erat demonstrandum, commonly used in mathematics. KQED-FM was founded by James Day in 1969 as the radio arm of KQED Television. ",

His humorous approach to social issues won him a wide readership, and helped him to operate a pro-civil rights publication in the American South.

WVWC is owned and operated by West Virginia Wesleyan College. The first iteration of WVWC was a 14,000 watt public radio station founded in 1968. In 1975, West Virginia Wesleyan College agreed to sell the station to the new West Virginia Public Radio Network, and its call sign was changed to WVPW. In 1999, WVWC went to a 24-hour format for the first time in the station's history. The station used voice tracking and an automated system to stay on the air. Summer 2000 was the first summer that C92 was on the air over the summer break, run with a skeleton crew. Over this time the station was managed by Damian Little, a student at WVWC who made C92 sound very commercial, with produced bumpers, IDs and jingles. The live internet stream was added in 1999. ",

Borders' influence in the black community was the trigger for a local radio station to offer him a weekly program in 1940. Listeners of both races tuned in to hear information about segregation, disfranchisement, patriotism (this was during World War II), and black migration to the north. The program became the second-highest-rated broadcast in Atlanta. ",

It is a production of BYU Radio. It transmits at an effective radiated power of 32 kW. Its transmitting tower is located on a peak of the Oquirrh Mountains northwest of the university campus, and southwest of Salt Lake City. The station previously broadcast at a frequency of 88.9 MHz (during which time its nickname was Classical 88). The frequency was shifted in 1988 by directive of the FCC, to alleviate interference for nearby frequencies used for aerial navigation, and to allow for a new full-power station to be built on 99.5 in the Salt Lake market. Classical 89 also has the following translators: 89.5 FM K208BZ Spanish Fork, 106.9 FM K295BW Nephi, 96.1 FM K241BV Milford, 100.3 FM K262BM Cedar City, 100.7 FM K264BM Ivins. ",

It was initially a patent trust owned by General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, AT&T Corporation and United Fruit Company. In 1932, RCA became an independent company after the partners were required to divest their ownership as part of the settlement of a government antitrust suit. An innovative and progressive company, RCA was the dominant electronics and communications firm in the United States for over five decades. RCA was at the forefront of the mushrooming radio industry in the early 1920s, as a major manufacturer of radio receivers, and the exclusive manufacturer of the first superheterodyne sets. RCA also created the first nationwide American radio network, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). The company was also a pioneer in the introduction and development of television, both black and white and especially, color television. During this period, RCA was closely identified with the leadership of David Sarnoff. He was general manager at the company's founding, became president in 1930, and remained active, as chairman of the board, until the end of 1969. ",

      "description": "WDSU, virtual channel 6 (UHF digital channel 19), is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications. WDSU's studios are located on Howard Avenue in the city's Central Business District, and its transmitter is located on East Josephine Street in Chalmette. On cable, the station is available on Cox Communications channel 7 in both standard and high definition (cable channel 6 is occupied by a local access channel). The station first signed on the air on December 18, 1948. It was the first television station to sign on in the state of Louisiana, the first in the city of New Orleans, the first on the Gulf Coast, the first in the Deep South, and the 49th in the nation. It was founded by New Orleans businessman Edgar B. Stern, Jr., owner of WDSU radio (1280 AM, now WODT; and 93.3 FM, now WQUE-FM). Stern had inherited the construction permit to build the television station a few months earlier when he bought the WDSU radio stations for $750,000. The station has been a primary NBC affiliate since it signed on, owing to WDSU radio's longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network; however, it initially also carried programming from the three other major broadcast networks at the time: CBS, ABC, and the DuMont Television Network. It lost DuMont programming when that network ceased operations in August 1956. Even after WJMR-TV (channel 61, now Fox affiliate WVUE on channel 8) signed on in November 1953 as a primary CBS and secondary ABC affiliate, WDSU continued to \"cherry-pick\" a few of the higher-rated programs carried by those two networks until September 1957, when WWL-TV (channel 4) signed on as a full-time CBS affiliate. At that time, WJMR became a full-time ABC affiliate, leaving WDSU exclusively with NBC. ",

Johns Hopkins is considered the first research university in the United States. Hopkin's $7 million bequest to establish the university was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States up to that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as Johns Hopkins' first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. In 1900, Johns Hopkins became a founding member of the American Association of Universities. The university has since led all U.S. universities in annual research expenditures. ",

      "description": "Harley Orrin Staggers Sr. (August 3, 1907 – August 20, 1991) was an American politician who served 16 terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1949 to 1981, representing West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District as a Democrat. From 1966 until his retirement in 1981, Congressman Staggers chaired the powerful House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (today the Committee on Commerce and Energy). A longtime supporter of the American railroad industry and its workers, Congressman Staggers' landmark legislative achievement was the Staggers Rail Act, passed in 1980. Staggers was born on August 3, 1907 in Keyser, Mineral County, West Virginia, and graduated from Emory and Henry College in 1931 and did graduate work at Duke University. ",

German-American psychologist Kurt Zadek Lewin worked there and Robert Richardson Sears directed the station for much of the 1940s. Many other eminent psychologists, physiologists, and researchers were associated with the station and its work. In 1963 the station was renamed the Institute of Child Behavior and Development due to negative association amongst the public with the phrase \"Child Welfare\". In 1974 the Institute was closed as a research establishment. ",

      "description": "Carl Thomas Rowan (August 11, 1925 – September 23, 2000) was a prominent American journalist, author and government official who published columns syndicated across the U.S. and was at one point the highest ranking African American in the United States government. Carl Rowan was born in Ravenscroft, Tennessee, the son of Johnnie, a cook and cleaner, and Thomas Rowan, who stacked lumber. He was raised in McMinnville, Tennessee during the Great Depression. Rowan was determined to get a good education. He graduated from Bernard High School in 1942 as class president and valedictorian. After graduating high school, Rowan worked cleaning porches at a tuberculosis hospital in order to attend Tennessee State College in Nashville. He studied at Tennessee State University (1942–43) and Washburn University (1943–44). He was one of the first African Americans to serve as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy. Rowan was also a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He was graduated from Oberlin College (1947) and was awarded a master's degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota (1948). He began his career in journalism writing for the African-American newspapers Minneapolis Spokesman and St. Paul Recorder (now the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder). He went on to be a copywriter for The Minneapolis Tribune (1948–50), and later became a staff writer (1950–61), reporting extensively on the Civil Rights Movement. ",

      "description": "KUOM (770 AM) – branded Radio K – is a daytime-only non-commercial educational college/alternative rock radio station licensed to serve Minneapolis, Minnesota. KUOM covers the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, and extends its reach with two low-power broadcast relay stations and one full-power repeater. Owned by the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the station is operated by both faculty and students. The KUOM studios are located at the Rarig Center on the University of Minnesota campus, while the station transmitter is in Falcon Heights. Besides a standard analog transmission, KUOM is also available online. KUOM's AM signal operates with a non-directional antenna located on the St. Paul/Falcon Heights campus. Due to its 770 kHz frequency located low on the band combined with the region's flat terrain and excellent soil conductivity, the station's AM coverage is comparable to that of a full-power FM station, thus 770 can be heard throughout the Twin Cities area, with grade B coverage in St. Cloud and Mankato. However, the AM is licensed to operate during daylight hours only in order to protect WABC in New York at night. The hours of operation vary from month to month, reflecting local sunrise and sunset times, with the day's sign on and signoff changing from month to month; signoff, for example, ranges from 4:30 p.m. in winter to 9:00 p.m. in summer.

After graduating from Dartmouth College, Class of 1906, Leverone came to Chicago. He held sales and management positions in a variety of businesses before founding the Canteen Corporation (formerly the Automatic Canteen Corporation), which manufactured and serviced automatic vending machines, in 1929. Leverone stepped down from the chairmanship of the Canteen Corporation in 1960 to pursue philanthropic, civic, and religious endeavors. He died in 1969.</p><p>In 1968, Leverone donated $5,000,000 to Northwestern University to fund the construction of a building to house the Graduate School of Business Administration (now the Kellogg Graduate School of Management). According to the University's press release announcing the gift, Leverone made the donation \"not only as a friend of Northwestern but to strengthen private higher education and 'to help perpetuate the free enterprise system as an integral part of the American way of life'\" (August 15, 1968).</p><p>Leverone died on May 29, 1969.

A critical and commercial success, the first three books present three perspectives on a single set of events and characters in Alexandria, Egypt, before and during the Second World War. The fourth book is set six years later. As Durrell explains in his preface to Balthazar, the four novels are an exploration of relativity and the notions of continuum and subject–object relation, with modern love as the theme. The Quartet's first three books offer the same sequence of events through several points of view, allowing individual perspectives of a single set of events. The fourth book shows change over time.

It is owned by the South Korean company LG Electronics. Zenith was previously an American brand of consumer electronics, a manufacturer of radio and television receivers and other consumer electronics, and was headquartered in Glenview, Illinois. After a series of layoffs, the consolidated headquarters moved to Lincolnshire, Illinois. For many years, their famous slogan was \"The quality goes in before the name goes on\" (this slogan was borrowed from the Crown Piano made by Geo. P Bent of Chicago). LG Electronics acquired a controlling share of Zenith in 1995; Zenith became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1999. Zenith was the inventor of subscription television and the modern remote control, and was the first to develop high-definition television (HDTV) in North America. Zenith-branded products were sold in North America, Germany, Thailand (to 1983), Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, India, and Myanmar. ",

      "description": "WHAD (90.7 FM) is a non-commercial radio station licensed to Delafield, Wisconsin and serving the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Part of Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR), it airs WPR's \"Ideas Network\", consisting of news and talk programming. Like the Milwaukee area's other NPR station, WUWM (licensed to Milwaukee proper), the station airs BBC World Service in the overnight hours. WHAD maintains a local news staff and cut-ins outside the main WPR network, and the station's facilities, located on the seventh floor of 310 W. Wisconsin Avenue in Milwaukee (by coincidence, also hosting the studios of commercial sports radio station WAUK), originate some programming for the network, including Kathleen Dunn's afternoon program until her retirement in the summer of 2017. WHAD has its own 414 studio line for Milwaukee callers to call into locally originated programs. Because of the lack of a sister station providing WPR's News and Classical Network to Milwaukee, WHAD provides the HD2 Classical Network via HD Radio to the market via their HD2 subchannel, which only differs from the News and Classical Network in having a full-classical format overlaying NPR and APM news programming exclusive to WUWM in the market; it became the market's only classical music station over the air in 2007 after WFMR abandoned the format commercially. The current-day WHAD is of no relation to the WHAD in Milwaukee which broadcast in the 1920s and early 1930s under the ownership of Marquette University before being merged in 1934 into what is now the current-day station WISN (1130). It signed on in 1948 as the second FM station of Wisconsin Educational Radio, forerunner of WPR. ",

National Public Radio replaced the National Educational Radio Network on February 26, 1970, following Congressional passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. This act was signed into law by 36th President Lyndon B. Johnson, and established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which also created the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) for television in addition to NPR. A CPB organizing committee under John Witherspoon first created a board of directors chaired by Bernard Mayes.\n\nThe board then hired Donald Quayle to be the first president of NPR with 30 employees and 90 charter member local stations, and studios in Washington, D.C.\n\nNPR aired its first broadcast on April 20, 1971, covering United States Senate hearings on the ongoing Vietnam War in Southeast Asia. The afternoon drive-time newscast All Things Considered premiered on May 3, 1971, first hosted by Robert Conley. NPR was primarily a production and distribution organization until 1977, when it merged with the Association of Public Radio Stations. Morning Edition premiered on November 5, 1979, first hosted by Bob Edwards.",

Six years later, he signed with Rounder Records and released his album with Arthur Blythe and Byard Lancaster, Copeland Special . In 1982, during a tour of West Africa, Copeland recorded Bringing It All Back Home, becoming one of the first American blues musicians to record in Africa, and, in 1986, he won a Grammy Award for his album with Albert Collins and Robert Cray, Showdown .

      "description": "Donald Christopher Barber OBE (17 April 1930 – 2 March 2021) was an English jazz musician, best known as a bandleader and trombonist. As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit with \"Petite Fleur\" in 1959, he helped the careers of many musicians. These included the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \"Rock Island Line\", while with Barber's band. He provided an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner, and sponsored African-American blues musicians to visit Britain, making Barber a significant figure in launching the British rhythm and blues and \"beat boom\" of the 1960s. Barber was born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, on 17 April 1930. His father, Donald Barber, was an insurance statistician who a few years later became secretary of the Socialist League, while his mother was a headmistress. His parents were left-leaning, his father having been taught by John Maynard Keynes, while his mother became, in Barber's words, \"the only socialist mayor of Canterbury.\" Barber started learning the violin when he was seven years old. He was educated at Hanley Castle Grammar School, near Malvern, Worcestershire, to the age of 15, and started to develop an interest in jazz. After the end of the war, he attended St Paul's School in London, and began visiting clubs to hear jazz groups. He then spent three years at the Guildhall School of Music, and started playing music with friends he met there, including Alexis Korner. ",

Before World War I was over, these four educators were joined by others and the Emergency Council on Education was created. This fledgling organization, with an annual budget of two thousand dollars, soon shed its wartime nature and changed its name to the American Council on Education. From 1918, ACE has steadily increased in size and stature in American higher education.</p><p>How ACE became one of the pre-eminent institutions in higher education during its history is reflected in its archives. This aggregate of the permanent, noncurrent records documents the various goals, programs and accomplishments of the council between 1918 and 1977. Just as the Council had dropped its transitory name in 1918, to one more appropriate for a permanent organization, an archives of an organization does not include all the records created or received by it during its existence. Most records of an organization are of a temporary nature and, once their current use is over, can be destroyed because the purpose for their existence is satisfied. During the arrangement and description project just concluded, records of a non-current nature were appraised as to their value and either blessed as archives or destroyed. Over half of the records accumulated by the Council were either duplicates, publications, or simply not judged to be of permanent value.</p><p>This descriptive inventory of the ACE Archives provides the membership of the Council, the staff of the Council, and interested researchers, a means to use the almost three hundred linear feet of permanent records constituting the archives. Because of the Council's central role in directing American higher education over the last sixty years, a brief historical sketch of significant events documented in the archives follows. This is by no means intensive or extensive and is meant only to highlight some of the educational issues ACE and its members have faced in the twentieth century.</p><p>World War I not only thrust the United States into a leadership position in world affairs but also brought out the lack of vocational education training and universal military training in the United States. These issues, as well as the exchange of students between American and foreign educational institutions in Europe, occupied the Council. Because the institution was the central coordinating organization of other educational associations and individual members, building a membership and remaining financially sound were vital activities and occupied a great amount of energy of Donald J. Cowling and Samuel P. Capen, the first two directors of the Council. As chief executives of the Council, these two individuals felt it their responsibility for reporting to the membership proposed higher education legislation. Capen, as the second director, established a quarterly publication, the Educational Record in 1920, in order to report to the Council membership pertinent issues and activities. This publication has served a vital need in higher education, and for over fifty years has summarized the activities of the committees and commissions of ACE. From its early history to the present, committees and commissions have been central to the accomplishments of the Council. Because the commissions and committees created and maintained their records separate from the records of the Office of the Director, they are retained in that manner in the ACE Archives. The records of commissions and committees created during the tenure of Cowling were not broken in 1919 when Capen became director and can be located in the office records of the latter.</p><p>The quantity of records created during the tenures of Cowling and Capen is quite small, however that is not unusual when considerations are made for a Council staff of one or two employees. In addition, much of the correspondence of committee members would be maintained among the papers of these university administrators and professors.</p><p>If Cowling and Capen were the copilots in getting the Council off the ground, the third director of the organization was responsible for guiding it through its first decade of growth. Charles Riborg Mann directed the Council between 1922 and 1934. Man reflected his times when he opposed federal funding for higher education. Just as strongly, he promoted the use of standardized testing by use of a standardized psychological test. In 1927 this test was administered to 64,000 freshmen in 188 colleges and universities. Over the next fifty years, the diagnostic value of this examination as an addition to secondary school grades became standard in American education. During his tenure the council began publishing what today is the Handbook of American Colleges and Universities. Not all efforts of the council ended in success. The chair of the committee on Federal Relations reported in 1925 that seven years of efforts to promote the creation of a Federal Department of Education was unsuccessful. The committee reported \"the termination of the 68th Congress and than God.\" In April 1929, President Herbert Hoover established the National Advisory committee on Education and named Mann as chairman. Four other members of the Executive Committee of the council were appointed to this presidential committee. Much of the committee's activities can be followed in the archives of the Council.</p><p>When Director Man resigned in 1934, the former U.S. Commissioner of Education, George F. Zook, was appointed executive. With membership of the Council declining because of the depression, Zook and the Executive Committee reduced Council dues from $100 to $50. Also the Constitution was amended to rename the chief executive the president rather than the director.</p><p>In 1936, the Council announced the formation of the American Youth Commission and elected former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker as chairman. During most of the depression, about four out of ten unemployed workers were American youth. The records of the Commission document noteworthy achievements of the commission in relating to the harsh realities faced by American youth. Such Council publications as Growing Up in the Black Belt and Youth and the Future had a significant impact on how Americans viewed their youth.</p><p>Anticipating wartime needs, the Council began publication of Higher Education and National Defense in 1940. Later, this publication was renamed Higher Education and National Affairs and is prominent today in the literature of higher education. During World War II the Council was frustrated because no overall higher education plan met the approval of the War Department. In various ways the Council and its new Committee of Relationship of Higher Education to the Federal Government cooperated with government agencies. The government request to conserve paper reduced the size of the Educational Record and the amount of records created by the Council. Remembering that many colleges and universities granted blanket credit for military experience in World War I, the council published 50,000 copies of a pamphlet, Sound Educational Credit for Military Experience. At the conclusion of the war, the Council established the Veterans Testing Service, which was later renamed the General Educational Development Testing Service. During its existence the Service tested almost three million adults.</p><p>In 1945 and 1946, Dr. Zook's efforts to promote international education and cultural exchange were successful as he and other educators attended the San Francisco Conference. This influence can be seen in the Charter of the United Nations. Zook was also named program chairman of the United States National Commission for UNESCO and continued to campaign for cultural exchange programs. Also in 1946, Zook was named by President Truman as chairman of the President's Commission on Higher Education. Various committees of the Council examined the need for higher education assistance to those returning from the armed services. A special committee was established to study the problems of the more than 123,000 disabled American veterans enrolled on college campuses. A special Council sampling survey of housing for veterans attending classes was performed.</p><p>Upon Zook's retirement in 1950, the American Council on Education moved to its new headquarters and received its new president, Arthur S. Adams. Because of the Korean Conflict, the manpower question occupied the attention of the Council. A special conference on the role of women in the mobilization of human resources was sponsored in New York City. The Executive Committee again voiced objection to a proposed universal military training program then before Congress.</p><p>Major concerns of higher education during the McCarthy Era were the questions of academic freedom and national security. In 1953, the Educational Record published two articles describing infringements on academic freedom at Rutgers and Harvard. The council held two special conferences on the questions of academic freedom and national security. A new Commission on the Education of Women was launched by the Council in 1953.</p><p>As the Council staff increased in the 1950s, the need for a Council library became evident. In 1956 a small staff library was opened with a contribution of $450.</p><p>Spurred by the Russian launching of Sputnik, the Council published A Proposed Program of Federal Action to Strengthen Higher Education in the Service of the Nation. The Council stressed that the nation should improve and strengthen our educational system rather than imitate the Russian model. The Council's Problems and Policies Committee followed by distributing 130,000 copies of its study, Public Understanding and Support of Higher Education. By the 1960s, the professional staff of the Council had expanded and offered the membership more institutional research capability and expertise.</p><p>In 1961 the new president, Logan Wilson, made substantive changes in the organizational structure of the Council. Wilson' goal was to have a small staff of professionals assigned to major areas of council interest. These council offices or divisions were assisted by advisory committees or commissions representing the wide spectrum of Council membership. Within this organizational framework a large number of leaders of American higher education were involved in Council activities. In addition, a publications department and a department of research and analysis were established in the 1960s as service oriented components of the Council. Although new divisions or operations were created and others expanded or reduced in size, the basic organizational structure introduced by Wilson still stands. From the 1960s, the Council, and higher education in general, has paid greater attention to the federal government's impact on higher education. Today, almost all operating units of the Council are aware of the influence of government in the higher education enterprise.</p><p>Logan Wilson's talents stretched far beyond organizational management. He brought about creation of a Committee of Educational Opportunity which addressed the need for greater opportunities for blacks in higher education. Wilson and other members of the board also directed the Council to look at the urban scene in the 1960s. In that same area, ACE influenced the Higher Education Act of 1965 by urging direct financial assistance for needy and able students. These came to be known as \"opportunity grants.\" In 1969 the ACE annual meeting theme, \"The Campus and Racial Tension,\" was proposed by the staff director of the Office of Research. During this period, the commission on Acadmic Affairs published ACE Special Reports relating to the needs of black America.</p><p>Despite the ferment in the 1960s on American campuses, overseas assistance to newly established African educational institutions was carried out through the Council's Africa Liaison Committee, established in 1959. Most of the committee's early efforts were directed toward sub-Sahara Africa. In 1965 the committee was renamed the Overseas Liaison Committee and expanded its activities into the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean areas. The activities and accomplishments in assisting educational institutions in these areas are fully documented in the records of the committee.</p><p>After a decade of service as president of the Council, Logan Wilson was succeeded in 1972 by Roger W. Heyns. The new president focused on federal legislation affecting higher education and in achieving a better representation of institutional interests on the Board of the Council. Following intensive study, the Board was expanded to include six new members. Also, to cope with the growing demands of relating higher education and the federal government, Stephen K. Bailey was appointed vice president in charge of all Council activities in governmental relations. The Council interaction with government was evidenced by the presentation of 27 oral or written statements to congressional committees or federal agencies during 1973. Thus, under the leadership of Heyns and Bailey, ACE became more the leader and voice for higher education when new legislation was being considered. The Council staff became more conversant with legislative staffs and provided expertise when needed. When Heyns resigned on May 31, 1977, Bailey became acting president for three months until a successor, J. W. Peltason, assumed the chief executive's position.</p><p>It appears that by both the volume and complexity of Council records pertaining to governmental relations, the ACE has assumed the vital role of articulating and promoting the interests of higher education in the legislative arena.</p><p>This historical sketch, although providing some idea of the documentation available in the archives, is no substitute for a careful study of the descriptive guide of the ACE Archives, 1918-1977, provided in the rest of this document.</p><p>George C. Chalou, Archival Consultant, American Council on Education, 1982.</p><citation>From the guide to the American Council on Education Records, 1918-2011, (Hoover Institution Archives)</citation></biogHist>",

      "description": "Michigan Radio is a network of four FM public radio stations (WUOM/Ann Arbor, WFUM/Flint, WVGR/Grand Rapids, and WRSX/Port Huron) in the southern Lower Peninsula of Michigan operated by the University of Michigan through its broadcasting arm, Michigan Public Media. The network is a founding member of National Public Radio and an affiliate of Public Radio International, American Public Media, and BBC World Service. Its main studio is located in Ann Arbor, with satellite studios in Flint and offices in Grand Rapids. It currently airs news and talk, which it has since July 1, 1996. WUOM (91.7 FM) in Ann Arbor is the flagship station of Michigan Radio, broadcasting with a 93,000 watt transmitter from a 237 meters (778 ft) tower near Pinckney. The University of Michigan applied to the FCC on September 11, 1944, for a station at 43.1 FM (part of a band of frequencies used for testing of Frequency Modulation) with a power of 50,000 watts. At the time an assignment on the new FM band was seen as a significant disadvantage. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Radio station of the University of Michigan; formerly University of Michigan Broadcasting Service.</p><citation>From the description of WUOM records, 1914-1982. (University of Michigan). WorldCat record id: 34421429</citation><p>Radio broadcasting at the University of Michigan began in 1923 when students in the Department of Electrical Engineering set up a homemade broadcasting station in the West Engineering Building. On January 14, 1924 a federal license was issued, authorizing the university to operate station WCBC on 1,070 kilocycles, with 200 watts of power for unlimited time. However, the equipment was experimental and proved inefficient for more than periodic transmission. Consequently, the department submitted to the regents a request for $20,000 to build a more professional station, and a yearly appropriation of $3000 to maintain it. However, the regents, believing that the university's broadcasting program could be carried out with less expense through the cooperation of a commercial station which had an established audience, refused the request. As a result, when the station's license expired in June 1925, no application for renewal was filed, and the station's privilege was canceled in October.</p><p>Lack of administrative support for funding did not mean lack of support for radio broadcasting. In the same year that WCBC's license was allowed to lapse, the regents established the University of Michigan Broadcasting Service (UMBS) and appointed Waldo Abbot, then instructor in rhetoric in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, as director of the Broadcasting Service, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1957. During the 1925-26 academic year arrangements were made with Detroit radio station WJR for the regular broadcasting of programs originating on the campus, chiefly talks presented by faculty and musical programs by School of Music students and organizations.</p><p>The first of these \"Michigan Night\" programs featured University President Clarence Cook Little, who, in his remarks set forth the broadcasting mission of the university: \"to give to the former students, alumni and alumnae, a few reminders of the spirit of the campus [and] to give to the citizens of the State entertainment and a brief opportunity to become acquainted with certain of the policies which are shaping the efforts [of the university] to serve the State as wisely and as widely as we can.\" [1]</p><p>In 1933 UMBS became a unit of the Extension Division. Though Abbot continued as director of the Broadcasting Service, he was transferred from the Department of English Language and Literature to the Department of Speech and General Linguistics, in which he instituted courses in radio speech, dramatics, and writing. These were \"hands-on\" courses that provided students with both \"on-air\" and \"behind-the-scenes\" broadcasting experience. The functions of the Broadcasting Service were increased to include class instruction, the recording of speech for students and for faculty research, and the making of recordings to be used by University of Michigan alumni clubs.[2] Radio programming throughout the 1930s and 1940s would consist of music instruction, art and vocational guidance to schools, and a host of adult programs featuring the academic and cultural resources of the university.</p><p>One of the first educational institutions to recognize the potential in FM broadcasting--a technological marvel first demonstrated at the 1939 New York World's Fair--the University of Michigan applied for authorization to build a non-commercial frequency modulation station in 1943. Although the FCC granted the permit in 1944, construction was delayed until after World War II, and it wasn't until July 1, 1948 that station WUOM made its debut. Since 1928 UMBS had operated out of a small studio located in Morris Hall. When Morris Hall was torn down to make room for a new administration building (now the Literature, Science and Arts Building) in 1945, UMBS moved into temporary quarters in Angell Hall, while awaiting construction of a \"state of the art\" facility that was to dominate the fifth floor of the new building.</p><p>When it first went on the air in 1948, WUOM offered a daily broadcast schedule of forty to fifty hours per week, with scheduled programming from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Then, as now, the largest percentage of this programming consisted of music: faculty chamber music recitals, regular rehearsals of the University Choir and the Symphony Orchestra, an \"informal program of music appreciation\" hosted by Wiley Hitchcock, and recorded classical music. But the new station did not abandon its commitment to sharing the university's cultural and academic resources; rather, it also offered a fairly diverse schedule of radio plays performed, and often written, by the Radio Guild and students in the Department of Speech, a children's story program, foreign language programs, and talks by university faculty.</p><p>By 1949, when WUOM finally moved into its new studios, Waldo Abbot could boast that \"at the present [the station is] on the air fifty-five hours a week, devoting fifty percent of its time to transcribed and recorded musical programs. Eleven percent [is] live music presented by faculty, students, and organizations connected with the University's School of Music. Ten percent [is] programs in which students participate, such as dramatic programs, round tables, campus news, etc. Sixteen percent [are] presented by members of the university faculties, either in talks, round tables, interviews, or quiz programs. Six percent is devoted to sports and seven percent to public service programs from off-campus sources.\"[3] That fall, WUOM introduced \"Treasures Off the Shelf,\" an original dramatic series based upon manuscript materials in the university's Clements Library. This series, the first of many such series WUOM would produce over the next twenty years, not only proved popular with listeners, but received a First Award from the Institute for Education by Radio.</p><p>Prior to 1950 the focus of WUOM programming had been on adult education and enrichment. That fall, however, the station inaugurated the Radio Classroom, through which it offered the university's academic and cultural resources to school systems throughout the state of Michigan. The first--and longest running--of the Radio Classroom series was \"Festival of Song,\" a program of music instruction and singing lessons designed to enhance the classroom experience of every child. Though the series was first limited to schools in Washtenaw County, response was so positive that by 1952 Radio Classroom series were being carried, either via direct relay or distributed programming, by sixteen stations state-wide, including the Upper Peninsula. When WUOM celebrated its tenth anniversary on July 5, 1958, President Harlan H. Hatcher enthusiastically cited the station's efforts to \"extend the important educational resources of the University to an ever-increasing audience ranging from pre-school youngsters to senior adult citizens... Through the maintenance of professional standards and the recognition of radio as serious art, educational broadcasters have made an important contribution to modern methods of communication. We are confident that the next decade will see the leadership of educational broadcasting extended, and the service of the University's own WUOM to the people of the State of Michigan enriched and expanded.\"[4]</p><p>The next decade did indeed see an extension of both leadership and service by WUOM, as well as significant changes in how that service was carried out. In 1961 WUOM received FCC permission to construct an FM station in West Michigan, in order to relay WUOM programming to the metropolitan areas of Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, and Muskegon. WVGR began broadcasting on December 2 of that same year. Though WUOM had always been closely affiliated with the National Association of Educational Broadcasting and its affiliate, National Educational Radio, the 1960s saw an increase in staff involvement. Particularly significant is the role played by station manager Edgar Burrows whose tenure as NAEB chairman encompassed the critical Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as well as the controversy concerning copyright law revision, and NAEB's 1967 reorganizational study.</p><p>Though still responsive to its listeners' preferences for classical music programming, and still committed to its long-standing policy of extending the University's academic and cultural resources to the people of the State of Michigan, in 1960 the station began to increase its emphasis on news reporting and analysis, as well as on broadcasting more of the issues-oriented public lectures and panel discussions held on campus. By 1969 WUOM felt that local, national, and international events were requiring them to spend more time \"interpreting the proper role of the University to the general public, explaining and analyzing the nature of internal conflicts in the light of national and international events, and bringing to the University community itself as balanced and detailed a reporting of events on and off campus as possible.\"[5] Consequently, long-time musical program favorites like The Record Collector, Afternoon Musicale, and Music of the Masters increasingly shared the broadcast schedule with protest rallies, teach-ins and sit-ins, and special sessions of the University Senate.</p><p>Subsequent decades have brought even more changes to WUOM--new network affiliation, rapidly changing technologies, budget uncertainties, personnel and leadership turnovers--all of which have, in some way, influenced station operation and programming. Nevertheless the station remains faithful to the mission established in the 1940s by the University Executive Committee on Radio, to \"interpret and report to its audience the various activities of the University with emphasis upon education, research, and training with the intent to develop a broader knowledge, a fuller understanding and deeper appreciation of the humanities, of the sciences, and of social, economic, and civic problems [as well as offering] entertainment consistent with the policies and practices of an institution of higher learning.\"[6]</p><p>___________________________</p><p>1--Radio Programs Given at the University of Michigan During the Year 1925-1926, Printed Materials, box 34, WUOM, Bentley Historical Library (BHL).</p><p>2--\"A Report on Radio Broadcasting at the University of Michigan\", 1943, Annual and miscellaneous reports, 1933-1945, box 32.</p><p>3--\"WUOM of the University of Michigan,\" Collins Radio Company, Cedar Rapids, Iowa [1949?], Printed Materials, box 32.</p><p>4--WUOM Program Schedule, October 1958, Printed Materials, box 32.</p><p>5--University of Michigan Broadcasting Service - Radio WUOM/WVGR Annual Report, 1968-70, Printed Materials, box 32.</p><p>6--University of Michigan Broadcasting Service - Radio Station WUOM [By-laws], Executive Committee on Radio, 1947-1948, box 2.</p><citation>From the guide to the WUOM records, 1914-1982, 1940s-1960s, (Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)</citation></biogHist>",

The flagship of the University of North Carolina system, it is considered to be a Public Ivy, or a public institution which offers an academic experience similar to that of an Ivy League university. After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, making it one of the oldest public universities in the United States.

He attended school at The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After high school, he attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, but did not graduate because he was suspended his senior year for writing an article in the student newspaper critical of the school's administration.

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Ralph McGill, as editor and publisher of the Atlanta Constitution, was a leading voince for racial and ethnic tolerance in the South from the 1940s through the 1960s. As an influential daily columnist, he broke the code of silence on the subject of segregation, chastising a generation of demagogues, timid journalists, and ministers who feared change. When the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in 1954 and southern demagogues led defiance of the court, segregationists vilified McGill as a traitor to his region for urging white southerners to accept the end of segregation. In 1959, at the age of sixty-one, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing.

      "description": "James Thomas Aubrey Jr. (December 14, 1918 – September 3, 1994) was an American television and film executive. As president of the CBS television network from 1959 to 1965, with his \"smell for the blue-collar\", he produced some of television's most enduring series on the air, including Gilligan's Island and The Beverly Hillbillies. Under Aubrey's leadership, CBS dominated American television, leading the other networks NBC and ABC, by nine points and seeing its profits rise from $25 million in 1959 to $49 million in 1964. The New York Times Magazine in 1964 called Aubrey \"a master of programming whose divinations led to successes that are breathtaking\". Aubrey had replaced CBS Television president Louis G. Cowan, who was dismissed after the quiz-show scandals. Aubrey's tough decision-making earned him the nickname \"Smiling Cobra\" during his tenure. ",

The station is part of Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR), and airs WPR's \"Ideas Network\", consisting of news and talk programming. WLBL is the second-oldest station in the Wisconsin Public Radio network. It traces its history to WPAH in Waupaca, which was licensed to the Wisconsin Department of Markets, and began broadcasting on February 5, 1923. The Department later moved its operations to Stevens Point and changed the calls to WLBL in May 1924. In 1932, it began sharing programs with Madison's WHA—the ancestor of today's Wisconsin Public Radio network. Owned for many years by the state Commerce Department, it is now owned by the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board. ",

      "description": "Duke University is a private research university in Durham, North Carolina. Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established The Duke Endowment and the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke. The campus spans over 8,600 acres (3,500 hectares) on three contiguous sub-campuses in Durham, and a marine lab in Beaufort. The West Campus—designed largely by architect Julian Abele, an African American architect who graduated first in his class at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design—incorporates Gothic architecture with the 210-foot (64-meter) Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation, is adjacent to the Medical Center. East Campus, 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) away, home to all first-years, contains Georgian-style architecture. The university administers two concurrent schools in Asia, Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore (established in 2005) and Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, China (established in 2013). ",

      "description": "Peter Hoyt Dominick (July 7, 1915 – March 18, 1981) was an American diplomat, politician and lawyer from Colorado. A member of the Republican Party, he served in the United States Senate from 1963 to 1975. His uncle, Howard Alexander Smith, was a U.S. Senator from New Jersey from 1944 to 1959. Born in Stamford, Connecticut on July 7, 1915, Dominick graduated from St. Mark's School in 1933, from Yale University in 1937 as a member of Scroll and Key, and Yale Law School in 1940. He practiced law in New York City with the law firm Carter, Ledyard and Milburn from 1940 until 1942. Dominick then joined the United States Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet at the outset of American fighting in World War II. He served until his separation from military service in 1945, as a captain. He briefly recommenced his legal practice in New York City in 1946, before moving that same year to Denver, Colorado, where he continued to practice law, eventually becoming a founding partner of the law firm Holland & Hart.

These are heard on WPLN-FM, 90.3 MHz, while some alternative programs were aired on the AM (before 2020, see below). A few features were aired by both at different times. ",

      "description": "The Dixieland Jug Blowers were a popular American musical group of the 1920s. The group was a jug band, incorporating the usual jug, banjo, guitar and fiddle, but it was also considered as a jazz band due to its use of alto saxophone, trombone, piano, and clarinet (played by Johnny Dodds). With this wide variety of instruments, the Dixieland Jug Blowers became the most sophisticated of its time, and influenced other jug bands of the time such as the Memphis Jug Band. The Dixieland Jug Band was created by the commingling of two separate groups run by jug player Earl McDonald, and fiddler Clifford Hayes. They were brought together in 1926 for a Victor Records recording session in Chicago, Illinois, and again in 1927. McDonald had been a musician for almost 30 years, and favored the earlier traditional and minstrel tunes. Hayes, on the other hand, favored a more straight ahead jazz styled approach, eventually dispensing with the jug altogether. ",

      "description": "The University of Alabama (informally known as Alabama, UA, or Bama) is a public research university in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Established in 1820 and opened to students in 1831, the University of Alabama is the oldest and largest of the public universities in Alabama as well as the flagship of the University of Alabama System. The university offers programs of study in 13 academic divisions leading to bachelor's, master's, education specialist, and doctoral degrees. The only publicly supported law school in the state is at UA. Other academic programs unavailable elsewhere in Alabama include doctoral programs in anthropology, communication and information sciences, metallurgical engineering, music, Romance languages, and social work. As one of the first public universities established in the early 19th century southwestern frontier of the United States, the University of Alabama has left a cultural imprint on the state, region and nation over the past two centuries. The school was a center of activity during the American Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. The University of Alabama varsity football program (nicknamed the Crimson Tide), which was inaugurated in 1892, ranks as one of the ten winningest programs in US history. In a 1913 speech then-president George H. Denny extolled the university as the \"capstone of the public school system in the state [of Alabama]\", lending the university its current nickname, The Capstone. In addition, university alumni and faculty include 57 Goldwater Scholars, 15 Rhodes Scholars, 16 Truman Scholars, 36 Hollings Scholars, and 15 Boren Scholars. ",

      "description": "WFSU is the callsign (or variations thereon) for public radio stations operated by Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. \n\nFlorida State entered radio on January 21, 1949, when WFSU started as a student-run radio station at 660 AM. Due to the terms of its license, the signal was limited to the confines of the Florida State campus. It was on the air for three hours every night during the week, with a lineup of campus news, interviews, music and an occasional radio drama.\n\nThe station was forced off the air in April 1953 due to complaints that the signal was leaking off campus. Florida State applied for a low-powered FM license, and WFSU returned to the air at 91.5 FM in July 1954. Soon afterward, it joined the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, allowing it to significantly upgrade its programming with offerings from BBC World Service and Radio France. It also began carrying Seminoles football games because no commercial station in Tallahassee would carry them.\n\nIn 1970, WFSU-FM became a charter member of NPR, and was one of the 90 stations to carry the initial broadcast of All Things Considered. In the 1970s, it shifted to a format of mostly classical music.\n\nThe station continued to grow during the 1980s, but was somewhat hampered by problems with its signal. Unlike most NPR stations of the time, it had no backup power source for its transmitter, resulting in frequent outages. The station's reception was also marginal at best in the northeastern part of the city, which is very hilly. To solve the problem, WFSU won approval for a new station on 88.9 FM, operating from a new tower northeast of Tallahassee. All NPR news and information programming moved there on October 14, 1990. Classical music remained on 91.5, which received new call letters, WFSQ. However, due to the legal structure of the changeover, the Federal Communications Commission considers WFSQ to be the same station as the old WFSU. To improve its coverage on the Georgia side of the market, Florida State started WFSL in 2003.\n\nWFSW signed on in 1996, providing Panama City with a second NPR service, alongside Gulf Coast Community College's WKGC-FM. Until WKGC dropped NPR in 2013, Panama City was one of the smallest cities in the country with separate NPR stations.\n\n",

      "description": "Smith College is a private liberal arts women's college in Northampton, Massachusetts. It was chartered in 1871 by Sophia Smith and opened in 1875. It is the largest member of the historic Seven Sisters colleges, a group of elite women's colleges in the Northeastern United States. Smith is also a member of the Five College Consortium, along with four other nearby institutions in the Pioneer Valley: Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; students of each college are allowed to attend classes at any other member institution. On campus are Smith's Museum of Art and Botanic Garden, the latter designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Smith has 41 academic departments and programs and is structured around an open curriculum, lacking course requirements and scheduled final exams. It is known for its progressive, politically active student body and rigorous academics. Undergraduate admissions is exclusively restricted to women; Smith announced a trans inclusive admissions policy in 2015, however, after criticism from the college community. Smith offers several graduate degrees, all of which accept applicants regardless of gender, and co-administers programs leading to Ph.D.s alongside other Five College members. The college was the first historically women's college to offer an undergraduate engineering degree. Admissions is considered highly selective. It was the first women's college to join the NCAA, and its sports teams are known as the Pioneers. ",

Students from the Archives Concentration and Anderson's class in oral history conducted the interviews with alumnae over Reunion weekend in May 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 in the Alumnae Gymnasium. Interviews were 30 minutes long, on average, and were taped by videographer Kate Geis and Rebecca Rideout, as well as student interviewers. Narrators were asked to reflect on their reasons for choosing Smith, key experiences during their time on campus, significant political and social issues that marked their time at Smith and the impact a Smith education has had on their lives and careers. In 2010, narrators graduated from the classes of 1985-2005. In 2011, narrators were graduates of the classes of 1941-1976. In 2012, narrators were mostly graduates of the classes 1957-1982.

The first women's collegiate basketball game was held at Smith in 1893 after Berenson adapted the game for women. For many years, all freshmen and sophomores were required to take a sport as part of their regular studies. The Smith College Athletic Association prevented intercollegiate competition, maintaining that it would hurt the spirit of friendly intramural competition at the college, but the intramural programs drew much interest, and spots on class teams were highly coveted. The first intercollegiate games were allowed in 1971, and Smith College joined the Northeast Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. In 1981, Smith became the first women's college to join the NCAA, in which it remains a division III member today.</p><citation>From the guide to the Athletics Subject Files RG 80., ca. 1890-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>Since 1900, Christmas at Smith College has involved the sending of cards, the singing of carols, and, of course, the annual Vespers.

Therefore, most of the extant buildings were erected after 1875, though there are quite a few that date from the earlier part of the 19th century and even some from the 18th. The campus is and always has been a mixture of constructed and acquired buildings: Smith' s first three buildings were Dewey House-former home of Northampton judge Charles Augustus Dewey, College Hall-built by the trustees as the first academic and administrative building, and Gateway House-built by the trustees as a home for Smith's first president, L. Clark Seelye (1875-1910). Dewey was home to the very first Smith students and today houses faculty offices and meeting rooms. The present-day campus as a whole serves as an \"architectural garden,\" with styles ranging from Colonial to Greek Revival and Victorian Gothic to neo-Georgian, with a dose of \"modern\" styles added more recently.</p><citation>From the guide to the Buildings Records RG 22., 1875-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The first dramatic productions at Smith were performed by members of societies in the individual student houses on campus. The first of these was formed by Hatfield House in January of 1878 and was named Alpha Society. Washburn and Hubbard Houses soon followed with Olla Podrida in the fall of 1878 and Tertium Quid in 1879, respectively. Houses also occasionally banded together into groups under one name. Sarm Ganok was the name for the Stoddard- Dewey-Hatfield Houses group, and was adapted from the Chinese words for \"Three Houses.\" To these was added Senior Dramatics in 1883 as a feature of Commencement week, although not officially added to the program until 1887. In 1889 the various dramatic societies had achieved official recognition by the administration of the College and in 1891 it became customary for performances to be held in town at the newly-opened Academy of Music. In 1896, owing to the tremendous popularity of Alpha Society, a sister organization was formed, called Phi Kappa Psi, and by 1901 most of the academic departments were also putting on shows. By 1908 the number of productions had out-paced itself to such an extent as to require limitations. The house dramatic groups were dissolved and in their place a divisional system based on class year was instituted. Four new groups were thus formed, each giving one show per year. The groups were called Cap and Bells, Sock and Buskin, The Players and The Mummers. This system was in turn discarded in 1919 when Samuel A. Eliot, of the Department of English Language and Literature, developed the Dramatics Association to replace it and added a course in play production to the Spoken English curriculum. In 1927 even the Senior Dramatics were taken over and all productions were given through the Dramatics Association and the Theatre Workshop, as the performances by Eliot's students were called. That same year also marked the first year of an actor/actress exchange with Amherst College and an end to the tradition of all-female casts in Smith plays. The Department of Theatre was not formed until the 1942-43 academic year, at which time Hallie Flannagan was made its chair. Seven years later, due to flagging student interest and lack of funds, the Dramatics Association voted to merge with the theatre department. All productions thereafter were produced by the department.</p><citation>From the guide to the Dramatics Files RG 80., 1878-1949, (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>Smith College has many traditional special days. One of the earliest special days celebrated at Smith College was Ivy Day.

Francis Ganong was appointed the first director of the botanic garden in 1894, and a systematics garden, based on the theories of Adolf Engler and Karl Prantl was added to the plan under his direction. The master plan has undergone numerous changes, including new systems of walkways and lawns, the expansion of the Lyman Plant House, the construction of a Japanese tea hut and garden, and the reorganization of the herbaceous garden according to more current evolutionary theories.</p><citation>From the guide to the Grounds Subject Files RG 24., 1879-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><citation>From the description of Grounds subject records, 1879-[ongoing].

WorldCat record id: 53372597</citation><p>Smith College had booths at several world fairs and expositions from the 1890s to the 1930s, giving the college unique opportunities to publicize its merits. It was one of the only women's colleges to consistently appear at world fairs. The booths highlighted Smith's history, famous figures, campus, educational opportunities, and distinguished alumnae. The four stated purposes of such displays were to 1) greet and aid alumnae (who had often traveled great distances and were unfamiliar with the area); 2) attract new students; 3) \"make friends\" for the college (leave visitors with favorable impressions); and 4) interest possible donors. The booths were staffed by alumnae and local Smith College Clubs played major roles in planning the events.</p><p>The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago was the first time women had taken an active role in planning the fair. The Smith College booth was in the Women's Building, which brought together many booths related to women's interests and was called \"one of the first major expressions of feminist consciousness\" in the country.</p><p>At the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, Smith's booth was in the Palace of Education. This time, the catchphrase was \"bringing Smith to California\" as the college tried to recruit West Coast students. The college took its role as the main representative of higher education for women seriously, and focused on the achievements of college educated women in the world.</p><p>The booth at the 1933 Century of Progress fair in Chicago was located at a highly visible junction in the Hall of Social Sciences. Despite early plans to have a combined Seven Sisters display, in the end Smith was the only women's college to have a booth. However, there was a lounge area for alumnae of all women's colleges elsewhere in the same building. The main attraction of the Smith booth that year was the colorful mural background painted by art professor Oliver Larkin, portraying various aspects of student life at Smith.</p><citation>From the guide to the World Fairs Records RG 12., 1893-1939, (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The tradition of dances and recreation at Smith is longstanding. From social gatherings, teas, and parties in the 1880s and 1890s, to the hosting of \"Supper Dance\" Weekend from the 1920s through the 1940s, to the present day traditions of Friday Teas, Winter Weekend, Spring Weekend and Rugby Prom, Smith has seen its fair share of parties.</p><p>While much of the information regarding the gatherings cannot be found in the folders, many of the photographs tell their own stories.</p><p>There is a plethora of information about the Supper Dance. Preceded by 'walk arounds\" in the 1880s, when the Glee Club was founded in 1888, it hosted a yearly spring concert, which gradually evolved into Spring Dance and Supper Dance. Organized by a student committee, the dance was open to the entire college, with each house hosting its own dance and hired bands. Because Smith women are \"unusually smart as well as unusually attractive, and . . . their hospitality is rightly famous\" according to an article for LIFE magazine, the Supper dance was unusually popular and especially well anticipated by male guests. As their hosts, Smithies paid for their weekend and were allowed to cut in on couples and choose their dance partners. The weekend consisted of Friday classes, dancing lasting the greater part of Saturday with a break for dinner, and Sunday activities. The dance was so famous as to attract photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt of LIFE magazine to take pictures for an article about the Supper Dance in 1937. The Supper Dance continued until the 1940s, probably when wartime took its toll.</p><citation>From the guide to the Dances and Recreation Files RG 80., 1881-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The Smith Centennial Study, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, was a project that President Mendenhall asked Jacqueline Van Voris to undertake in 1970 as an oral history project for Smith College's centennial celebration. Ms. Van Voris dedicated over four years to the project, which culminated with the publication of the book, College: A Smith Mosaic, which she submitted as partial fulfillment of requirements for her MA in Education in 1975. The purpose of the study was to provide a source of information about the importance of education in women's lives. Smith alumnae were interviewed, their observations were recorded on tape and the tapes were transcribed. The interviews were informal conversations conducted in a manner designed to extract pertinent information. The questions were designed to stimulate conversation and to keep the focus on the respondent. Phrasing of the questions encouraged the respondent's frank appraisal of her education. Questions typically asked included: \"Why did you decide to go to Smith? Was it your idea? What was your academic preparation? What courses did you study? What are your remembrances of Smith? What is your general assessment of the education you received? How could college have helped you more? Have your views on education changed over the years since your graduation? Have you ever felt discriminated against because you are a woman?\"</p><p>The interviews were conducted and recorded from 1971-74. The book, College: A Smith Mosaic, was published in February, 1975 and lists of respondents were sent to the Directory of Oral History Collections for inclusion in that directory.</p><citation>From the guide to the Smith Centennial Study Oral History Project RG 12., 1970-75, (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The Student Demonstrations files document how Smith College students have expressed their opposition to national and local issues through rallies and protests since 1933. Major events such as the United States' involvement in World War II, presidential elections, and segregation prompted the majority of student demonstrations from the 1930s to 1960s. Issues of the 1980s and 1990s include opposition to the Persian Gulf War, support for Ada Comstock Scholars, as well as rallies to help improve women's safety on college campuses.</p><p>The 1986 occupation of College Hall makes up the largest portion of the Student Demonstration files. These folders contain both primary and secondary sources, documenting Smith students' opposition to the Board of Trustees' investment in South African companies that contributed to apartheid.</p><citation>From the guide to the Student Demonstrations Files RG 80., ca. 1933-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The idea of a nationally coordinated student strike developed over a period of at least two years of growing tension between the federal administration and minority and student groups who expressed dissatisfaction with the undeclared war in Vietnam, the military draft, and economic consequences of the war. Coordinated by the National Moratorium Committee (organized in June 1969), Moratorium Days held on October 15, 1969 and November 15, 1969 included the suspension of classes, neighborhood canvassing, protest marches and petitions. The third week in March 1970 was proclaimed National Anti-Draft Week. Planned demonstrations were held at local draft board offices, and \"we won't go\" petitions were circulated. In 1970, the Fast for Peace was held on April 13, 14, and 15, as an expression of moral concern about the war. In early May, student opposition intensified with the knowledge of the expansion of the conflict into Cambodia, President Nixon's April 3 announcement of his decision to resume bombing in North Vietnam, and the treatment of dissenters in the United States. On May 4, the day of the killings on the Kent State University campus, \"leaders of the National Student Association and the former Vietnam Moratorium Committee officially called for a nationwide strike of indefinite duration\" (Facts on File 1970, p.299).</p><p>At Smith, the Moratorium Days were occasions for student involvement in the local community. Smith students staffed the Green Street Moratorium office, canvassed residents, and coordinated marches down Main Street with the cooperation of local businesses. The first Moratorium Day was October 15, 1969 and was called Work for Peace Day at Smith. Smith's Chaplain the Rev. Richard P. Unsworth participated in a memorial service for Hampshire County veterans held at the Unitarian Church. On the second Moratorium Day, November 15, 1969, a contingent of 250 Smith students and 10 Smith professors attended the march in Washington, D. C to protest the Vietnam War. In Northampton, the weekend of November 15 included a teach-in at Wright Hall, a silent march from Helen Hills Hills Chapel to the center of Northampton and back, and well-attended coffee klatches held in a number of Northampton homes.</p><p>A timeline of activities at Smith during the May, 1970 Strike is provided below. During and after the strike, alumnae and friends of the college became involved. On May 30, President Mendenhall announced that his office was receiving 10 letters a day expressing opinions about the strike (tape recording of last Chapel,../../70). Many seminars were repeated during Commencement Weekend for the benefit of alumnae and parents, and a video tape of many of the strike activities was shown. The following organizations formed at Smith due to the strike: the Strike Committee, the Education Committee, the Community Action Committee, Union for National Draft Opposition, Committee on Justice and Repression at Home, Unofficial Committee of Concerned Citizens, Committee on Governance, and the People's Lobby. The activities of the People's Lobby continued beyond the academic year, with students working in Northampton, in Washington D. C., and in their hometown to spread information and coordinate lobbying efforts. Several existing Smith organizations took part in Strike activities; these include: the Student Government Association, the Committee on Educational Policy, the Faculty - Student Committee, and the Young Republican Club.</p><chronList><chronItem>May 4, 5 p.m.At regularly scheduled all-college meetings, a few students and a professor speak about strike issues, and there is a discussion of race/foreign policy distinction.</chronItem><chronItem>May 4, 8 p.m.About 30 people opposed to the strike gather in front of Neilson Library.

Over time, these celebrations evolved from essentially social dinners or receptions into daylong college events. The addition of a 'rally' to the day in 1894 was eventually reflected in the name Rally Day, first used in 1906. The celebration is now held annually on the third Wednesday in February.</p><p>Through the years, students have sponsored and participated in a range of activities: rallies, debates, basketball rivalries, dramatic presentations, singing and dancing. The current tradition of sponsoring an event to benefit a charity began in 1918 when the Rally Day Show was held to raise funds for the Smith College Relief Unit serving in World War I France.</p><p>The Smith College Medal has been awarded to outstanding alumnae at Rally Day since 1973. The medalists have become an important part of the program, speaking prior to convocation in classes and afterward in conversations with students.</p><p>Dress at Rally Day has evolved as well. In 1944, the senior class began wearing its graduation caps and gowns to the convocation. The day still marks the first time the seniors publicly wear their gowns. In recent years, however, the caps have been replaced by inventive hats of the students' choosing (and sometimes of their own making), in keeping with the 'rallying' and spirited nature of the day.\" (From the Rally Day Convocation Program February 23, 2000)</p><citation>From the guide to the Rally Day Files RG 80., 1885-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>As an institution Smith College has many traditions, some with history since its inception. One of the earliest special days celebrated at Smith College was Ivy Day. Still celebrated, Ivy Day is a day in which departing seniors plant ivy cuts on the Smith grounds, symbolizing their seed of knowledge, in hopes that it will flourish. Today, cuts are taken from vines around campus and given to first-year students in anticipation of their own Ivy Day celebration.</p><p>Many of those traditions include Special Day celebrations for students, staff, faculty, and parents. Included in the Special Days boxes are the Father's Day folders containing programs, POPS! concert programs, photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings. The change from Father's Weekend to Parent's Weekend and then Family Weekend is documented with the information contained in these folders.</p><p>Halloween, Thanksgiving, Easter, Float Night are special days included within the folders. And the repertoire of special days continues to grow as Smith College adds new special day traditions to its old ones: Celebration of Sisterhood and Otelia Cromwell Day. Each celebration seeks to acknowledge and diversify, celebrating what is present and what is to come. Smith College, having a history of celebrating, embracing, renewing and creating traditions, will carry several of them into the future and create several more.</p><citation>From the guide to the Special Days A-Z Files RG 80., 1884-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>\"Published when the spirit moves\", Campus Cat was a publication created by Smith students in 1918. Its contents provided information to the campus about going-ons, events, activities, and poked fun at the rituals, trials, and stresses of academia and life on the Smith campus. It was a popular publication, provoking many other related publications such as Freshman Eti-Cat and the Campus Cat-alogue, among others.</p><p>The Campus Cat was written by a group of students whose sarcasm and wit are clearly evident in each issue of the publication. It was a highly coveted publication and to be included in the group of Campus Cat writers was to hold a position of prestige. The publication ceased in 1929.</p><p>However, in 1949, students brought the Cat back. The Campus Cat was now funded by the college.

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Dean of African American historians, John Hope Franklin was born January 2, 1915 in Rentriesville, Oklahoma. His family relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma shortly after the Tulsa Disaster of 1921. Franklin's mother, Mollie was a teacher and his father, B.C. Franklin was an attorney who handled lawsuits precipitated by the famous Tulsa Race Riot. Graduating from Booker T. Washington High School in 1931, Franklin received an A.B. from Fisk University in 1935 and went on to attend Harvard University, where he received his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in history.</p><p>Franklin began his teaching career at Fisk University before moving on to St. Augustine's College. It was at North Carolina Central University, in 1945, with a $500 advance from Alfred A. Knopf, and help from his wife, Aurelia, that Franklin began writing the classic African American history text, From Slavery to Freedom. The book, co-authored by Alfred A. Moss, Jr. is now in its seventh edition and is published in several different languages. Franklin taught at Howard University for nine years, before becoming the first black to chair the History Department at Brooklyn College in 1956. He was then hired by the University of Chicago in 1964 and chaired the History Department from 1967 to 1970. There, he served as the John Matthews Manly Distinguished Service Professor from 1969 to 1982, when he was made Professor Emeritus. In 1982, Franklin joined the faculty at Duke University as the James B. Duke Professor Emeritus of History.</p><p>Active in professional organizations, Franklin has been president of the Southern Historical Society, the Organization of American Historians and the American Historical Association. He is a life long member of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, where he served on the editorial board of the Journal of Negro History. In 1997, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton as chairman of the advisory board for One America, the President's Initiative on Race. Franklin has written hundreds of articles and at least 15 books. His recent works include Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantations with Loren Schweninger, George Washington Williams: A Biography and a book about his father My Life and an Era: the Autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin as well as his own autobiography, The Vintage Years. In 1978 Who's Who in America selected Franklin as one of eight Americans who have made significant contributions to society. Among his many other awards are the Organization of American Historians Award for Outstanding Achievement and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In June 1997, PBS aired First Person Singular: John Hope Franklin, a film produced by Lives and Legacies Films.</p><p>Still sought after as a lecturer and advisor, Franklin lives in Durham, North Carolina, where he cultivates orchids.</p><p>Franklin was interviewed by The HistoryMakers on November 28, 2003.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Franklin, John Hope.

Two branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area on the Kansas side: the university's medical school and hospital in Kansas City, the Edwards Campus in Overland Park, a hospital and research center in the state's capital of Topeka, and a hospital and research center in Hays. There are also educational and research sites in Garden City, Hays, Leavenworth, Parsons, and Topeka, an agricultural education center in rural north Douglas County, and branches of the medical school in Salina and Wichita. The university is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". Founded March 21, 1865, the university was opened in 1866, under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864 and legislation passed in 1863 under the State Constitution, which was adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union. Disputes over Kansas' establishment as a free or slaveholding state prior to admission to the union prompted an internal civil war known as \"Bleeding Kansas\" during the 1850s. ",

      "description": "Merle Fainsod (May 2, 1907 – February 11, 1972) was an American political scientist best known for his work on public administration and as a scholar of the Soviet Union. His books Smolensk under Soviet Rule, based on documents captured by the German Army during World War II, and How Russia is Ruled (also known as How the Soviet Union is Governed) helped form the basis of American study of the Soviet Union, and established him \"as a leading political scientist of the Soviet Union.\" Fainsod is also remembered for his work in the Office of Price Administration and as the director of the Harvard University Library. Fainsod was born in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania on May 2, 1907, and spent his childhood years there. In 1920, after the death of his father, Fainsod's family moved to St. Louis. Fainsod attended Washington University in St. Louis, graduating in 1928 with a B.A. in political science and an M.A. in 1930. He then began his Ph.D at Harvard University in government, completing it in only 2 years. ",

      "description": "Raymond Charles Moley (September 27, 1886 – February 18, 1975) was an American political economist. Initially a leading supporter of the New Deal, he went on to become its bitter opponent before the end of the Great Depression. The son of Felix James and Agnes Fairchild Moley, he was educated at Baldwin-Wallace College and Oberlin College and received his PhD from Columbia University in 1918. He taught in several schools in Ohio until 1914. In 1916 he was appointed instructor and assistant professor of politics at Western Reserve University and from 1919 was director of the Cleveland Foundation. In 1918–19 he was also director of Americanization work under the Ohio State Council of Defense. He joined the Barnard College faculty in 1923, then became a professor of law at Columbia University from 1928–1954, where he was a specialist on the criminal justice system. ",

It carries programs from NPR and Public Radio International. KFJM shares its coverage area with Minnesota Public Radio outlets KNTN and KQMN, both licensed to Thief River Falls, Minnesota. This makes Grand Forks one of the smallest markets with competing NPR stations. KFJM signed on in 1995 as KFJY on 90.7 MHz. It was the University of North Dakota's third radio station, joining the original KFJM, an AM station dating back to 1923, and KFJM-FM on 89.3 MHz, which had been established in 1976. KFJY simulcast KFJM with an adult album alternative (AAA) format and jazz overnight. During April 1997, both stations went off the air as the floodwaters went through the transmitter site. ",

Between 1917 and 1919 during the First World War, he became a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Following the war, he returned to Yale University where he obtained his Master's (1921) and doctorate (1923) degrees. He won the John Addison Porter prize in 1923 for his dissertation The Public Life of Thomas Cooper, 1783–1839 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1926). ",

The university also includes seven regional campuses in Northeast Ohio and additional facilities in the region and internationally. Regional campuses are located in Ashtabula, Burton, East Liverpool, Jackson Township, New Philadelphia, Salem, and Warren, Ohio, with additional facilities in Cleveland, Independence, and Twinsburg, Ohio, New York City, and Florence, Italy. The university was established in 1910 as a teacher-training school. The first classes were held in 1912 at various locations and in temporary buildings in Kent and the first buildings of the original campus opened the following year. Since then, the university has grown to include many additional baccalaureate and graduate programs of study in the arts and sciences, research opportunities, as well as over 1,000 acres (405 ha) and 119 buildings on the Kent campus. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the university was known internationally for its student activism in opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, due mainly to the Kent State shootings in 1970.

Just over five months after its establishment, the Searchlight was replaced by the Kent Stater on July 29, 1926. The newspaper took on its current title as the Daily Kent Stater in December of 1953. Today, the Daily Kent Stater is published Monday through Friday during the regular school year, and weekly on Wednesdays during the summer months.

      "description": "Michigan State University (MSU) is a public land-grant research university in East Lansing, Michigan. MSU was founded in 1855 and served as a model for land-grant colleges and universities later created under the Morrill Act of 1862. The university was founded as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, one of the country's first institutions of higher education to teach scientific agriculture. After the introduction of the Morrill Act, the college became coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. Today, MSU is one of the largest universities in the United States (in terms of enrollment) and has approximately 634,300 living alumni worldwide. U.S. News & World Report ranks its graduate programs the best in the U.S. in elementary teacher's education, secondary teacher's education, industrial and organizational psychology, rehabilitation counseling, African history (tied), supply chain logistics and nuclear physics in 2019. MSU pioneered the studies of packaging, hospitality business, supply chain management, and communication sciences. Michigan State is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". The university's campus houses the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden, the Abrams Planetarium, the Wharton Center for Performing Arts, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, and the country's largest residence hall system.

The radio station is not-for-profit, and listener-supported. The broadcast is mirrored as streaming media on the World Wide Web, extending the station's audience far beyond the Bay Area. Owned by the San Mateo Community College District, the station serves the San Francisco Bay Area from studios at the College of San Mateo. KCSM radio and KCSM-TV were originally established by the College of San Mateo as training facilities for radio and TV broadcasters. Many well-known media personalities were educated at the College of San Mateo, including tabloid TV reporter Steve Wilson, ESPN sportscaster, San Francisco Giants announcer Jon Miller and K101 air personality Jeff Serr.

The AFM, which has its headquarters in New York City, is led by president Raymond M. Hair, Jr. Founded in Cincinnati in 1896 as the successor to the \"National League of Musicians,\" the AFM is the largest organization in the world to represent professional musicians. They negotiate fair agreements, protect ownership of recorded music, secure benefits such as health care and pension, and lobby legislators. In the US, it is the American Federation of Musicians (AFM)—and in Canada, the Canadian Federation of Musicians/Fédération canadienne des musiciens (CFM/FCM). The AFM is affiliated with AFL–CIO, the largest federation of Unions in the United States; and the Canadian Labour Congress, the federation of unions in Canada. Among the best known AFM actions was the 1942–44 musicians' strike, to pressure record companies to agree to a better arrangement for paying royalties. ",

Owned by not-for-profit broadcasting entity Window to the World Communications, Inc., it is a sister station to First Nations Experience (FNX) affiliate WYCC (channel 20) and commercial classical music radio station WFMT (98.7 FM). The three stations share studios in the Renée Crown Public Media Center, located at 5400 North Saint Louis Avenue (adjacent to the main campus of Northeastern Illinois University) in the city's North Park neighborhood; WTTW and WYCC share transmitter facilities atop the Willis Tower on South Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop. WTTW also owns and operates The Chicago Production Center, a video production and editing facility that is operated alongside the three stations. WTTW is one of two PBS member stations serving the Chicago market, alongside Gary, Indiana-licensed WYIN (channel 56). WTTW, along with PBS Wisconsin flagship station WHA-TV in Madison, Wisconsin, serve as default PBS member stations for Rockford as that market does not have a PBS station of its own; both stations are available in that market on local cable providers.

Founded in 1851, the Times has since won 130 Pulitzer Prizes (the most of any newspaper), and has long been regarded within the industry as a national \"newspaper of record\". It is ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S. The paper is owned by The New York Times Company, which is publicly traded. It has been governed by the Sulzberger family since 1896, through a dual-class share structure after its shares became publicly traded. A. G. Sulzberger and his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.—the paper's publisher and the company's chairman, respectively—are the fifth and fourth generation of the family to head the paper. ",

The Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) was established in 1017 as part of the CMB's program, designed to be a research center as well as a medical school. Plans to develop a second school were delayed and ultimately abandoned. The Board ceased to be a division of the Foundation in 1927, and the funding if medical projects in Asia was taken over by the Medical Education division of the Foundation. Ownership of the PUMC was given to the China Medical Board of New York, inc., which was created to support the PUMC and/or similar institutions in the Far East or in the United States. A concluding grant of $10 million from the RF to the China Medical Board, inc. was made in 1947.</p><citation>From the description of China Medical Board Records, 1913-1929. (Unknown).

Rockefeller, by act of the New York State Legislature, \"to promote the well-being of mankind throughout the world\". From its earliest years, several separate organizations and divisions have carried on the Foundation's work in carefully selected fields. In 1913, the International Health Board (originally the International Health Commission) was formed in order to extend the work of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradicationof Hookworm Disease. The following year, the China Medical Board was established as a division of the Foundation to develop modern western medicine in China; the Board ceased to be a division of the Foundation in 1927. In 1919, a formal Medical Education Division was established to carry outa program of medical education outside the United States. With the 1929 reorganization of the Foundation, the International Health Board was disbanded and an International Health Division was organized. The China Medical Board was established as a separately incorporated institution, and the China Medical Board of the Foundation ceased to exist. The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was combined with the Foundation and the Spelman Fund of New York was chartered to continue activities of the LSRM which were not absorbed by the Foundation.</p><p>The Foundation adopted a program which it largely continues today, which included public health work, the advancement of knowledge in the medical and natural sciences, the social sciences, and the arts and humanities.</p><citation>From the description of Rockefeller Foundation Archives,1910-(1912-1989).

Its studios are located in Arlington, Virginia and its broadcast tower is located near Arlington at (38°53′30.0″N 77°07′54.0″W﻿ / ﻿38.891667°N 77.131667°W﻿ / 38.891667; -77.131667). WETA is a grandfathered “superpower” station. The station covers the Washington metropolitan area with the highest analog effective radiated power (ERP) of any FM station in the market with 75,000 watts. This exceeds the maximum analog ERP limit allowed for a Class B FM station, and is also above the maximum allowable analog ERP for the station's antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) according to current FCC rules, which is 32,000 watts at 186 meters.

Seldes served as the editor and drama critic of the seminal modernist magazine The Dial and hosted the NBC television program The Subject is Jazz (1958). He also wrote for other magazines and newspapers like Vanity Fair and the Saturday Evening Post. He was most interested in American popular culture and cultural history. He wrote and adapted for Broadway, including Lysistrata and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the 1930s. Later, he made films, wrote radio scripts and became the first director of television for CBS News and the founding dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. He spent his career analyzing popular culture in America, advocating cultural democracy, and subsequently, calling for public criticism of the media. Near the end of his life, he quipped, \"I've been carrying on a lover's quarrel with the popular arts for years ... It's been fun. Nothing like them.\" ",

Spending much of the 1920s in Europe, Antheil returned to the US in the 1930s, and thereafter spent much of his time composing music for films, and eventually, television. As a result of this work, his style became more tonal. A man of diverse interests and talents, Antheil was constantly reinventing himself. He wrote magazine articles (one accurately predicted the development and outcome of World War II), an autobiography, a mystery novel, and newspaper and music columns. ",

Library. University of California, Library Special Collections)</citation><p>George Antheil was born on July 8, 1900 in Trenton, New Jersey. His parents were Henry William and Wilhelmine Huse Antheil. Although Antheil claimed to be of Polish descent, he was actually German and grew up speaking both German and English. He attended Trenton Central High School, but there is no indication that he graduated. Antheil studied piano lessons at an early age and in 1919 began to study with Constantin Ivanovich Edler von Sternberg at the Sternberg School of Music. He also briefly studied piano at the Settlement Music School. In his autobiography, Bad Boy of Music, Antheil claimed to have been a student alternately at the Curtis Institute of Music and what he refers to as the \"Curtis Settlement School,\" which did not exist. Both of these statements were untrue.</p><p>Antheil traveled around Europe as a concert pianist playing \"modern music\" as well as his own compositions. Antheil became friends with many of the important intellectuals of that time, including Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound. During this time, and for quite a few years after, Antheil was financially subsidized by Mary Louise Curtis Bok (who founded the Curtis Institute of Music). While in Europe, Antheil met a student named Böski Marcus from Hungary. They married in 1925. Antheil's best known piece during the 1920s was a composition entitled Ballet Mécanique scored for piano and percussion. The American premiere of this piece was deemed a failure and Antheil's reputation was never the same.</p><p>In the 1930s, Antheil moved to California and concentrated on writing film scores for such directors as Man Ray and Cecil B. DeMille. He continued to compose symphonies during this time. His 1953 opera, Volpone, opened to mixed reviews, but Antheil continued to write.</p><p>In addition to composing, George Antheil was interested in writing in general. He was a music critic, contributed columns to Esqure and other periodicals, and wrote two detective novels based on his hobby of studying glandular endocrinology. His autobiography, Bad Boy of Music, was a bestseller. Antheil is also credited to co-inventing (with Hedy Lamarr) a torpedo guidance system.</p><p>George Antheil died of a heart attack in 1959.</p><citation>From the guide to the George Antheil Papers, 1919-1959., (Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library)</citation></biogHist>",

      "description": "Margaret Mead (December 16, 1901 – November 15, 1978) was an American cultural anthropologist who featured frequently as an author and speaker in the mass media during the 1960s and 1970s. She earned her bachelor's degree at Barnard College in New York City and her MA and PhD degrees from Columbia University. Mead served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1975. Mead was a communicator of anthropology in modern American and Western culture and was often controversial as an academic. Her reports detailing the attitudes towards sex in South Pacific and Southeast Asian traditional cultures influenced the 1960s sexual revolution. She was a proponent of broadening sexual conventions within the context of Western cultural traditions. ",

It airs local Catholic programming in addition to EWTN Global Catholic Radio. Its programs are simulcast over WSGR, 88.3 FM in New Boston, Ohio. WVSG broadcasts with 5,000 watts during the daytime, and 790 watts at night, from a transmitter site located near Upper Arlington and Grove City. A single non-directional tower is used during the day, offering secondary coverage to almost half of Ohio–as far west as Dayton and the outer suburbs of Cincinnati and as far north as the outer suburbs of Toledo. At night, six towers are used in a directional pattern to protect the signal of the frequency's clear-channel station, WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas, concentrating the signal around the Columbus area. ",

He is regarded as one of the world's outstanding futurists. Toffler was an associate editor of Fortune magazine. In his early works he focused on technology and its impact, which he termed \"information overload.\" In 1970 his first major book about the future, Future Shock, became a worldwide best-seller and has sold over 6 million copies.

      "description": "Ralph W. Tyler (1902–1994) was an American educator who worked in the field of assessment and evaluation. He served on or advised a number of bodies that set guidelines for the expenditure of federal funds and influenced the underlying policy of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Tyler chaired the committee that developed the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). He has been called by some as \"the father of educational evaluation and assessment\". Tyler was born on April 22, 1902, in Chicago to a professional family. His maternal grandfather was in the Civil War and had been appointed as a judge in Washington by president Ulysses S. Grant. His father, William Augustus Tyler, had been raised in a farm, and had become a doctor. Deeply religious, there came a time when both of Tyler's parents thought that the medical profession was too lucrative and that they should realign their priorities, at which point his father became a Congregational minister. As the sixth of eight children, Tyler grew up in Nebraska where he recalled having to trap animals for food and wear donated clothing. He worked at various jobs while growing up, including his first job at age twelve in a creamery. ",

WorldCat record id: 269253099</citation><p>Ralph W. Tyler was born in Chicago, IL on April 22, 1902, the son of Reverend William A. Tyler. He earned his BA at Doane University in Nebraska and his Master's degree in 1923 at the University of Nebraska. Tyler's Ph.D. was granted by the University of Chicago in 1927. After teaching at the University of Nebraska (1922-1927) and the University of North Carolina (1927-1929), Tyler moved to Ohio State University as Professor of Education and Research Associate of the Bureau of Educational Research (1929-1938).</p><p>Tyler specialized in measuring the application of education. Before arriving at the University of Chicago he led \"the eight year study\" which measured to what degree students absorbed information given to them by their teachers. The study showed that children learned best at their own pace and students best retained information compounded by experience. This program led to national testing for pre-college students.</p><p>When Tyler met with the President of the University of Chicago to recommend methods for testing applicants, the thirty five year old professor held a reputation as a progressive educator who smoked cigars constantly and raced cars against trains. Although University of Chicago president Robert Hutchins believed in classical education, in 1938 he risked hiring Tyler as the Chief Examiner and Director of the Board of Examinations, Professor of Education, and Chair of the Department of Education. Tyler accepted and moved to Chicago with his entire testing staff.</p><p>Tyler became acting Dean of Social Sciences when Dean Robert Redfield took a leave of absence in 1946. Tyler was officially appointed as dean in 1948. He streamlined the committees between the departments and promoted interdisciplinary studies. Additionally, Tyler participated in University life by contributing to the Great Books Program and to the Chicago Roundtable radio discussions. Additionally, Tyler continuously published the results of his work.</p><p>Through the course of his tenure at the University of Chicago his positions included: Chairman, Department of Education, University of Chicago (1938-48); University Examiner, University of Chicago (1938-53); Dean, Division of the Social Sciences, University of Chicago (1948-53); Director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California (1953-67); Acting President, Social Science Research Council (1971-72); Vice President, Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions (1975-78); and President, System Development Foundation (1969-until his death?).</p><p>Additionally, Tyler served as the official Director of the Examinations Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces Institute from 1943-1954 during which the military asked him to administer tests to measure the effectiveness of its training programs.</p><p>In the 1960's, Tyler worked with his colleagues on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, measuring educational achievements around the United States. Tyler advised six U.S. Presidents and assisted in writing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. After leaving the University of Chicago in 1953, Tyler moved to California as the founding director of the Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, funded by the Ford Foundation (1953-1967). Throughout the 1980's Tyler commuted from California to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to teach and advise the Coalition for School Improvement.</p><p>Tyler's style of testing became common and was known as the \"Tyler Rationale\". His methods were initially considered unorthodox because he advocated the involvement of teachers and parents at every level of school reform. Tyler believed that the purpose of education was to teach children how to function as citizens. He stated, \"Carrying on citizenship is the most important reason for public education…As society keeps moving forward, we need to have more and more education to understand problems that are much more complex than those that were dealt with in 1776.\"</p><p>Tyler's wife, Flora V. Tyler passed away before he did. Ralph Tyler suffered from cancer and passed away on February 18, 1994. He was survived by his brother, Keith I. Tyler; his daughters, Helen Parisi and Ann Fathy; and his son, Ralph W. Tyler, Jr.</p><p>Some of his more famous projects included: Director of Evaluation, Eight-Year Study (1934-42); Director, Cooperative Study in General Education (1939-45); Director, Examinations Staff, U.S. Armed Forces Institute (1943-53); Chairman, Exploratory Committee on Assessing the Progress of Education (1964-68); and Senior Consultant, Science Research Associates, Inc. (1967-82).</p><p>He was also a member of a number of associations and throughout the course of his career held broad associations well beyond the University of Chicago including: Member, National Advisory Mental Health Council (1959-63); Chairman, National Commission on Resources for Youth (1964-79); Chairman, National Commission for Cooperative Education (1962-75); Honorary Life Chairman (1975-?); President, National Academy of Education (1965-69); Chairman, Research Advisory Council of the U.S. Office of Education (1967-70); Member, National Science Board, 1962-68; Vice Chairman (1966-68); and Member, National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children (1965-72)</p><p>Some of his notable publications were: Constructing Achievement Tests (1934); Appraising and Recording Student Progress, with E.R. Smith (1942); Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction (1949); Educational Evaluation; New Roles, New Means, editor (1969); Crucial Issues in Testing, with R. Wolf (1974); Perspectives on American Education (1976); \"Changing Concepts of Educational Evaluation.\" [Monograph] International Journal of Educational Research 10 (1986).</p><citation>From the guide to the Tyler, Ralph W.

      "description": "The University of Cincinnati (UC or Cincinnati) is a public research university in Cincinnati, Ohio. Founded in 1819 as Cincinnati College, it is the oldest institution of higher education in Cincinnati and is the second largest university in Ohio. It is part of the University System of Ohio. The university has four major campuses with Cincinnati's main campus and medical campus in Clifton Heights and branch campuses in Blue Ash and Clermont. In 1819, Cincinnati College and the Medical College of Ohio were founded in Cincinnati. Local benefactor Dr. Daniel Drake founded and funded the Medical College of Ohio. William Lytle of the Lytle family donated the land, funded the Cincinnati College and Law College, and served as its first president. The college survived only six years before financial difficulties forced it to close. In 1835, Daniel Drake reestablished the institution, which eventually joined with the Cincinnati Law School. \n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, the University of Cincinnati experienced a wave of protest and radicalism on campus, much like other universities throughout the United States. The height of the protest occurred in May of 1970, immediately after the Kent State shootings. UC closed on May 8th due to the fear of possible violence on campus, and later in the month, university administration decided to cancel the remainder of the Spring quarter. -- From the guide to the University of Cincinnati Campus Unrest Collection, 1964-1990, 1964-1990, (University of Cincinnati, Archives and Rare Books Library)",

The eight-story inpatient facility provides patient care services from primary care through and including transplantation, with a medical staff in a variety of specialties. In 1999, the 245,000-square-foot (22,800 m2) Outpatient Care Center (OCC) opened with a fully computerized medical record system, allowing patient records to be accessible electronically. The OCC houses all subspecialty and general medicine outpatient services and the Women's Health Center. The Hospital serves as a referral site for the seriously ill throughout the city, state and world. In fiscal year 2010, approximately 14,000 inpatient and outpatient surgeries were performed, over 57,000 patients visited the emergency department, and 20,000 patients were admitted to the hospital.

The Foundation operates: WGBH-FM, 89.7, Boston; WGBH-TV, Channel 2, Boston; WGBX-TV, Channel 44, Boston; and WGBY-TV, Channel 57, Springfield.

WorldCat record id: 86123368</citation><p>The New Television Workshop originated at WGBH ca. 1974 to serve as a creative center within the WGBH Educational Foundation. Its purpose was to support the development and production of experimental video art works across many disciplines including dance, drama, music, performance and the visual arts. Production was done primarily on video, although some production work was done on film. Fred Barzyk, a WGBH producer and director, was the Workshop's Executive Director from 1974 to 1982. Susan Dowling was Executive Director from 1982 to 1993 at which time the Workshop ceased production at WGBH. Major broadcast series created by the Workshop included \"Artist's Showcase,\" \"Frames of Reference,\" \"Dance for Camera,\" and \"New Television.\" Of individual works, \"Visions\" was created for WNET (New York) and \"Alive From Off Center\" for KTCA (St. Paul-Minneapolis). \"Poetry Breaks,\" a series of poets reading their works which was broadcast between shows as \"filler,\" was co-produced by the Workshop and Leita Hagemann Luchetti.</p><citation>From the description of New Television Workshop Collection, 1967-1999. (Unknown). WorldCat record id: 180705705</citation><p>April 5, 1968, the day after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the City of Boston approached WGBH/Channel 2 with the hopes of broadcasting special programming to ease racial tension in the city. Within six hours of the request, WGBH televised a James Brown concert taking place in the city that evening. In the weeks following the broadcast, WGBH management decided to create a weekly program produced by African Americans that would be about African Americans. The program, called Say Brother, debuted July 15, 1968, and offered a variety of public affairs programming relevant to African American communities throughout the United States, such as the desegregation of schools, civil rights, Black political leadership, religion, African liberation, and popular culture, while ensuring coverage of issues in Boston's African American neighborhoods, such as affordable housing, community clinics and health care facilities, local student movements, state politics, and community schooling.</p><p>Say Brother's early producers included Jim Boyd, Ray Richardson, and John Slade (through 1973) and Topper Carew and Marita Rivero (through the 1975 season). In the fall of 1975, under Rivero's direction, Say Brother aired thirteen programs developed specifically for a national audience for broadcast by PBS. National programming, however, was short-lived, and Say Brother quickly returned to being locally-televised in the winter of 1976. Between the fall of 1976 and spring of 1983, Barbara Barrow-Murray produced the program, significantly adding multicultural content (through the 1980 season) that incorporated issues in Boston's Chinese American, Hispanic American and Native American communities. Successive producers--Beth Deare, Juanita Anderson, and Cynthia Johnson--have continued to program based on social, cultural, economic, and intellectual issues relevant to African Americans. The program was renamed Basic Black in 1998.</p><citation>From the description of Say Brother Television Program Collection,f1968-1982. (Unknown). WorldCat record id: 180705492</citation><p>The Ten O'Clock News was a nightly news program produced and broadcast by WGHBH, a public television station located in Boston, Massachusetts. The Ten O'Clock News succeeded Evening Compass, a news program broadcast on WGBH in 1974 and 1975. Evening Compass found an audience through its in-depth coverage of school desegregation in Boston, which began in 1974. Reporters Pam Bullard, Ed Baumeister, Paul de Give, Gary Griffith, Greg Pilkington, Judy Stoia and others covered press conferences with city officials, protests by activists on both sides of the issue and the effect of court-ordered desegregation on the Boston Public School System. The Ten O'Clock News debuted in 1976, and many of the Evening Compass staff members worked on the show.</p><p>Christopher Lydon signed on to anchor The Ten O'Clock News in 1977, and was joined by a series of four co-anchors, including Gail Harris in 1984 and Carmen Fields in 1987. The program featured nightly in-studio interviews as well as coverage of local, national and international issues by a group of reporters including Christy George, Marcus Jones, Meg Vaillancourt, David Boeri and Hope Kelly. The program was broadcast on WGBH until May 1991. The Ten O'Clock News Project has preserved 523 tapes from the Ten O'Clock News library. The tapes focus on news stories related to Boston's African American community, and include coverage of school desegregation in Boston, race relations, politics, education, health care, urban issues and the arts.</p><citation>From the description of The Ten O'Clock News Project, 1974-1991.

Yle (Finnish: [ˈyle]), is Finland's national public broadcasting company, founded in 1926. It is a joint-stock company which is 99.98% owned by the Finnish state, and employs around 3,200 people in Finland. Yle shares many of its organizational characteristics with its UK counterpart, the BBC, on which it was largely modelled. For the greater part of Yle's existence the company was funded by the revenues obtained from a broadcast receiving licence fee payable by the owners of radio sets (1927–1976) and television sets (1958–2012), as well as receiving a portion of the broadcasting licence fees payable by private television broadcasters. Since the beginning of 2013 the licence fee has been replaced by a public broadcasting tax (known as the Yle tax), which is collected annually from private individuals and corporations together with their other taxes.

It joined NPR in 1976 and was the first public radio station in the country—and the first station of any kind in Florida—to launch HD radio. WUSF's current format features news and talk programming during the day and jazz at night, and variety programming on weekends from NPR and other sources, including A Prairie Home Companion and Car Talk. Its HD Radio feed features classical music from sister station WSMR. ",

The school, which is located at the downtown Phoenix campus, offers several undergraduate and graduate programs in journalism, and in fall 2011, launched its first doctoral program in journalism and mass communication. The Cronkite School began as the Division of Journalism under the ASU's English Department in 1949, 18 years after ASU began to offer journalism courses to its students, in 1931. The school began to expand in 1954, when radio and television journalism courses were made available. The entire Division of Journalism was elevated to department by the University in 1957, and changed its name to Department of Mass Communication. The school moved from its original location at Old Main to what is now the Academic Services building at ASU Tempe in 1969. ",

Founded in 1917, the school is located on Claremont Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of New York City, adjacent to Broadway and West 122nd Street (Seminary Row). The MSM campus was originally the home to The Institute of Musical Art (which later became Juilliard) until Juilliard migrated to the Lincoln Center area of Midtown Manhattan. The property was originally owned by the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum until The Institute of Musical Art purchased it in 1910. The campus of Columbia University is close by, where it has been since 1895. Many of the students live in the school's residence hall, Andersen Hall. ",

Slater made the majority of his appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers, with whom he won three league championships and the FA Cup. Slater started his career as a 16-year-old amateur at Blackpool in 1944 and played in the 1951 FA Cup Final in which Blackpool lost to Newcastle United, becoming the last amateur to play in an FA Cup Final at Wembley. Another record he jointly holds is Blackpool's fastest-ever goal: 11 seconds into a game against Stoke City on 10 December 1949. This was matched by James Quinn in 1995. Slater made his Blackpool debut on 10 September 1949, in a goalless draw at Aston Villa. As an inside-forward, he competed with Allan Brown for the number 10 position for the majority of his time at the seaside. ",

He is best known for developing a humanistic approach to science, and as the presenter and writer of the thirteen-part 1973 BBC television documentary series, and accompanying book, The Ascent of Man, which led to his regard as \"one of the world's most celebrated intellectuals\". Bronowski's family moved to Germany and then to England while he was a child. In England, he won a scholarship to study mathematics at the University of Cambridge. His interests have been described as ranging \"widely, from biology to poetry and from chess to Humanism\". He taught mathematics at the University College Hull between 1934 and 1942. During World War II he led the field of operations research and worked to increase the effectiveness of Allied bombing. After the war he headed the projects division of UNESCO. Bronowski wrote poetry and had a deep affinity with William Blake. From 1950 to 1963 he worked for the National Coal Board in England. From 1963 he was a resident fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, until his death in 1974 in East Hampton, New York, just a year after the airing of his Ascent of Man. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Professor of English, Northwestern University, 1932-1974; short-story writer; radio/tv game show panelist; faculty member, Famous Writers' School; co-author, The Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage (1957).</p><citation>From the description of Bergan Evans Papers, 1921-1978. (Unknown). WorldCat record id: 122605099</citation><p>Bergen Baldwin Evans was born on September 19, 1904 in Franklin, Ohio, the third child of Rice Kemper and Louise Cass Evans' six children. Evans joined the faculty of Northwestern University as in the department of English in 1932. He was an incredibly popular instructor, and remained at Northwestern until his retirement in 1974. In addition to his career as an English scholar, Evans was an author and was involved with many television and radio programs. He died in 1978.</p><p>In 1909 Evans' father, a fourth generation doctor, gave up his practice to accept a clerkship in the consular service in Sheffield, England. The family lived there until 1915 when Rice Evans' salary could no longer support his large family. That and the outbreak of World War I forced him to send his children back to America to live with an aunt in Franklin, Ohio.</p><p>Bergen Evans was educated in both English and American schools and entered Miami University in Oxford, Ohio at the age of fifteen. Despite nearly being dismissed after his first year as a result of his unorthodox study habits, Evans graduated in 1924 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. After earning an M.A. from Harvard in 1925 he returned to Miami University and taught English from 1925 to 1928. Thereafter he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar from 1929 to 1931, receiving a B.Litt. degree in 1930. He returned to Harvard where he received a Ph.D. in English Philology in 1932. The subject of his dissertation was Samuel Johnson's career as a biographer.</p><p>In September of 1932, Evans began his teaching career at Northwestern as an Instructor in English. He remained at Northwestern until his retirement in 1974, being promoted to Assistant Professor in 1936, Associate Professor in 1939, and Professor in 1944. His courses, in particular, Introduction to Literature, became extremely popular, enrolling more students than any other course offered at the university.</p><p>Evans simultaneously pursued a second career as an author, publishing short stories in national magazines. As a result he won the Scribner Prize in 1939. As a feature writer for the American Mercury from 1947 to 1950 he contributed a column entitled \"The Skeptics Corner.\" Evans also published a number of books, with the first coming about by chance. Teaching in the university's Evening Division he became acquainted with a student, Herman Bishop, a mechanic, with whom he wrote Your Car is Made to Last, a car repair book for the layman. Evans second book, The Psychiatry of Robert Burton, written with G.J. Mohr in 1944, analyzed Burton's grasp of modern psychology while writing in the 17th century. His first book to gain popular attention was The Natural History of Nonsense (1946). He next published The Spoor of Spooks and Other Nonsense (1954) as a result of his long-standing interest in myths and superstitions.</p><p>Evans' major contribution to scholarship was The Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage, which he authored in collaboration with his sister, Cornelia Evans Goodhue, in 1957. A vocabulary-building book containing chapters on British-American vocabulary, Word-A-Day, was released in 1963. Evans also wrote two reference works: Dictionary of Quotations (1968) and Dictionary of Mythology (1970). Evans also edited anthologies and literary works, including two relating to Samuel Johnson, and wrote essays, book introductions, and textbook chapters, as well as numerous magazine and newspaper articles, and delivered numerous lectures.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Evans appeared on television and radio. After appearing briefly in a television program entitled \"Majority Rules,\" Evans became a nationally known personality through \"Down You Go,\" a program based on the parlor game \"hang the butcher.\" The program originated in Chicago and ran from 1951 - 1956 and was revived from 1961 - 1963.</p><p>Evans was also involved in several other television and radio panel shows through the 1950s and early 1960s, including \"Of Many Things,\" \"Superghost,\" \"English for Americans,\" \"Inquiry,\" \"The Last Word,\" \"Words in the News,\" and \"Conversation.\" For most of these programs Evans commuted to New York every weekend.</p><p>Although he did not appear on the program, beginning in 1955 Evans prepared questions used on the television game show \"The $64,000 Question.\" In 1959 the producers of the show were accused of coaching contestants, including giving them the questions in advance. Illinois State Representative Peter F. Mack, Jr. accused Evans of having been a part of the scandal and called for his resignation from Northwestern. Evans emerged from the scandal unscathed, having received the full support of his students and Northwestern president J. Roscoe Miller.</p><p>Evans retired from teaching in May of 1974, having taught three years past the University's mandatory retirement age of 68. He died on February 4, 1978.</p><p>Evans married Jean Whinery on August 5, 1939. They had two sons, Derek and Scott. Among the many honors Evans received during his long and productive career were the 1957 Peabody Award for outstanding public service in broadcasting, honorary degrees from Miami (Ohio) University in 1959 and Franklin and Marshall College and the Ohioana Career Medal in 1972.</p><citation>From the guide to the Bergen Evans (1904-1978) Papers, 1921-1978, (Northwestern University Archives)</citation><p>Ashley Montagu, born Israel Ehrenberg on June 28, 1905, was a British-American anthropologist, specializing in the areas of race and gender issues, as well as a prolific speaker and author, publishing over 50 books in his lifetime. The son of Jewish tailor Charles Ehrenberg and his wife, Mary Plot Ehrenberg, Montagu was born and raised in London's working class East End neighborhood. Although the reasoning behind his name change was never revealed, it may have been due to anti-Semitic prejudice faced by many East End Jews during his childhood, and Montagu might have felt the need to distance himself from his parents' Russian and Polish backgrounds.</p><p>Montagu earned his undergraduate degree from University College London in psychology and anthropology. After studying anthropology at the London School of Economics under Bronislaw Malinowski, Montagu left England for the United States. He arrived at New York City in 1927 and began taking graduate classes at Columbia University. Montagu then traveled to Italy in 1928, where he took classes in ethnography and anthropology at the University of Florence. Upon his return to the United States in 1931, while working as an assistant professor of anthropology at New York University, Montagu married Marjorie Peakes. The couple would have two daughters, Audrey and Barbara, as well as a son, Geoffrey. In 1934 Montagu returned to Columbia University, culminating his postgraduate work at Columbia in 1936 with his dissertation, Coming into being among the Australian Aborigines: A study of the procreative beliefs of the native tribes of Australia, produced under the direction of Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. Based largely on his dissertation, Montagu's first book, Coming into Being among the Australian Aborigines, was published in 1937. After he completed his education, Montagu taught anatomy at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1938 and became an American citizen in 1940. It was during his time at Hahnemann that he began to produce work relating to race, resulting in his seminal work, Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race, published in 1942. The work controversially advanced the argument that race was a social construct imposed upon a complex biological substratum and demolished the arguments for inherent inequality between human populations. The influential nature of Man's Most Dangerous Myth led to Montagu's service on the 4th United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) task force, in 1949. The ten member UNESCO committee, composed of such world-renowned social scientists as Claude Levi-Strauss and E. Franklin Frazier, was created to collect information about the problem of race and to establish educational programs to disseminate its findings. The resultant document, authored by Montagu, the group's rapporteur, was published as the \"Statement on Race\" in 1951. The Committee's final statement on race asserted: 1)All mankind belong to the same species and that the differences between groups are few compared to all of the genetic similarities. 2)That Race designates a group with high frequency of physical characteristics or particular genetic trait and that these traits fluctuate or even disappear over time. 3)The way in which people are grouped does not reflect the capacity or character traits of a particular group. The differences between races are physical and have no correlation with other traits like intelligence.</p><p>Upon leaving Hahnemann Medical College in 1949, Montagu moved to Rutgers University, where he was a professor of anthropology and head of the department from 1949 to 1955. While at Rutgers, Montagu wrote perhaps his most famous work, The Natural Superiority of Women, published in 1953. Examining the differences between the sexes anthropologically, Montagu concluded that women were the superior sex because they possessed a better capability to survive both as individuals and in groups- talents necessary for an advancing society. Based on these conclusions, he suggested that women receive equal pay for equal work, a controversial stance at the time.</p><p>With his prolific writing skills to rely on financially, and facing strong backlash for his openly liberal views and anti-McCarthy public statements, Montagu accepted a forced retirement from Rutgers in 1955 at the age of 50. Though retired from academic life, he continued to lecture at such institutions as Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Santa Barbara, and New York University. Settling in Princeton, New Jersey, Montagu's work took up a more humanist element with Touching: The Human Significance of the Skin, his effort to encourage parents to take a more physical role in raising their children and especially to encourage mothers to breastfeed their babies. Published during that same year, Montagu's book The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity, a history of the life of disfigured Briton Joseph Merrick, inspired a Tony winning play and later a motion picture. He continued publishing through the 1980s, including The Nature of Human Aggression (1976) and Growing Young (1981), while making numerous and notable television appearances on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show as well as the Phil Donahue Show.</p><p>In his lifetime, Montagu received many major awards, among them the American Association of Humanists' 1995 Man of the Year award, the Darwin Award from the American Association of Physical Anthropologist in 1994, and the Distinguished Achievement Award from the American Anthropological Association in 1987. Montagu maintained an active schedule of lecturing and gardening around his Princeton, New Jersey, home until he was hospitalized in March 1999; he died on November 26, 1999 from heart disease, at the age of ninety-four. He was survived by his wife of sixty-eight years, Marjorie, as well as his son and two daughters.</p><citation>From the guide to the Ashley Montagu papers, 1927-1999, 1927-1999, (American Philosophical Society)</citation></biogHist>",

She is known for large-scale paintings that combine a variety of art historical references and painterly techniques. She lives and works in Los Angeles, California. In 2013, she turned her studio work space into an exhibition space called 356 Mission, in collaboration with art dealer Gavin Brown and Wendy Yao. Soon after, she hosted a second location with the art bookstore Ooga Booga #2 in the front of the building. The 356 Mission art space closed in 2019, due to the lease ending. ",

      "description": "Curt Gerhard Westphal, stage name Gert Westphal, (5 October 1920 – 10 November 2002) was a German-Swiss actor, audiobook narrator, recitator and director, one of the best-known audiobook narrators and speakers in German, described as \"König der Vorleser\" (king of recitators) and \"der Caruso der Vorleser\" (the Caruso among recitators). After his reading of her husband's works, Katia Mann called him \"des Dichters oberster Mund\" (the poet's principal voice). The literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki said he was probably the best reciter of German. Born in Dresden as the son of a culturally interested factory director, Westphal attended the Realgymnasium in Blasewitz, graduating with the Abitur. He trained in acting with Paul Hoffmann at the Dresdner Staatsschauspielhaus, where he made his stage debut in 1940 in a minor role in Goethe's Götz von Berlichingen. He was then drafted for military service and later became a prisoner of war. In 1946 he moved to Bremen, where he was both a member of the Kammerspiele Bremen [de] and a speaker for Radio Bremen. From 1948, he headed the broadcaster's audio play division. In 1953, he took the same position with Südwestfunk in Baden-Baden where he remained until 1959. He was in contact with authors such as Alfred Andersch, Ingeborg Bachmann, Gottfried Benn, Max Frisch and Carl Zuckmayer. He commissioned new audio plays and collaborated with Max Ophüls, Will Quadflieg, Hans Paetsch, Oskar Werner, Walter Jens and Joachim Fest. ",

      "description": "<biogHist><p>Thomas Joseph Dodd, the third generation of his family to reside in Connecticut, was born in Norwich on 15 May 1907. During his career he served two terms in the U.S. Senate, and became well known for his work on the Nuremburg Trials where he served as Vice-Chairman of the Review Board and Executive Trial Counsel. After an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 1970, Dodd retired from public life and died in 1971 at the age of 64.</p><citation>From the description of Thomas J. Dodd papers, 1919-1971. (University of Connecticut). WorldCat record id: 75959581</citation><p>Thomas Joseph Dodd, the third generation of his family to reside in Connecticut, was born in Norwich on 15 May 1907. Young Thomas received consistent training in Roman Catholicism, a regimen that significantly shaped his world view as an adult. He attended Norwich public schools and graduated from St. Anselm's Preparatory School in 1926. The future two-term Democratic senator earned a bachelor's degree from Providence College in 1930 and received a law degree from Yale University in 1933. He served as the president of the Yale Democratic Club and led a group of young liberals, the \"Flying Wedge\", to speak on behalf of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal.</p><p>In 1934 Dodd married the former Grace Murphy of Westerly, Rhode Island and the couple proceeded to raise a family of six children: Thomas J., Jr., Carolyn, Jeremy, Martha, Christopher, and Nicholas.</p><p>In the same year U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, another Connecticut native, was so impressed with Dodd's work at Yale that he convinced the young attorney to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Dodd became a Special Agent and participated in the apprehension of such notorious criminals as John Dillinger, \"Babyface\" Nelson, and the Bremer kidnappers.</p><p>In 1935 Dodd was appointed Director of the National Youth Administration for Connecticut, a position future president Lyndon B. Johnson held for Texas . The NYA aimed to create educational and employment opportunities for young people struggling through the Great Depression. Dodd served as a delegate to the 1936 Democratic national convention. His meteoric rise continued in 1938 with entry into the U.S. Justice Department as a Special Assistant to the Attorney General. He played a pivotal role in the creation of the department's first Civil Rights Division. Dodd's more noteworthy cases included prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina and defending labor's right to organize and bargain collectively in Georgia.</p><p>During World War II, Dodd handled cases involving espionage and sabotage that helped cripple Nazi fifth column efforts to destabilize the United States war effort. His work led to the convictions of Reverend Kurt Molzahn, Wilhelm Kunge, Otto Willimanti, and Count Anostase Vonsiatsky on spying charges. Dodd also helped uncover industrial fraud by American firms supplying military hardware, including such New England companies as Anaconda Wire and Cable, Collyer Insulated Wire, Arrow Machine Tool, and Lincoln Machine .</p><p>As the war ended, the Allied Powers prepared to convene a military tribunal to prosecute accused Nazi war criminals. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, the head of the American legal team, requested that Dodd join the jurists assembling at Nuremberg, Germany . Dodd served as Vice-Chairman of the Review Board and Executive Trial Counsel. The latter position rendered Dodd the second ranking U.S. lawyer and s supervisor of the day-to-day management of the U.S. prosecution team. He shaped many of the strategies and policies through which this unprecedented trial took place and frequently dealt with other Allied legal notables such as Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe of Great Britain and Lieutenant General Roman Rudenko of the Soviet Union . Dodd concentrated upon proving the charge of conspiracy to wage aggressive war and consequently cross-examined German industrialists as well as military and political leaders. He reconstructed the will of the last president of the Weimar Republic, Paul von Hindenburg, to reveal that the Nazis had falsified this document to help justify Chancellor Adolph Hitler 's consolidation of power.</p><p>Dodd presented portions of virtually every aspect of the prosecution's case. He developed a degree of notoriety for displaying the shrunken head of a concentration camp inmate during the trial. Some attorneys deemed such behavior grandstanding and they did not appreciate Dodd's flair for the dramatic. As one of the few civilian lawyers among the U.S. prosecutors, Dodd privately expressed an acute self-consciousness of his unique status. He also experienced the intense loneliness common among Nuremberg staffers separated from their families.</p><p>Dodd's Nuremberg work enhanced his stature and visibility back in the United States . He received a Presidential Citation, the U.S. Medal of Freedom, and the Czechoslovakian Order of the White Lion for his outstanding efforts. In 1949 the Polish government, then dominated by Moscow, offered him a prestigious award for service at Nuremberg. Dodd responded with a scathing, public denunciation of Communism in which he refused to accept honors from a regime that he perceived as barely distinct from National Socialism.</p><p>Upon his return to America in 1946, Dodd began the private practice of law in Hartford and entered Connecticut politics. He sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1948 against a better-known candidate, Chester Bowles, without ever formally announcing his candidacy. Democratic State Chairman John M. Bailey threw his support behind the more liberal Bowles for fear that the potential third party presidential bid of Henry Wallace would splinter Democrats through the People's Party in Connecticut. Bailey then began a \"Draft Dodd\" movement for lieutenant governor, but Dodd refused to join what he perceived as a sellout to Communist sympathizers. He focused instead upon civic, charity, and service work. In 1950 Dodd returned to public life to campaign vigorously on behalf of Connecticut Senator Brien McMahon against Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy 's efforts to unseat him. Despite his ardent anticommunism, Dodd resisted the overly zealous red-baiting of the Cold War. McMahon triumphed in the ensuing election and Democrats encouraged Dodd to pursue a political career.</p><p>Dodd won election to Congress from the First Congressional District in 1952 and was reelected two years later. He was the only Connecticut Democrat to sit in the U.S. House during this period. Dodd served on the Government Operations and Foreign Affairs Committees, as well as the Select Committee to Investigate Communist Aggression. After unsuccessfully running for the U.S. Senate in 1956 against Republican incumbent Prescott Bush, Dodd ran again and defeated Republican William A. Purtell in 1958. Earlier that year he had received the Commander of the Order of Merit award from the President of Italy for counsel provided to help prevent a Communist seizure of power.</p><p>Dodd served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-chaired its Internal Security Subcommittee. He sat on the Judiciary Committee and chaired its Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee. A brief tenure on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee completed Dodd's legislative assignments.</p><p>Dodd championed a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's gun control legislation long before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy with a mail-order rifle. He eventually secured passage of a firearms bill in 1968, legislation that fell far short of his initial expectations. He ardently supported the civil rights legislation of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, particularly with respect to anti-lynching and voting rights laws. Dodd strove to protect children through measures such as curbing the violence on television and stemming the traffic of illegal drugs.</p><p>Dodd vigorously opposed Soviet Communism, which he considered the moral equivalent of German Nazism. He similarly warned against admitting Communist China to the United Nations and advocated the formation of \"freedom academies\" to raise anticommunism to a scholarly level. Although an early and ardent supporter of the United Nations, Dodd grew increasingly disillusioned with this organization as it gradually became more representative of Third World interests. In 1968 he called for the resignation of U.N. Secretary General U Thant for opposing the U.S. presence in Vietnam.</p><p>President Johnson briefly considered naming Dodd as his vice-presidential running mate in 1964, but opted instead for Senator Hubert Humphrey . The publicity surrounding the vice-presidential selection may have served as a reward for Dodd's support of Johnson during the 1960 presidential campaign. In 1964 Johnson enthusiastically endorsed Dodd during a campaign swing through Connecticut and Dodd won his second Senate term with a landslide victory over former Republican governor John D. Lodge . Dodd evolved into a sort of unofficial foreign policy spokesman in the Senate for the Johnson administration. When the President authorized an incursion into the Dominican Republic in 1965, Dodd emerged as one of the administration's most outspoken defenders. Such behavior exacerbated a growing feud between Dodd and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright of Arkansas . The two exchanged condemnatory press releases and subsequently clashed over Vietnam .</p><p>Dodd consciously cultivated an image of himself as a party maverick. In part this stance reflected his poor relationship with John M. Bailey . He championed electoral reform during his 1958 Senate campaign in order to, in effect, \"democratize\" the nomination process against better known candidates such as Abraham Ribicoff . His proposals included a direct primary for all major state offices, the election of the party chairman by the state convention, a binding presidential preference primary, public hearings before creating a party platform, court reform, and reduction of patronage. Dodd's independence from his party extended beyond the state level. In the Senate, he displayed a relatively low degree of partisanship as measured against his Democratic colleagues. Dodd did not hesitate to criticize the Kennedy administration for waging what he perceived as an ineffective campaign against the Castro regime in Cuba . He provided strong support to the Nixon administration over Vietnam at a time when the Democratic Party experienced deep divisions over this and other issues. He never enjoyed particularly amiable relations with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield because Dodd often publicly questioned his party's leadership and policies.</p><p>In 1966 allegations of financial impropriety surfaced against Thomas Dodd. The Senate began holding hearings the following year to investigate Dodd for his alleged transgressions. Senator Russell Long (D-La.) conducted a vigorous and ultimately unsuccessful campaign to clear Dodd's name. The Senate voted 92-5 to censure him for diverting public funds for private use (primarily through the use of testimonial dinners). He escaped censure on the charge of double billing the government by a vote of 51-45.</p><p>In 1970 Dodd withdrew his name from consideration by the Democratic State Convention after learning that he would not receive renomination for the Senate. He proceeded to mount an unsuccessful independent campaign against Republican Lowell Weicker and Democrat Joe Duffy . Dodd retired from public life following Weicker's triumph. He died in his Old Lyme home on 24 May 1971, at the age of 64.</p><citation>From the guide to the Thomas J. Dodd Papers, undated, 1919-1971., (Archives &amp; Special Collections at the Thomas J.

      "description": "Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev[n 1] (27 April [O.S. 15 April] 1891 – 5 March 1953)[n 2] was a Russian Soviet composer, pianist and conductor. As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres, he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century. His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from The Love for Three Oranges, the suite Lieutenant Kijé, the ballet Romeo and Juliet—from which \"Dance of the Knights\" is taken—and Peter and the Wolf. Of the established forms and genres in which he worked, he created – excluding juvenilia – seven completed operas, seven symphonies, eight ballets, five piano concertos, two violin concertos, a cello concerto, a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra, and nine completed piano sonatas. A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915, Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev—Chout, Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son—which, at the time of their original production, all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel. Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges, composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia. ",

The station is owned by City College, although their transmitter and antenna are located near their partner college, Mesa College, located north of City College, in Kearny Mesa. KSDS, founded in 1951, began programming jazz in 1973 and in 1985 became San Diego's only full-time jazz and blues station. KSDS is licensed by the FCC as a non-commercial, non-profit educational radio station and, for many years, operated with 3,000 watts at 88.3 MHz FM. In 2007, KSDS was granted a Construction Permit by the Federal Communications Commission allowing the station to increase its power to 22,000 watts, greatly improving the signal coverage area. They also feature a live stream and a playlist archive at their website. ",

He is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century, with a unique harmonic language and a historic importance due to his years of work under Stalin. Shostakovich achieved fame in the Soviet Union under the patronage of the Soviet chief of staff Mikhail Tukhachevsky, but later had a complex and difficult relationship with the government. Nevertheless, he received accolades and state awards and served in the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR (1947) and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (from 1962 until his death). ",

      "description": "Amherst College (/ˈæmərst/ (listen) AM-ərst) is a private liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts. Founded in 1821 as an attempt to relocate Williams College by its then-president Zephaniah Swift Moore, Amherst is the third oldest institution of higher education in Massachusetts. The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after Jeffery, Lord Amherst, Commander-in-Chief of British forces of North America during the French and Indian War. Originally established as a men's college, Amherst became coeducational in 1975. Amherst is an exclusively undergraduate four-year institution; the school enrolled 1,855 students in fall 2018. Admissions is highly selective, and it frequently ranks at or near the top in most rankings of liberal arts schools. Students choose courses from 38 major programs in an open curriculum and are not required to study a core curriculum or fulfill any distribution requirements; students may also design their own interdisciplinary major. Amherst competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference. Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries with Williams College and Wesleyan University, which form the Little Three colleges. The college is also a member of the Five College Consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four other Pioneer Valley institutions: Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

His mother died in 1918 when he was 6, and his father, who was an insurance salesman, later married a woman who had her own children. By the late 1920s, he was homeless and sleeping on park benches. He took odd jobs in theaters and occasionally he read poetry on the radio. There he met the Australian opera singer Leah Frances Russell (1891–1983), who became his mentor and benefactor. She introduced him to her daughter, Sheila Russell, whom he later married. They were married for 47 years, until her death in 1983. Shayon died on June 28, 2008 in Frankfort, Kentucky. ",

      "description": "Robert Francis Kennedy (November 20, 1925 – June 6, 1968), also referred to by his initials RFK or by the nickname Bobby, was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 64th United States Attorney General from January 1961 to September 1964, and as a U.S. Senator from New York from January 1965 until his assassination in June 1968. He was, like his brothers John and Edward, a prominent member of the Democratic Party and has come to be viewed by some historians as an icon of modern American liberalism. Kennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. After serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1944 to 1946, Kennedy returned to his studies at Harvard University, and later received his law degree from the University of Virginia. He began his career as a correspondent for The Boston Post and as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, but later resigned to manage his brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1952. The following year, he worked as an assistant counsel to the Senate committee chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He gained national attention as the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Rackets Committee from 1957 to 1959, where he publicly challenged Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa over the union's corrupt practices. Kennedy resigned from the committee to conduct his brother's successful campaign in the 1960 presidential election. He was appointed United States Attorney General at the age of 36, becoming the youngest Cabinet member in U.S. history since Alexander Hamilton in 1789. He served as his brother's closest advisor until his 1963 assassination. ",

      "description": "College of San Mateo (CSM) is a public community college in San Mateo, California. It is part of the San Mateo County Community College District. College of San Mateo is located at the northern corridor of Silicon Valley and situated on a 153-acre site in the San Mateo hills. The campus was designed by architect John Carl Warnecke. The college currently serves approximately 10,000 day, evening and weekend students. The college offers 79 A.A./A.S. degree majors, 75 certificate programs and approximately 100 transfer areas and majors. William L. Glascock, the principal of San Mateo High School, first proposed a junior college for San Mateo in the early 1920s as an alternative to the traditional four-year college. Tuition at the four-year institutions cost up to US$1,000 (equivalent to $15,000 in 2020) per year; at the junior college, students could instead live at home while earning credit equivalent to the freshman and sophomore years of a four-year school. The college was initially founded as the San Mateo Junior College (SMJC) after being approved by voters on March 31, 1922. :8–10 The first classes started on August 22 of that year in a building shared with San Mateo High School. The first registered student was Marjorie Brace, who could not attend Stanford because of the high cost of tuition. She joined an initial class of 30 students, which would grow to 48 by the end of the academic year. :9–11 The typical target for students graduating from the junior college was either Berkeley or Stanford; although the junior college was \"in a valley between two mountains of conceit—Stanford and the University of California\" as described by early faculty, the curriculum at San Mateo was designed to allow graduating students to continue studies at the larger four-year institutions. :10 ",

It first began broadcasting in 1961 under the call sign WPFR. The station is currently owned by Duey E. Wright through licensee Midwest Communications, Inc. The station signed on in 1961 as WPFR. When its companion station AM 1300 (now WIBQ) became WPFR on March 17, 1983, the call sign was changed to WPFR-FM with a Top 40/CHR format, as \"WPFR, The All New Power 103\". The company that owned WPFR and WPFR-FM went into bankruptcy and both stations went off the air in 1991. Bomar Broadcasting purchased the license for 102.7 FM in 1992 and changed the call sign to WLEZ on April 1, 1992. In September 1993, the station went back on the air with a beautiful music format after a new transmitter was constructed. By 1997, the format had shifted to a soft adult contemporary format which eventually was supplied by Jones Radio Network.",

The Mutual Security Agency was established by the passing of the Mutual Security Act by the United States Congress on October 10, 1951. The purpose of the agency was, in the words of the Act, to organize \"military, economic, and technical assistance to friendly countries to strengthen the mutual security and individual and collective defenses of the free world, to develop their resources in the interest of their security and independence and the national interest of the United States and to facilitate the effective participation of those countries in the United Nations system for collective security\". The agency superseded the Economic Cooperation Administration, which had only oversight over economic aid. The new agency was responsible for development and administration of those military and economic assistance programs not administered by the Technical Cooperation Administration. ",

His father was a physician for the railroad in Wyoming, and they were living in a boxcar at the time of Jack's birth. To avoid giving birth in a boxcar his mother LaVaughn went home to Nebraska. The family settled in Worland, Wyoming, in 1905, where Jack Gage would grow up the only child of Will and LaVaughn. He graduated from Worland High School in 1918. After graduation he enlisted in the United States Army and served in Artillery during World War I. He was honorably discharged in 1919 and went on to complete his education at the University of Wyoming. He graduated in 1924 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Agriculture. While in College he met his wife Leona Switzer from Gillette, Wyoming. They were married September 29, 1922. They had two children, Jack R. Gage Jr., born in 1926, and Richard (Dick) C. Gage, born in 1928.</p><p>Jack R. Gage was a Vocational Agriculture teacher from 1924-1925 at the Cambell County High School in Gillette, Wyoming. From 1929-1934 he was a Geology and Biology teacher at Sheridan High School in Sheridan, Wyoming. In 1934 he quit teaching at Sheridan High School in order to run for Wyoming State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He won the election and served a term of four years, but he failed to get reelected in 1938. There are claims that this position made him the first graduate of the University of Wyoming to hold a state office. In 1941 he was appointed Postmaster in Sheridan, Wyoming. He worked there for seventeen years until 1958. During this time he became involved in Rotary and was the District Governor from 1956-1957. He also wrote the historical novel \"Tensleep and No Rest\" and won the Crusade for Freedom award for a peace plan he had submitted. For three weeks in June of 1957 he went to Russia, and he would later give talks about his visit. In 1958 he resigned as the Sheridan Postmaster in order to run for Secretary of State on the Democratic ticket.</p><p>He won the election in 1958 and served as Wyoming Secretary of State until 1961. In 1960, after Wyoming Senator Keith Thomson died, Governor Joe Hickey was appointed to replace Thomson in the Senate. On January 2, 1961, Joe Hickey resigned as governor in order to take the new appointment. That same day Jack Gage became the Acting Governor of Wyoming until January 7, 1963, when his term expired. Jack Gage ran for Governor in 1962. He won in the primary, beating William \"Scotty\" Jack, but lost in the general election to Cliff Hansen. After 1963 Jack Gage became a well known speaker and was invited to speak at many functions. He also was a published author of historical novels and articles on Wyoming and the West, such as \" The Geography of Wyoming,\" \"Tensleep and No Rest,\" and \" The Horse, The Buggy, The Doctor.\" Jack Gage died of cancer on March 14, 1970, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, at the age of 71.</p><citation>From the guide to the Jack R.

The Twin Cities campus comprises locations in Minneapolis and Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) apart. The Twin Cities campus is the oldest and largest in the University of Minnesota system and has the ninth-largest main campus student body in the United States, with 51,327 students in 2019–20. It is the flagship institution of the University of Minnesota System, and is organized into 19 colleges, schools, and other major academic units. The Minnesota Territorial Legislature drafted a charter for the U of M as a territorial university in 1851, seven years before Minnesota became a state. Today, the university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". Minnesota is a member of the Association of American Universities and is ranked 17th in research activity, with $954 million in research and development expenditures in the fiscal year 2018. In 2001, the University of Minnesota was included in a list of Public Ivy universities, which includes publicly funded universities thought to provide a quality of education comparable to that of the Ivy League.

      "description": "KFJC (89.7 FM) is a non-commercial college radio station in Los Altos Hills, California at Foothill College, using a variety radio format that features a broad spectrum of music styles and public affairs programming. KFJC's over-the-air broadcast is 24/7 and can be heard within the southern San Francisco Bay Area. KFJC's mission is to be a conduit for new and interesting audio art and information.[citation needed] KFJC's music programming is largely oriented to recent material from many different genres. Most programs must play at least 35%[citation needed] (by song count) tracks from material added in the last 8 weeks. The station is licensed to the trustees of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District and operated as a teaching laboratory for the Fine Arts and Communications Department of Foothill College. KFJC, as a community radio station, is almost entirely[vague] funded by listener contributions. The cost of running the station, which is staffed entirely by volunteers, is approximately $100,000 per year[citation needed]. KFJC does have some financial underwriting from local businesses which provides the station. ",

      "description": "The Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA), located in Midtown Detroit, Michigan, has one of the largest and most significant art collections in the United States. With over 100 galleries, it covers 658,000 square feet (61,100 m2) with a major renovation and expansion project completed in 2007 that added 58,000 square feet (5,400 m2). The DIA collection is regarded as among the top six museums in the United States with an encyclopedic collection which spans the globe from ancient Egyptian and European works to contemporary art. Its art collection is valued in billions of dollars, up to $8.1 billion according to a 2014 appraisal. The DIA campus is located in Detroit's Cultural Center Historic District, about two miles (3 km) north of the downtown area, across from the Detroit Public Library near Wayne State University. The museum building is highly regarded by architects. The original building, designed by Paul Philippe Cret, is flanked by north and south wings with the white marble as the main exterior material for the entire structure. The campus is part of the city's Cultural Center Historic District listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The museum's first painting was donated in 1883 and its collection consists of over 65,000 works. With about 677,500 visitors annually for 2015, the DIA is among the most visited art museums in the world. The Detroit Institute of Arts hosts major art exhibitions; it contains a 1,150-seat theatre designed by architect C. Howard Crane, a 380-seat hall for recitals and lectures, an art reference library, and a conservation services laboratory. ",
