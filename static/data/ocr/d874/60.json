The various grants-in-aid\nof the NAEB have therefore been principally devoted to helping educational\nradio and television stations and production centers and their parent institu¬\ntions, to improve their competence, facilities, program output, and the local\nand educational respect they enjoy, in order that the entire movement may\nmove forward soundly."
