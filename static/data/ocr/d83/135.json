It will be avail¬\nable for loan to you and others.\nThe Gutenberg video in Detroit will not be made\nbefore the end of April.\nApril 10 to 12 I am at Harvard presenting media\nmatters to David Hiesman^ seminar. I am looking forward\nto meeting Gordon Wilson of MIT at that time who has just\ngot nine million from Ford for Systems Development.\nI have seriously in mind the future of media study as\nbelonging somewhere in such a project. Is it not\nridiculous that people like Norbert Wiener having begun\ncommunications study under electronic auspices should\nhave tumbled Into the subliminal pockets of Gutenberg\ntechnology?

Gestalts have\nno content.\nVery exciting work remains to be done on the play\na^*earning P°ssJkmties resulting from the deliberate\n°f ??? medium within another medium.
