Skornia\nExecutive Director NAEB\nlit Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nThanks for the draft of the McLuhan project. Both copies\nwere the same, but it’s characteristic of your thoroughness to be\nsure I received the second draft.\nYou’ve obviously done an excellent job of translating McLuhan\ninto intelligible terms—no easy task.’\nSISfo'uYS\nAHf\nJAN 26 1959\ni\nThe only part I’m doubtful about is Section V, where refer¬\nence is made to the influence of the telegraph on the press. Frank\nByrne, one of our bright young men in the history department, did\na great deal of work in nineteenth-century newspapers for his\ndoctoral dissertation. He greatly questions Marshall’s generaliza¬\ntions about the influence of the telegraph on press format and the\nnature of reporting. Frank's pointed questions (I did not hear\nthem myself) apparently got under Marshall's skin because he asked\nme afterward who the young man was. Perhaps you’ll want to make\nat least a mental note to see that that part of the work is checked\nover. Probably I could get Frank to do it for one. Another good £tJ*\nman would be Ben Yablonsky of the NYU School of Journalism. Then\nthere is the whole stable of journalism personnel right there in\nGregory HallJ\nIt was good to see you again in Minneanolis. I’m sorry you\nwere in such a hurry at the airport that I didn't have time to\nintroduce you to my brother and his wonderful family.\nSincerely,\n(j^ v C , L(J\nP. C. Williams, S.
