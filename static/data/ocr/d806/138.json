Griffiths nad eoen\nand bringing him up to the end of the convention which he had net witnessed©\nThe meeting of the Advisory Committee with the President of the Center,\nNovember 12, was almost completely negative® Very few subjects of any importance\nwhatever came up for discussion, little information was exchanged either way,\nand no agreements arrived at® This may bo the first sign of a changed attitude\nof the FAE « Center crowd toward us and a direct reflection of the reaction\nGriffiths got at Norman® Apparently my letter did nothing to restore tiie balance®\nI certainly agree with you that we must keep a positive approach® I also\nagree with you that tho Norman meeting was very healthy for the total membership®\nAny negative reactions picked up by outsiders at the meeting are unfortunate\nby-products arid we shall simply have to do what m can to correct them®\nWe will have further opportunity to guage the effect of the Norman meeting\nand the impact of our discussion at the recent meeting of the Advisory Committee\nwith the Center Presidant when our current requests to FAE and otu* forthcoming\nrequests to the Center for production funds com up for decision from those two\ngroups®\nThe only point of conflict wMsh arose* at the meeting with Kr® Ns^um was\na discussion of tho advisability of NAEB's doing any more productions, either\nradio or TV, such m the nBig Four**® % proposed that, being m organization\ncomposed of producers and having attracted considerable attention to educational\nbroadcasting through these productions, NAEB should continue, on a limited scale\nperhaps, this kind of production. Ve suggested that the \"Big Four” wore succeas-\nful in Dart because they represented a sort of pooling of abilities on a produc¬\ntion-supervision level® Further, they had & greater guarantee of success because\nthe organisation as a whole felt considerable pride in the production and, there¬\nfore, was more interested in seeing to it that the shows were successful than\nwould have been true had the programs boon dona by some other agency or group\nor an individual staff®"
