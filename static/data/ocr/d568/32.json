  "text": "THE PRESENT SITUATION IN EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION\nNO WORKING DEFINITIONS\nOne of the greatest difficulties in attempting to evaluate the present situ¬\nation in educational television is the apparent fact that no common set of\ngoals exists o There is no single clear-cut concept of what constitutes a\ngood educational television station operation, or how many such operations\nshould exist, or even what they should do when and if they do exist.\nApparently the only two words in this field which have common acceptance\nare \"educational” and \"television\".\nOn the word \"television\" there appears to be the least confusion* Nearly\neveryone is prepared to admit that the word describes a process whereby\nsound and sight is electronically broadcast through the air*\nOn the word \"education\" there is a great deal of confusion* In the United\nStates this is a very broad term which covers a multitude of virtues and\nsins*\nObviously \"education\" as used in context with television is a virtue word*\nIt is a banner under which we can rally, and it is generally acceptable as a\ngood aid supportable thing for the same reasons as are \"truth\", \"beauty\" and\n\"justice\"*\nBecause of this fact, there has been a great deal of difficulty in attempting\nto define what an educational station should do* During the period of organi¬\nzation, fund-raising and drum beating boards of education, civic-minded\ncitizens, professional educators, etc* could all support the idea of \"edu¬\ncational television\"* When the situation began to particularize and deadlines\nbegan to rear their ugly heads, one could find a multitude of ideas about the\nimplementation of the project* To one supporter this meant Shakespearean\ndrama, to another illustrated lectures in algebra, to another \"great books\",\nto another \"forums\", to another \"nothing popular\", to another \"in-school\nsupplementation\", and to another \"high standards\" and only \"good programs\"*\nThis sort of confusion is familiar enough to any sociologist or social psychol¬\nogist, but left undefined is likely to result in complete and hopeless con¬\nfusion in the development of educational television* Success and failure\ncannot be measured or even defined for measurement and the statement of a\nprogram policy becomes merely an exercise in rhetoric in the absence of a\ndefinition*\nWebster’s Dictionary does net offer a great deal of help nor do several book¬\nshelves of texts on the subject of either education or television in reaching\na universally acceptable definition—nor would one expect them to*\nA SUGGESTED APPRAISAL\nA glance at Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary iB useful, however, and I quote\npage 818 .."
