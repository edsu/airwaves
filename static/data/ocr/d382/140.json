I*ve included some of his\nwith others and submit the following for reaction.\nOn an interim basis for either a full year or (as Frank also suggests) a six months basis\n(which would put us on the same calendar year basis as the Center and JCET), we might\nget by with renewal of:\nEngineering Services $30,000.00\nManagement Consultation Service 4,000 • 00\nSeminars and Workshops (run by NAEB) 24,000.00\nPlacement (as at present only) 5,000.00\nFellowships and Scholarships 10,000.00\nGrants-in-Aid for ETV Workshops 18,909.00\n$91,000.00\nThese are all renewals. We should request permission to revamp and liberalise scholar¬\nships, since funds are not moving on the present pittance (up to $300.00 or so) basis.\nRather than list Consultant Services renewal at $6,000.00 since these funds aren't\nmoving much either, except as stop-gap for our hoped for activation project, I suggest\nwe request\nActivation and Consultation $59.000.00: This needs to be big enough to enable setting\nup the structure and mechanics. Otherwise it will limp along and die. It deserves tak¬\ning a stand on.\nI'd also seriously hope a couple of other projects, too seriously needed to watt for an\ninterim period to pass, should have some progress. I recommend requesting:\nFor Research (on essentially the same basis that we now have Bidlack and Engineering),\nProgram Director, and Equipment on a stop-gap interim (experimental) basis:"
