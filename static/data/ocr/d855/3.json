Might look at floor plants,\nif and as we progress.\n2} Brown Shingle across from ice-rink* Looks a little small but\ndidnâ€™t measure off.\nFire - danger. Good location. Rather unlikely, but second choice\nof the three. Loading facilities? Heating? Floor space?\n3) The Goodwin Ave. Brick (second N. of Trinity Methodist) looks\nvery good, but seems much too small (without measuring or having\ndimensions). Is it over 20 x 25, which would be about our present\nspace?"
