It was often neces¬\nsary for individuals to speak in our name under the pressure of\ntime and necessity. Jll credit to them for the resultsi It wil\nbe to the benefit of foundations if our organizational structure\nis streamlined to meet the burden their gifts have imposed.\n20 The second great area of weakness is in the Regions themselves\nThere is a big gap, communication wise, between the Regional Directors\nand the member stations. John Dunn put his finger on this weak spot in\nhis recent circular. Regular regional meetings (at least yearly) are\nthe partial answer here, I believe, in addition to the particular\ngenius of the Director in keeping in touch with the membership. There\nis also an apathy in the membership (they are busy in tljieir own opera¬\ntions*). Confession being, * tis said, good for the soul, let me per¬\nsonally admit to object failure to do a job in this regard in Region I.\nOPERATION \"CLARITY\" (See Schematic B)\nThere are three main elements to Operation \"Clarity\";\n1- NAEB Board (also read Foundation Board)\n2- Headquarters (add Executive Director)\n3- Regional Meetings\nIn more detail;\nA. The Board becomes the high-level policy making organ of the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters. In reference to the\nExecutive Director and Headquarters this should take the form of num¬\nbered and dated policy directives. These policy directives may be as\nbroad or as specific as the situation calls for. In a case where too\nminute a directive would hamper operations a broad directive with cer¬\ntain definite limits would do. Within the framework of the limits."
