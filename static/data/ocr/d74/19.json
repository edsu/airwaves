  "text": "A SURVEY OF THE NEEDS OF EDUCATION\nFOR TELEVISION SPECTRUM SPACE\nThis is important to you, and to everyone in the field of education in\nthe United States.\nThe Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission has called\nupon education to document the needs of education for television spectrum\nspace. He has indicated that unless such evidence is available in the forth¬\ncoming allocation proceedings, education might be seriously slighted in the\nnew assignments, and might be permanently deprived of its present reserva¬\ntions.\nApproximately 10 years ago the educational community, in a joint effort,\npersuaded the FCC to set aside a portion of the established television spectrum\nfor the general use of education.\nAt that time few among us could begin to envision the potential need of\ntelevision frequencies for educational purposes. Our demands for spectrum\nreservations were based mainly upon optimism and experimental fervor; but\nno one really knew what our needs were, or would be, for television frequencies.\nDuring these ten years the development of the use of television, in all its\nphases, for education has been impressive, and the obvious potential use and\nneed has grown beyond anything dreamed of when the original allocations were\nmade. In spite of this, we, as an educational community within the nation, still\nhave much to learn about our real as well as our projected needs for television0\nWe must know much more about how such needs could or should be met.\nFailure to acquire such knowledge would be, to say the least, dangerous to the\nfull development of television for education.\nThe FCC has stated that the matter of television allocations is its number\none problem, despite the fact that the Commission and Congressional Committees\nhave been working on it for the past five years."
