  "text": "February 2, 1956\nMr. William G. Harley\nRadio Station WHA\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nAs Holt ha© summarised the Redfield tapes:\nTapes were sent to the Acceptance Subcommittee in April. In May, they were\nrejected two to one. Summary of reactions: Bo, introduction too long, re¬\ncording quite poor, subject matter too specialised. \"les. Urbane, provoking,\nthoughtful.\" \"No. Too wordy and too dull.\" Letter of rejection sent to\nBlakely by HJS.\nJune, in a confidential letter at request of Skoraia (who said \"dan»it guys,\nbe realistic\") Holt asks the subcommittee to reconsider its votes and offers\nto send tapes again. One of the eonmittee asked for tapes again, and they\nwere sent to &LL aembers.\nReactions came in in September and October (presumably after vacations).\nAgain, the vote was two to on© against distribution, and the one \"yes\" vote\nwas rather reluctant in tone.\nIn October HJS again wrote to Blakely, giving the decision, some of the\nreasons for it, and quoting a suraary of standards drawn up some time before\nby the Network Committee chairman.\nMost of the comments by the committeemen are in the files. Tapes of these,\nplus Bryson Lectures which were distributed, ware returned to Blakely in\nthe fall. Latter was convinced the Acceptance Committee and/or standards\nwere wrong. Skornia mumbled something about \"democracy,\" and \"it all depends\non the make-up of the Committee,\" etc.\nConn&ttee meetings and others a mile a minute. Lots of 'em on week-ends.\nGreat strides. Late hours. Groggy staff. Voices raised in the backroom.\nGiving Schooley copy of your interest in fulfilling your duties to BARB, as\nwell as of this, my reply."
