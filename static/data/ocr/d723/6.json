Rainier, Maryland\nDear Mr. Eidlins\nIn reply to your request of February 23, I am sending under separate\ncover some materials which will give you an idea of the purposes and\nfunctions of the NAEB.\nThe NAEB is composed of three types of membership. Active membership\nis open to educational and public service institutions owning and op¬\nerating their own educational radio and/or television stations. Asso¬\nciate membership is open to such institutions who do not operate stations\nbut who do have production centers and regularly produce educational pro¬\ngrams over some other outlet* Affiliate membership is open to ary or¬\nganization or individual interested in the general furtherance of edu¬\ncational broadcasting.\nThe annual dues for Affiliate membership are $10, including a subscrip¬\ntion to our monthly Newsletter, back copies of which are included in the\nmaterials being sentT In addition. Affiliate members receive some of\nthe other reports, surveys, etc. which we publish from time to time,\nalthough they do not receive all the materials normally sent to Active\nand Associate members* In addition. Affiliate members have the privi¬\nlege of attending our various meetings and conventions, and thus get an\nopportunity to meet and discuss educational broadcasting with persons\nactive in the field* For your convenience I am enclosing a membership\napplication blank, and would welcome any further questions you might have\nabout the Association after you have had an opportunity to look over the\nmaterials I am sending.\nSincerely,\nHEHrcr\nEnclosures\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director"
