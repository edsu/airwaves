Salley\nLouisville Free Public Library\nStation WTPL-FM\nLouisville, Kentucky\nDear Mr. Salley:\n1 was delighted to get a copy of your note to Frank Schooley\nconcerning the new International Exchange programs which\nwe have been able to obtain from the French Broadcasting\nSyste\nI need not indicate to you that I was somewhat astonished\nand shocked that after the Board of Directors of NAJEB\nenthusiastically approved the distribution of this series,\nthat it was found necessary to go through the folderol of\ncanvassing the Program Acceptance Committee to decide\nwhether or not the programs should even be offered to the\nNetwork stations. 1 have long believed that the individual\nstation managers should have the last word on accepting or\ndeclining the programs. To maintain a bottleneck at the\nheadquarters operation before even making an offering is\nshortsighted policy indeed.\nFor your support of what I believe to be a tremendously\nexciting new venture, please believe that I am deeply grateful.\nCordially yours\nens - Ig\nSeymour N* Siegel\nDirector"
