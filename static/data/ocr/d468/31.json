We are touring your whole country*\nThe finest country in the world*\nI am sure it is. Goodbye, sir.\nGoodbye2 sir.\nGoodbye,.gentlemen; and remember that little American story! (GOING)\nI think he is right; that is an American story. A poor boy rising to be\na large property owner, enjoying the respect of his community.\nBut chiefly because of his money.\nEven so, already we have heard a great deal of talk of money, of\nmaking it and of getting it. Perhaps that is why. Perhaps it is the\nsymbol of position; as blood is with us.\nPerhaps so. Forgive my inattention.\nYou are perhaps reading in the book of Nature; observing the crowds\nas they hurry to and fro?\nI was observing the people, yes. But it's not the ones that are here\nthat interest me, so much as the ones that are missing.\nThe ones that are missing, Beaumont? Explain yourself.\nThere are almost no children to be seen; and no soldiers.\nNo children and no soldiers; I believe you are right.\nIf we had walked this far in a French city, we should have seen hundreds\nof children and dozens of soldiers. Now where are they?\nI have no idea: but it will give us something to ask Governor Throop.\nON TO GOVERNOR THROOP\nWell, here is the Governor1s residence.\nA boarding house exactly like our own. Knock on the door."
