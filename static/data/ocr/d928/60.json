I'm not sure.)\nWASHINGTON REPORT will continue without interruption with John\nLewis handling it at least until September 1, After thattthe situa¬\ntion might be reexamined.\nSPECIALS will continue to flow from Washington, Betty Mclivane\nwill handle this.\nA final observation about specials: 1 think the injection of this\nkind of immediate. Important report by a major figure speaking\nmeaningfully on a major them® is the best single way to give net¬\nwork programming a sens© of vitality. It is every NAEV station\nsitting on top of significant national international affairs. It is\nevery NAEB station reporting from the nation's capital whenever\nthere is something to report.\nThis is to suggest that in addition to, and aside from, SPECIAL OF\nTBE WEEK, really significant specials from Washington (OR else-\nwherekbe distributed in such length as will do the material, rather\nthan the schedule, the most good.\nI think our stations should be prepared to interrupt or re-arrange\ntheir scheduling if there is a truly revealing repeat, or series of\nrepots, which, as a coherent unit, will run longer than a weekly\nhalf hour."
