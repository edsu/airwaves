Prior to coming to WUFT in 1963,\nhe was a free-lance writer and producer for TV, and had been\ndirector of special projects for WQED, Pittsburgh.\n^ Robert A. Mott is the new chairman of the Washington\nState University communications department, replacing Allen\nMiller who resigned and went on a sabbatical leave to Eu¬\nrope April 1. Miller will continue as director of information\nservices and professor of communications when he returns\nin September. Mott joined the WSU staff in 1956 as news\ndirector of the radio station; since 1962 he has been radio-TV\nservices manager.\n^ James Etheridge, Jr., executive secretary of the Florida\nETV Commission since its inception in 1957, has resigned to\nenter private business. William W. Galbreath has been ap¬\npointed to the post.\n^ Frank R. Jamison, director of ETV at Colorado State\nCollege, has been appointed broadcasting consultant to the\nWyoming Fish and Game Commission. He will conduct a\nworkshop and help evaluate a weekly radio and TV series.\n^ Lawrence M. damage, director of TV for Wayne State\nUniversity, was one of five recipients of a 1965 award from\nthe Detroit American Women in Radio and TV. The awards\nare for outstanding initiative, creativity, and responsibility.\n^ William J. Hanford, of the Wayne State University hu¬\nmanities department, has been appointed director of Dela¬\nware’s newly established ETV network. He will assume his\nnew position July 1, after completing his Ph.D. in mass com¬\nmunications.\n^ Mrs. Elizabeth Marshall has been appointed director of\nradio-TV for the Chicago Board of Education.\n^ Keith Engar has left his position as director of radio-TV\nservices at the University of Utah to become chairman of the\ndepartment of theatre and ballet and executive director of the\nPioneer Memorial Theater. Rex Campbell, formerly assistant\ndirector of radio-TV services, succeeds him.\nSTATE\n^ Recent action in the Texas Legislature brings state sup¬\nport for ETV closer. Identical bills in the state Senate and\nHouse were unanimously voted to the floor, without being\nsent to subcommittee; this amounts to a suspension of the\nrules requiring all bills to go to subcommittee. The bill would\nallow money being spent by local school districts for ETV\nservices from ETV stations to be matched up to 75c per\npupil in average daily attendance.\n^ In New York, it looks as if the plan for a state-wide ETV\nnetwork may suffer a setback if the $625,000 for the first\nleg of the network has to be cut from the governor’s budget.\nMAY 1965\n3"
