It would seem to me that this belongs in\nm introduction to be written by someone else© Inasmuch as George\nis to write an introduction, he ought to either include the statement\non page 16, or not, as he sees fito X am glad that you agree that\nit bo omitted from its present position©\nI am happy, also, that you have no objection to the suggested re-®\narrangement of the contents, and I hope you will proceed to rearrange\nthem for the printer©\nInsofar as point 5 is concerned, I agree with you that the sentence\net the bottom of page $6 might well be deleted© I am glad, also,\nthat you are prepared to delete the phrase \"of minor importance\",\nand let stand the stateiaent that the monitors were not trained to\nmake this decision©\nInsofar as point 4 is concerned, apparently there was a typo in my\nletter to you, and you are perfectly right in saying that this point\ndoesn't male© sense© My original intent was to ask you whether there\nwas not some convenient breaking point in the 38 pages between page\n20 and page 58, at which the present chapter 2 might be split into\ntoo chapters© This suggestion is based solely on the desire to\nimprove readability©"
