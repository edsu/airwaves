But he must\ndepend on that Monarchist support in part because the Social Democrats\n— who are doing some of the criticizing — withheld their 19 Chamber\nvotes from Pella when his government was constituted.\nIt Is a sad political fact that the parties of the Center and\nmoderate Left — the pro-western parties that made up the former\nBe Gasperi coalition — simply didn't get enough votes last June 7.\nSo, Pella for the time being must depend on the Monarchists. That may\naccount in part for his caution and for his desire to keep his\ngovernment as non-political as possible.\nAnd even his critics concede that the country would be in a\ngenuine political crisis if Pella were to fall in the near future.\nThat helps account for the duration of his political honeymoon with\nall parties. Including even those of the far Left.\nBut that honeymoon now seems to be drawing to a close. Pella\nstill seems to be very strong with the country. But political sniping\nhas begun in parliament, where the fate of the new government will be\ndecided.\nThe Communists and Left Socialists, who once praised Pella for\nsounding what they called a \"new tone of national dignity,\" have\ndiscovered that the whole thing Is not so new after all.\nmore"
