But today.we see a beginning\nwith television and radio materials that provide a sense of history,\nidentification and pride in background for the Afro-American. There\nhave been not only network programs such as \"Of Black America,\" but\nlocal programs, by commercial stations and in large part by educa¬\ntional stations, that not only provide a sense of positive identi¬\nfication, but provide, in many instances., the opportunity for the\npeople of the black ghetto to do their own thing by determining the\ncontent, by presenting, and by participating in the programs.\nI suggested last year that if television, through its typical\nentertainment programs, continued to show the ghetto man, v?oman and\nchild the material delights of the suburban promised land, did it\nnot seem logical that television should go on from there and show\nthem how to reach that land. Last year virtually nothing was being\ndone. Today efforts are being made to provide information and\neducational programs oriented to the special needs and desires of\nthe ghetto community.\nBut some areas have not progressed so well.\nFor example, when I use the term ghetto, 1 do not limit our\nconcerns to the black ghetto. I include the brown ghettos and the\nwhite slums and the other minority groups as well. We are saying\nand doing very little about these other groups, perhaps most\nobviously about the Spanish speaking ghettos of the north and the\nbarrios of the southwest.\nThis holds true for content approaches, too."
