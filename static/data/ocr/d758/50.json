Schooley\nDirector of Broadcasting\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Franks\nWell it looks like the number one griper on the Publications Committee\nwill have to go to work again. I think that our NAEB NEWSLETTER has\nshown a tremendous improvement during the past year and I would like\nto see it kept that way. For this reason, I cannot see the need of\na separate processed so-called \"Washington Report\". With the exception\nof the President’s Column, every other item in this insert could just\nas well be printed in the body of the NEWSLETTER and the result wuld\nbe a much better looking mailing.\nAs for the President’s Column, I have sounded off on that matter be¬\nfore and see no reason to change the present \"Column\". With due\nrespect to our President, it strikes me as utterly superfluous, wordy,\nand windy. If it is necessary to run something like this to maintain\nspirit in our organization then we had better set a committee at work\ndeveloping an NAEB pep song and a few appropriate yells.\nGetting a little serious about the \"Column\" I object to, after all it\nis being mailed largely to people who are already NAEB members. These\npersons certainly know already why they joined and perhaps they had\nother reasons which are perfectly valid but that is beside the point.\nI just want to keep us looking like professionals.\nElmer G. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGS:sd\ncc: Betty McKenzie"
