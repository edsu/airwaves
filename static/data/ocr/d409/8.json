Belmont, of course, expressed the view that an al¬\nliance would be an extremely desirable step from the point of view\nof both organizations.\nLyle, as I told you, is also much interested; hovrever, he did point\nout that a number of matters will have to be considered. For\nexample, present NEA bylaws require that any national organization\nrequesting departmental status shall have at least 250 members.\nIt is possible that the revision of the bylaws which is currently\ntaking place could include provision for organizations that have\ninstitutional members, as well individual members. However, that\nis a matter which will come up only after there is some formal\nindication by NAEB that you are interested in discussing the mat¬\nter of possible departmental status. Gan you send me a note in\nwhich you list very briefly the number of institutional, associate,\nand affiliate members you now have?\nWALTER A. WITTICH\nDirector, Bureau of Visual Instruction,\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nNational Staff\nj. j. McPherson\nExecutive Secretary\nANNA L. HYER\nAssistant Secretary\nIn the case of institutional members, would you be willing to\nhazard a guess as to the number of professional employees at\ninstitutions having membership in NAEB?—professional employees\nconcerned with the radio-TV work of the institution, that is.\nIf you come to Washington anytime soon, be sure to drop by for\na chat and possibly lunch.\nFLORENCE IH-CHI FAN\nAdministrative Assistant\nMARY C.
