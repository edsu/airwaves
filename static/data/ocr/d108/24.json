I would\nsend him those forms if I were you. He won’t advance any name to\na possible employer unless he can supply the details, and of course\nan inquiry about candidates for a job might come in \"any minute\nnow\". The salary range is very wide, incidentally! $3600 to $7800,\ngenerally according to the siae of the operation. Sorry that I\ndon’t know what the average or the mean is*\nHad a very pleasant time that Friday evening. Hope we may do it\nagain some time.\nSincerely,\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager\nJHfjy"
