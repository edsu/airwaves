Colman J.

As I understand, this is contingent upon the\nenactment of the Public Television Act of 1967.\nI am most happy to learn of your extensive efforts in\nthe field of educational radio, and I am well aware of not only\nthe contributions of this avenue, but also its tremendous poten¬\ntial. Therefore, in an effort to make your excellent views known\nto the Federal Communications Commission and also to the Chairmen\nof the respective Commerce Committees of the Congress, I am send-^\ning a copy of your letter to all three.\nAs soon as I receive a reply, I will write you further.\nIn the meantime I am enclosing a copy of a notification which\njust came in today from the FCC regarding educational FM channels.\nSincerely yours^\n/ ALBERT Ti, l^Ui\nL-^Member of Congress\nAHQ/mc\n."
