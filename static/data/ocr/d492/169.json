SEVENTEEN SLAVES WERE PUT TO\nTRIAL AND HANGED .\nMUSIC:\nSTINGER\n,NNCR :\nThis excerpt from Langston Hughes recording the The\nGlory of Negro History sets the scene for today’s dis-\ncuss i on of '’The Last Citizen”—Protest’.\nMUSIC:\nSTINGER\nvNNCR :\nThe L^st Citizen: The Negro in Am erica., -a series of\nPROGRAMS DEVOTED TO THE EXTENSION OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF\nTHE LARGEST MINORITY GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES, ITS\nPROBLEMS, AND THE PROBLEMS IT POSES TO ALL AMERICANS.\nThe Last Citizen is produced by Radio Station\nPurdue University, uner a grant from the Educational\nTelevision and Radio Center, in cooperation with the\nNational association of Educational Broadcasters.
