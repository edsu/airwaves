Hill,\nN.A.E.B.\n14 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nJanuary 4th,\nJAN 1 4 I960\nI960.\nreceived\nnaeb HEADQUARTERS\nDear Harold:\nC:\nA very Happy New Year to you and your family.\nAs for iqyself, I managed to spend most of the\nChristmas vacation travelling. I don*t see how Hariy\nSkomia manages to endure that life. He deserves\nto have a t.v. circuit which would enable,.him to\ndo his interviewing from an easy chair. ]\nEnclosed are some accounts which have accum¬\nulated over the months. The basic problem relating\nto them is that they must be paid in Canadian funds.\nBut the rate of exchange varies from to and\neven 6%. Let us make it 5£, so that if the rate\nhappens to be above that when they receive payment\nthey can add it to the next bill.\nIf it will save you ary bother, I will be\nglad to send the cheque and invoice to the companies\nnyself if you wish to forward them to me.\nSome of the invoices may seem out of line and\nexorbitant. This is owing to the initial rental in¬\ncluding an additional amount which does not occur\nin the subsequent invoices.\nAm hoping to get down to Urbana before long.\nVery best wishes.\nH. M. Me Luhan/RN\nEnclosures.\nMr. Hill: I*m waiting for statements\nfrom Walsh & Ross (re typewriter) and\nOffice Equipment (re photocopying\nmachine). Will send them on to you\nas soon as received. We owe for\n3 or 4 months, but with the exception\nof $25.75 (photocopying machine) which\nProf. McLuhan paid, we still must be\nbilled. Sincerely, .\n—>-'t"
