I found it quite interesting—as\nyou say, in view of our struggles with the PR\nkit for NAEB. Those are going fairly well, by\nthe way. Over half of them have been mailed\nto people who requested them...and quite a\nsizeable number of the Speaker's Portfolio\nalso. I plan to run an up-to-date item on them\ndin the March Newsletter.\n1 We were successful in getting free space for\none major exhibit—the ASCD hhkxxh convention\nI in St. Louis in March. Marguerite Fleming is\n/ handling all the exhibit, and plans to have\n) staff members to man it.\nWonder if I'll see you at the Region III meet\nin Chicago next month? If so, maybe we can talk\nabout what project we should work on this year\nPR-wise. There are a number of things—ques¬\ntions, that is—I can think of: How can we do\nan NAEB PR job in connection with the State\nETV committees etc. springing up to takead-\nvantage of national funds? Are our publications\ndoing an adequate PR job and how could they\ndo better? (Here I'm referring to the Journal\nand Newsletter primarily.) Perhaps we could"
