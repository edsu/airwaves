Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nNAEB\n111 Gregory Hall\n4\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harold:\nPlease note the enclosed letter from Petry which I would like re¬\nturned. I would like to heartily endorse Tom’s suggestion and ex¬\npress the further hope that Tom be given this appointment. Let me\nknow what you do so I can keep my records straight.\nMarion Corwell and I have been most enthusiastic about a project I\nwant our committee to undertake^ and that is the preparation of an\nattractive SPEAKER’S GUIDE similar to that issued by the NAB for\nradio. Since you are in Washington, you should be able to bum a\ncopy off the Nab boys, but if you get frustrated I will send you\none of my extra copies.\nThis projected SPEAKER’S GUIDE not only will make it easy for our\nmembership to get up on short notice and deliver a dozen authori¬\ntative talks on the NAEB, but the material in the GUIDE will also\nprovide the essentials for local news stories and local program\nschedules that our people may wish to get out.\nSure, it will be expensive, but it will serve so many purposes that\nI think it will be a good investment. If you agree, try to get\nthis authorized so that our committee can come up with the proper\ncopy before we get bumped out of office.\nWhenever you and Dorothy happen to be passing through God’s country,\nDorotha and I insist on your paying us a visit. Otherwise, I with¬\ndraw ray membership 1\nLrector\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGS:vz\ncc: Mrs. Betty McKenzie"
