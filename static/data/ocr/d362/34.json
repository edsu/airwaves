The recent NAEB seminar on the\nInstructional Uses of Television and Radio brought together,\nfor the first time, those responsible for planning in-school\nprograms and representatives of teacher-training institutions\nresponsible for teaching of methods courses to future teachers.\nThose in attendance at this seminar were unanimous in the opinion\nthat the NAEB should conduct seminars on utilization at the\nregional and local level. The MARS feels that such seminars\nand workshops are essential if educational television and\nradio are to be utilized to their fullest extent in the classroom.\n4 - If a three-year professional advancement program is set up,\nmuch of the time and energy of the Headquarters staff should be\ndevoted to planning and carrying it out. It Is not felt\neconomical to hire someone new to coordinate these activities,\nespecially in view of the difficulty of hiring a top-flight\nman on a short-term basis. Additional secretarial help would\nhave to be added for short periods. If such a project can be\nfinanced, a reduction in the Headquarters operational budget\nmight be possible since a portion of certain salaries could be\npaid out of the professional advancement funds. For utilization\nseminars and workshops it Is anticipated that educational conÂ¬\nsultants would be engaged to help plan and carry than out.\nHowever this would not be a regular, full-time staff addition.\nRather it would be someone of the caliber of Hr. Wells Foshay,\nto whom a retainer would be paid."
