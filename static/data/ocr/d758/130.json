Perhaps our questionnaire wasn’t well\nworded or something, but we received 18 replies. Of course we\ndistributed it at the 1959 convention rather than mailing to Journal\nrecipients. Bor your info, I’m enclosing a copy with the results\ntabulated on it. I’d like it back, as it’s the only one I have.\nIt may well be that there’s more interest in the Journal now than\nthere was than (it’s certainly easier to get artlcleat) «nd_ that\ntherefore we*d have better success• If you think it worthwhile, X li\nbe happy to see What we can do. Unless we took a page of the Journal\nto print it on, 1 don’t think we could mail it with tha Journal because\nof the second-class permit restrictions. Perhaps we could try, again,\ndistributing them at tha Philadelphia convention?\nCordially,\n(Mrs.) Betty NeiCensle\nPublications Editor\nBMC/dp\nenclosure\njU'\n■"
