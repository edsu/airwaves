Pre-emptions have been reduced substantially in the\npast ten days and presuming the present circumstances\ncontinue, the situation looks good.\n2. The stations agree that either this situation must remain\nin this improved condition or it should be abandoned.\n3. We endorsed a priority that all stations in the country\nas soon as reasonable should be connected - thereby\nadding the dozen or so stations not now interconnected,\nand putting lines in to those dozen or so additionally that\nare now taking programs off the air.\n4. In order to look at the full system, we proposed, we must\nhave the AT&T proposal due to the FCC and us last November\n15th and not yet released by AT&T. We will continue to seek\nit.\n5. Our immediate objectives are these:\na. Maintenance of the current system, including\noutstanding national programming, 4, 5 nights."
