HARLEY\nPRESIDENT\nMay 28, 1963\nMr. Lou Peneguy\nDirector, Coordination and Information\nAlabama Educational Television Commission\n2151 Highland Avenue\nBirmingham 3, Alabama\nDear Lou;\nI agree with you that there has often been too little time\nfor committee members to become sufficiently acquainted with\ntheir responsibilities before their term of office expires.\nThis was the reason that we inaugurated the plan for three\nyear staggered terms with three members revolving off each\nyear. Appointments are made in January and are for the\ncalendar year.\nSince you did not have a full three year term ami since\nyou were a valuable member while you were on the Committee,\nwould you be willing to accept a vice appointment for the\nbalance of this year to the Public Relations Committee?\nFrances Butler, AAtlW, has had a change in her responsibilities\nand has resigned from the Committee. I should like to appoint\nyou to fill out the balance of her term.\nWilliam 0. Harley\nPresident\nWGH/mlm /\ncc; Marion Corwell"
