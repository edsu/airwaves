  "text": "'This Is the NAEB Tape Network”\nMany times each week listeners to WOSU hear the familiar words, “This is the\nNAEB Tape Network.” It occurred to us that readers of the Bulletin might\nlike to know more about the NAEB, its organization, its purpose, and its coopera¬\ntive network. And so, with that thought\nmonth to the NAEB story.\nThe NAEB Tape Network is a co¬\noperative organization devoted to the\ndissemination of outstanding radio pro¬\ngrams. This network is operated by the\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters for its member stations, sta¬\ntions which are owned by educational\ninstitutions, municipalities, and other\npublic service agencies. It provides for\nthe mutual exchange of the best pro¬\ngrams of its member stations and se¬\ncures and distributes programs from\nother agencies (such as the British\nBroadcasting Corporation and the French\nBroadcasting Corporation) engaged in\nthe production of radio programs of\nserious purpose and mature content.\nThe NAEB Tape Network actually\ncame into being in January, 1950 when\nMr. Seymour N. Siegel, manager of\nNew York City’s municipal station\nWNYC, offered to a group of stations a\ntape recorded program titled, We\nHuman Beings. The idea had an amaz¬\ning growth. Under the guidance of the\nWNYC staff, the idea grew from just a\ndream to an exchange service supplying\n35 stations. When finally, however, the\nproblems of finances, personnel, and\ntime became too great for the WNYC\nstaff alone, the Division of Communica¬\ntions of the University of Illinois offered\nto assume custodianship of the network.\nIn January of 1951, the headquarters for\nthe network were moved to the Uni¬\nversity of Illinois campus in Gregory\nHall, and, in the months that followed,\nthe network continued to grow until it\nnow numbers more than eighty affiliated\nstations in all parts of the country. Six\nstations in the state of Ohio are now\nmembers of the network: WBGU, the\nBowling Green State University; WBOE,\nthe station of the Cleveland Board of\nin mind, we are devoting this space this\nEducation; WKSU, the Kent State Uni¬\nversity; WMUB, Miami University;\nWOUI, Ohio University; and, of course,\nWOSU, the Ohio State University.\nThe NAEB Tape Network is based\nupon the belief that the use of radio\nonly for entertainment and the selling\nof merchandise is a serious waste of a\nmajor national resource. Radio broad¬\ncasting, the members of the NAEB be¬\nlieve, can also be used as an important\ninstrument in the dissemination of in¬\nformation, opinion, discussion, and in¬\nterpretation essential to the solving of\ntoday’s problems. Radio can also pro¬\nvide significant cultural experiences. The\nNAEB is dedicated to this sort of radio\nbroadcasting.\nThe sources of radio programs distri¬\nbuted by the NAEB are many. In ad¬\ndition to programs produced by member\nstations, to date the network has used\nseries produced by the British Broad¬\ncasting Corporation, the Canadian Broad¬\ncasting Corporation, the Cooper Union,\nWOSU PROGRAM BULLETIN\nVol. XVIII November, 1953 No. 3\nPublished monthly, October to August, inclusive, and\nsemi-monthly in September by The Ohio State University\nat Columbus.
