We are given special allocations when needed. For\nexample, this year we asked for $50.00 to purchase small\nitems in connection with TV experimentation; it was avail¬\nable. Last year we had a special allocation of $4,000.00\nfor two Collins consoles. We have just asked for space\nexpansion in the order of fifty per cent. It has been grant¬\ned arid we have been asked to draw up plans for the conver¬\nsion of said space.\nWe use three speech staff members in radio. The practice\nof the department is a teaching load of 12 hours per week\nwhere extra curricular activities are involved. One of the\nstaff members teaches 6 hours per week; the other two teach\n9 hours per week. Thus, in strict accounting these reduc¬\ntions of teaching loads probably should be counted as\nsalaries. We have never attempted to figure our budgets in\nthis way. The only wages appearing on our budgets ere re¬\npresented bv the two A-2 items above. Were we to attempt\nitemization of faculty salaries it. might appear in this\nform;\nAss 71 Prof. #1\n$2,400.00\nAss 7t Prof. #2\n1,400.00\nInstructor\n1,320.00"
