  "text": "From DES MOINES SUNDAY REGISTER, March 7, 1948\nFreedom for the New Communicatic\nA reader, commenting on our re¬\ncent editorial, “Radio Editorials Up\nFor Hearing Again,” raises a ques¬\ntion: “If and when radio facsimile\nnewspapers become common, what\nshould be the rule covering ex¬\npressions of editorial opinion?”\nThe question is an important\none. We said in our editorial that\nthe changing technology of com-\n. munication makes any conclusions\nabout freedom to editorialize by\nt radio tentative. Although we men¬\ntioned i only television, we might\nproperly have included both fre¬\nquency Modulated radio (FM) and\nfacsimile printing by radio.\n(A Qtport on the background of\nfederamllcensing of radio stations\nand cdhfrdl of program content, to¬\ngether •with some of the implica¬\ntion^ mf facsimile newspapers is\npresented, on this page today.)\n' It Unconceivable that the limited\nfreedom radio stations might be\nchanged ■ ,o complete; freedom—as\ncomplete j as the freedom of news¬\npapers—kfFM radio becomes gen-\nJ eral.\" iw transmission permits a\ngreat number of radio ^stations to\nbroadcast simultaneously without\ninterference. Government licensing\n, might become so free (like the sec¬\nond class mailing permit of a news¬\npaper) that it would be feasible to\nons.\nremove all restrictions on radio\nbroadcasts of opinion.\nThe same general conclusion may\nhold, also, for television. The limit¬\ned range of television may mean\nthat many more stations could be\nestablished _ all over the country_\nenough so that licensing would be¬\ncome free enough to permit edito¬\nrializing by station owners. On the\nother hand, television development\nmay take other directions; no one\ncan be sure.\nThe key to freedom for broad¬\ncasters to editorialize is freedom of\nentry into the business. That is\nthe reason why radio station edito-.\nrializing- is restricted now—because\nof the necessity for government li-\ncensing of the limited number of\nradio frequency channels available.\nFacsimile printing by radio raises\nstill more troublesome problems. Is\nit radio or is it printing? Since\nfacsimile will be transmitted by FM\nradio, the same conclusions prob¬\nably would hold for it as for FM\nsound broadcast.\nWe are entering into completely\nunexplored fields of communication\nat breakneck speed these days. It\nwill take level-headed statesman¬\nship to develop procedures consist¬\nent with our basic tenets of free¬\ndom of speech and freedom of the\npress."
