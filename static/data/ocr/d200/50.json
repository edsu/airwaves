Christiansen\nDirector of Television\nUniversity of Florida\n234 Stadium\nGainesville, Florida\nDear Ken:\nI don’t know what goes with Rosen, except the University of Illinois was also\ninterested in the possibility of employing him.\nI regret that the report of the Airlie House Seminar came as such a surprise.\nActually, it was discussed at some length in the TV Board meeting and in the meet¬\ning of the big Board at Columbus, which you did not attend.\nNevertheless, you are quite right that anything of this sort ought to be routinely\npassed along to the Directors. Accordingly, I am instructing Harold to see to it\nthat all communiques to Chairmen of Committees are automatically sent to members\nof the Board.\nThe Airlie House conference was a follow-up to the NAEB seminar in Madison.\nI felt that the final portion of Kellogg money set aside for seminars might properly\nbe devoted to assisting NAEB to assist itself. Consequently, I suggested that this\nbe largely a meeting of the Development Committee expanded by some members of\nthe Board and key Committee Chairmen, The main purpose was to review the recom¬\nmendations from last summer and then see what plans could be evolved for implementing\nthem.\nI look forward with interest to your comments on the report.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHipw"
