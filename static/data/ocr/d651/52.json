HAZLETT, Superintendent of Schools\n7 June, 1962\nMr. William G. Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Mr. Harley:\nOur staff has discussed at some length your memorandum of May 25th\nregarding experimental TV production by NAEB. The following questions\nresulted from our meetings:\n1. Why not refer groups interested in underwriting programs to NETRC?\n2. Does an interest by NAEB in quantity and quality improvement\nnecessarily mean that NAEB should enter the production business?\nMight this not deter potential underwriters away from NETRC, thus\nrestricting their financial capability to improve their service\nto ETV?\n3. Since NAEB is our spokesman for all educational broadcasting, won’t\ntheir value in this capacity be impaired if they undertake an\nendeavor which may be felt to be in competition with the interests\nof a segment of NAEB’s membership, namely the NET affiliate stations?\nIs it conceivable that this would bring about a rift in NAEB? NET\nis only a subscription service to us, whereas NAEB must serve as our\nunited spokesman. We cannot endanger NAEB’s role in this respect.\nWe feel that a clarification of purpose is needed\nZoel J. Parenteau\nDirector-Producer\nZP: 1 s\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nJUN 111962\nAM\nI"
