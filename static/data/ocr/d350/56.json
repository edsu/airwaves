Schooley\nTreasurer\nOffice of Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Schooley:\nYou asked me to give you my estimate of the ability of\nProfessor Earl Wynn.\nMr. Wynn developed both our Radio Department and our\nCommunication Center. They are growing, vital segments\nof the University because Earl Wynn has been such a very\ncapable Chairman of the Department and Director of the\nCenter. He is most enthusiastic about the educational\nvalue of radio and television and advocates their use as\ninstruments of teaching. A man of his vision would see,\nof course, the tremendous opportunities here, and he is\neager to meet the challenge.\nEarl Wynn has built a fine Department and Center here, a task\nthat would have been impossible to a man without outstanding\nadministrative ability and qualities of leadership. Personally,\nhe is out-going, refined, nice looking, has a magnificent voice,\nand likes people. He, in turn, has many friends in the Uni¬\nversity and the community.\nIf you interest Mr. Wynn in your Executive Directorship you\nwill get an excellent man, and, quite frankly, we will do our\nbest to keep him.\nChancellor"
