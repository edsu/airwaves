You have already been acquainted with this\nfact through the Cue Sheets, and on Wednesday, November 17, the first four\nprograms in the continuation of the series were put into the mail.\nWe would like to remind you of our procedure in the distribution of these\nprograms. We do not hold up the programs to distribute them one each week.\nThey usually arrive at the Network Headquarters four programs at a time,\nand Headquarters sends out copies of all four programs with the current\nweekly issue.\nWe strongly advise that on receipt those tapes be routed to your news\nchief for audition. Because of the constant flux of current events, he may\nfind it more effective to air the tapes in some other order than that in\nwhich they are numbered.\nFor instance, the first two programs in the continuation of Letter from\nItaly (series nos. 54-11-42 and 54-11-43) have to do with American Fulbright\nscholars in Italy. The second two programs (serial nos. 54-11-44 and\n54-11-/55) have to do with the current Italian political scene. Since polÂ¬\nitics are seldom stable, your news chief may wish to broadcast this second\npair of programs before the first, especially if, at the time you receive\nthem, there is some development in Italy on which he feels they may cast\nlight."
