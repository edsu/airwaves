Columns 2 and 3 indicate the\npercentage of respondents issuing and not issuing such schedules, respec¬\ntively. Of the stations putting out schedules, a number have them\nprocessed instead of printed, and column 4 indicates the percentage of\nthe schedules that are processed. For the purpose of this study,\nprocessed is defined as to mean all schedules that are produced in any way\nother than printed from type*\nTABLE 1\nPERCENTAGES OF RESPONDENTS ISSUING PROGRAM SCHEEULES AND PERCENTAGES\nOF SCHEDULES THAT ARE PROCESSED\n1\nClass of\nStation\n2\nStations\nIssuing\nSchedules\n3\nStations not\nIssuing\nSchedules\n5\nPercentages\nof Schedules\n\"Processed”\nI\n85+\n15-\n344*\nH\n95-\n5+\n72+\nIII\n100\n00\n27+\nIV\n100\n00\n50\nThe large number of processed schedules issued by the Class II stations\nis due, no doubt, to the fact that most of these stations perform a service\nfor in-school listening, where schedules must be issued on a weekly basis,\nand economy is a \"must.\"\nThere is little unanimity as to frequency of issuance of schedules.\nWhile a large number of the Class I stations publish monthly schedules,\nthere are a considerable number of adherents to weekly and every-other-\nmonth publication. Table II presents this information for each class of\nstation."
