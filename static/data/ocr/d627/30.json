Hill\nAdministrative Vico President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nHi Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbsna, Illinois\nDear Harold* *\nToday ray communicate to NAEB headquarters goes to you. Perhaps between\nthe letters I have written to you and Harry, all of your questions\nare answered. But in case they aren’t, I’ll try to summarize the\nsituation.\nW/*\nUfiS^Y\nThe draft proposal I sent in is only to be used as a starting point.\nTour suggestion of starting with a visit to headquarters coincides\nwith the suggestion in my January 13 letter. How does the February\n8 date suit you?\nAs far as the handling of phase 1 of the proposal, I will be very\nwilling and able to undertake the job of getting the project under\nway. As for the traveling expenses, I am sure the $1,000 you men¬\ntioned will be adequate for the first phase. If it is not enough to\ncomplete the job, it will certainly let us go a long way down the\nroad. If I plan an itinerary to visit several locations on one trip\nwe will get the most for our money.\nYou can see from the copy of the letter to Superintendent Willis we\nare trying to get at least one kit on the road. I contacted Eliazbeth\nMarshall about doing a kit and she suggested the approach to be made\nthrough her superintendent. I will let you know what results from\nthis letter. Incidentally, perhaps I should clear a policy point.\nI have been assuming that it was appropriate for me to go ahead and\nmake contacts and send letters in the name of NAEB in relation to\nthis project. It occurs to me that it might be better if these con¬\ntacts were made, at least initially, through your or Harry’s office.\nOn the one hand we ca%ave time and on the other it would mean\nmore coming from you than from me. I have gone ahead in this one\ncase but would like your thoughts on the matter for the future."
