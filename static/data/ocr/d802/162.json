Except for the title ana introduction\non the second program in the series, *8£x to Sixty,” I would have thought\nI was listening to a program discussing a nationwide educational problem*\nIf the personnel at IrfOX will revamp the series to give it more general\ninterest it will get my vote* Otherwise the vote is no*\nSincerely,\nUugn W* Mix, Director\nEducational Broadcasting Services\nHMK191"
