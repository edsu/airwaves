Miles\nGentlemen i\nIn the midst or preparing for the Airborne TV conference\nI TOOK VALUABLE TIME OUT TO PREPARE THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT'\nI THEN HELD IT OVER A SEEK OF VACATION BECAUSE I WANTED\nTO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER IT BEFORE SENDING IT ALONG TO YOU'\nIT NOW SEEMS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY TO SEND IT«\nI HOPE THAT AFTER READING IT YOU WILL JOIN MI IN THINKING\nTHAT WE NOW WEED DESPERATELY A PLAN THAT WILL ENABLE EVERY\nSTUDENT IN EVERY SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND EVERY ADULT TO\nHAVE AVAILABLE TV CHANNELS FOR EDUCATION'\nAirborne TV will help, but it won't do the whole uob.\nImproved and less expensive VTRs will help too, so will\nIMPROVED SUUPORT FOR TOTAL EDUCATION' BUY THESE AND MANY\nOTHERS ARE, IN THE MINDS Or MOST PEOPLE, TOTALLY UNRELATED'\nThey need form. How can a small school system use television?\nHow WILL TELEVISION AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THAT SCHOOL\nSYSTEM? Do we know enough TODAY to make a BLUEPRINT rOR\nSUCH A SCHOOL SYSTEM?\nThe MORE t THINK OF IT THE MORE I AM CONVINCED THAT WE, MORE\nTHAN LIKELY, ARE AT THE STAGE EDUCATIONAL RADIO HAD REACHED\nWHEN THE 1949 AlLERTON CONFERENCE WAS CALLED' CAN WE TODAY\nCALL A SIMILAR CONFERENCE? CAN IT PROVIDE AS INTELLIGENT\nAPPROACH TO TELEVISION SPECIFICALLY AS THE 1949 CONFERENCE\nDID TO EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING IN GENERAL? CAN WE MAKE SENSE\nOF AND GIVE DIRECTION TO THE NA£8, ETRC, CONTINENTAL CLASS¬\nROOM, Inc#, JCET, Ford's national program, Airborne Television,\nRCA-Columbia U's ITV Investigations, etc. etc.\nAnd most important of all, should NAEB provide the impetus\nTODAY FOR THE DRAFTING or A CHARTER FOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION'"
