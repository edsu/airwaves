Hodge, General Manager\nTrade Department\nHarcourt, Brace and World, Inc.\n757 Third Avenue\nNew York 17, New York\nDear Mr. Hodge:\nWe are requesting authorization from the Harcourt, Brace and World\nPublishing Company to use a poem by Carl Sandburg, \"A.E.F.'*, for\nwhich we understand you hold the copyright.\nPermission to use this material is being sought by the N.A.E.B. in\nconnection with an arrangement we have with the Voice of America to\ndevelop an English Through Poetry series. The 13 commentaries for these\nprograms are being written by Professor M. L. Rosenthal of New York\nUniversity. The Voice of America, in turn, working closely with Professor\nRosenthal, will produce 13 quarter-hour radio scripts on the basis of\nthese commentaries. The radio programs themselves are intended for broad¬\ncast to listeners overseas, and are being designed to appeal to the\nlisteners interest in poetry in the English langauge.\nIn each script the poem will be read in its entirety, and the listeners\nwill also be invited to read the lines aloud in appropriate units after\nthe radio speaker.\nPermission is sought both for the broadcast by the Xoice °£ America to\noverseas countires and for broadcast in countries where local radio\nstations may receive the taped programs through the United States Infor¬\nmation Agency. Permission is also sought for publication of the poems\nthat might be published in any given country (with the aid or supervision\nof U.S.I.A.,) and distributed free or at cost to radio listeners.\nPermission is also sought for eventual publication of the materials in a\nsimilar study booklet to be produced by U.S.I.A. for gratis distribution\nto overseas listeners who request such booklets.\nWe hope we will hear from you shortly and that authorization to use these\nmaterials in the manner which we have outlined will be forthcoming."
