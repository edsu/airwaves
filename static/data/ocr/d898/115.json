However, at this critical period, the need is\nfor maximum thrust toward a single effective national service.\nThis system must be national in scope reaching markets in major\npopulation centers on both the east and west coasts. The\nnetwork interconnection must be routed in such a way that\noptional stations can join the network of key affiliates with\nmaximum convenience and minimum cost. A third level of program\nservice, via tape delay, must be available to non-interconnected\nstations outside the technical parameters of the network.\nOther networks should be foreclosed for the present. Any\npublic radio network project developed in the near future\nshould provide three level service including key, optional\nand tape affiliates.\nThe number of key stations should be a matter for continued\ndiscussion. Five to eight stations (as proposed on page three\nof the document) seems inappropriate. A more realistic number\nof affiliates is ten (as listed in page 8 of the document).\nAssuming a willingness by licensees to participate can be\ngenerated, the value of the experiment would be enhanced by\nincreasing the number of key stations."
