We may call upon them individually\nfor special studies or analyses; or we may convene them as a panel. In a\ngeneral way, we will look to them for counsel predominantly in three areas:\n- to assist us in determining timely priorities, within the\ncriteria established in the Act;\na\n(FOR REFERENCE ONLY: The Act is designed to achieve activation\nof as many stations as possible in as many geographic areas as\npossible and serving as many people as possible. A basic question\nwe might put to these consultants, for example, might be: within\nthe fiscal limitations of 1969, should all funds be put to work\nactivating new channels: Or should a balance be struck between\nnew station and expansion projects? And on what basis?)\n- to assist us in the review of applications in the light of those\npriorities.\n- and to advise us on legislative requirements - bearing in mind not\nonly the requirements of broadcast hardware, but looking also to\nbroader questions which a constantly expanding communications\ntechnology poses for educators in and out of the formal school\nstructure.\nWe have received word, only a day or so ago, that Commissioner Howe has\napproved the appointment of thirteen consultants from whom we have received\nacceptances of the assignment. Would you like to know who they are?"
