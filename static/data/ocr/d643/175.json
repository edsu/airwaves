I have\nhad no reaction from any committee member, except Ray Hurlbert.\nI have received no reactions of the type to vrhieb you refer.\nIt Is Interesting to note that I. Keith Tyler is not an\nindividual member of NAEB.\nFirst, and. I do not consider this def&neively,\nI think NAEB Is doing more today for individual members than\nAERT did in its final years. They get the Journal, and the\nNewsletter. Me have never failed to have proram for them at\nColumbus and at our convention. In Journal, they111 now get\nResearch Fact Sheets. Generally speaking, but not always,\nthey have opportunities for NAEB scholarships and fellowships.\nWhat disturbs me, Is that you can't pin down these\ngneerallied criticisms. What should NAEB be doing that It is\nnot now doing --and can afford to doâ€” for the individual\nmember.\nI agree that we should do for the individual member\nwhat we can. What can we? The individual members themselves\ndon't come up with suggestions. I haven't figured out how to\nget at the problem.\nI'll discuss general problem with Gertrude sometime,\nmail or otherwise.\nRegards"
