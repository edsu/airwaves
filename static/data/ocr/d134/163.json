This would in turn be related to other arts and media by detailed comparisons and\ncontrasts.\nThe CBC in Toronto has offered to script, cast and produce many sections of the text\nwhen it is written. They will broadcast these programs and use their audience research diviÂ¬\nsion to test reactions which can be made the means of improvement in the text.
