We are accepting more programs\nthan we can distribute. I think we should be a little more\nselective. For instances, EVOLUTION OF JAZZ it is an hour\nprogram and it takes a good many tapes and most stations\ndon't want a full hour program. You must have a huge backlog\nof approvals. Don't you think it would be a good idea if we\nsent around a questionnaire upon all of the approvals and told\nthe Committee to signify the order inwhich they would place\nthese approved series? So that you don't get tied-up with too\nmany approvals and we can't take any new programs that come\nin which might be more desireable.\nCordially yours,\n\\yj> aJt&a\nWaldo Abbot\nChairman Network Acceptance Committee\nWA: mv\nAv Uuc dc - DlCovvjCu s-v-ZaJLo O-chz, ^cro dire\nFcrujcrrf^ CVUZ 0^ /ULs^XMA XASZXa\nf \\XXaw}l ^ey^Oruz frerusvtsz\n-s™ - —-- >u> ,"
