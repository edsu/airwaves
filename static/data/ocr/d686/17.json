I hope, too, that copies\nof the pronunciation guide might be made available to all of\nour member stations.\nWith all best wishes, believe me\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
