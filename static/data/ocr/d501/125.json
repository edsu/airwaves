Schooley, President\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\n111. Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Schooley:\nYou will recall in connection with the meeting of the\nAdvisory Committee of the NAEB to the President of the Center, it\nwas suggested that we attempt to carry over such unexpended funds\nas were available for radio programming in our budget this present\nyear to the next fiscal year with the hope that we might utilize\nthese funds along with some made available in next year's budget\nfor the production of one or more rather comprehensive and im¬\nportant radio program series. The Board took action at its last\nmeeting upon my recommendation to carry over these funds and,\nconsequently, we will have available a sum of money for the\npurpose indicated above.\nI presume you will want to refer this matter to your\nRadio Network Committee, the Program Planning Subcommittee\nchaired by Kenneth Wright at WOT, for consideration. Whether\nyou propose to follow this procedure or not, I am writing to\nsuggest that we are ready to discuss with you or such persons\nas you designate the possibility of doing something in the way\nof a more comprehensive program series or two depending upon\nthe cost during this next fiscal year. I should be glad to\nhave your suggestion as to the method we should follow in pro¬\nceeding with this matter at your convenience.\nSincerely yours,\nH. K. Newl\nPresident\nHKN:smp"
