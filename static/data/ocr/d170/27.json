Haakenson5s doctoral dissertation\nwas an analysis of various television discussion programs. All of\nus felt this was an outstanding dissertation.\nWhen Haakenson was here one summer he did soye work for one\nof the men in Journalism. The Journalism professor told me he felt\nHaakenson could go to work for any metropolitan newspaper in the\ncountry and hold his own. FMs is by way of say to the.t Haakenson\nhas a good imagination and writes wellf very well.\nHaakenson is one of the most pleasant and agreeable of\npersons I know. Off hand I do not know of anyone wh* did not\nboth like and respect him. I assume this would be a very important\nqualification in your Job. At the same time he is completely\nresponsible and will work endless hours.\nMost sincere!.'.\nHCHsmss\n/s/ H. Clay Harshbarge,\nProfessor-in-Charge"
