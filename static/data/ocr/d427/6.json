Hope to have an answer sometime after January 22,\nafter the MB Board meets. Xf this comes through, v© sho Id have several scholarships\nto offer to help you out financially.\nI would think that production, engineering, management and possibly promotion are\nthe most urgent areas. Production and engineering would be TV-only (including writing,\nfilnSghine problems etc.); the other two really be TV-only, so would be for both\nTelevision and Radio, Vd say. Three veekslooks fine, for each of the above, although\nsome combination into one or two courses might possibly also be acceptable. The other\npossibilities you mention (writing, programming, teaching by TV, utilisation, also look\npossible. X doubt, however, if we sho Id try to get into the utilisation end, as NAEB.\nMe therefore could probably not be expected to provide funds for that.\nAs to experts, X believe Rudy Brets and Ed Stasheff (Michigan) are tops in production?\nKeith Ketchara of VOI-TV and others whom Carl Manser might suggest would be excellent\nin engineering? and -chwarsvaldor of Houston, Harley of Visconsin, Hunter of Michigan\nState, Garrison of Michigan and many others would be good on management or general\noperations. Will give you more on this as soon as I have word on funds, i.e, within\nthe next two weeks. July, August or up to first half of September look like ?ood period®\nfor this, probably the later the better (perhaps Aug. 23-3ept. 10 or some such period).\nGlad to hear of your progress at l GET. Let us know v hat else we can do. Had I sent\nyou a blank for application for membership? Juct in case-——.\nSincerely,\nHJStdo\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
