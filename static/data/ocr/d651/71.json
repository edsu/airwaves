C.\nSubject: Experimental TV Production\nDear Bill,\nThere is no question in my mind about the propriety of originating\nthe two television series mentioned in your letter of May 25. The\ncontent of the two series is the important consideration. If they\noriginate in Washington then I should assume that the content centers\nupon areas which only the Washington locale and resources can de¬\nvelop fully and effectively. If the educational series is sub-con¬\ntracted to an NAEB member then it could deal with any subject within\nthe competence of the originating station.\nI am curious about the second series \"designed primarily for foreign\nconsumption (possibly in one or more foreign languages as well as in\nEnglish), financed by a government agency, and produced directly by\nNAEB in Washington.\" I see it as a prestige item, but not as one\nof immediate value to us unless in French, German, Spanish, or, pos¬\nsibly, Russian. This is the short, local view of course, subject to\nmodification based on more information from you.\nHL/zc\nMAY 31 1962\ni7,?,9|lplll|12|l,?1?|4|lf|?\ni"
