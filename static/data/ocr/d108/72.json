I am planning tape no. 7 and expect\nto record this next Saturday June 15. Incidentally, we shall change\nthe documentary march music introducing the Highlights section for it\nis a trifle too bold and March-of-Time like.\nI have met and talked with Mr, Douglas Overton, executive\ndirector of the learned Japan Society this week in Tokyo. He is interested\nin using Report from Japan also. He would like to purchase my scripts and\nrelease these through New York and San Francisco stations— giving them away\nSince I am the responsible writer-producer for the series, I should see no\nconflict in NAEB handling them for the fall series, and the Japan Society\nalso using them for educational release. You will recall that in our\noriginal arrangement there is no M outright purchase, exlusive rights, etc.”\nHence, I*d appreciate it if you will let me know if I may go ahead and\nsell the completed scripts to Mr. Overton for bradcast use in the States.\nNAEB by allowing 10 dollars per tape just covers transcription and mailing"
