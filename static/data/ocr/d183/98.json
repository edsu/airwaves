It was our hope\nthat certain savings would be made in this year’s budget which could be applied\nto this purchase.\nThese savings were not wholly forthcoming, but another scheme was devised which\nwill allow us to at least partially pay for the tape. First, it was determined\nthat there could be only two seminars in the summer of 1952. The first of these\nneeded to be for public school broad ting and the second in the area of tele¬\nvision. Because of the intense inte t in television, it was felt that very\nlittly money would need to be taken from this budget to support it. Therefore,\nonly the public school broadcasting seminar remained. It was agreed to take\nthe cost of this seminar, which is approximately $5,000 from the 1952-53 budget.\nOur thinking is that we can still hold a seminar, if such is needed, in the sum¬\nmer of 1953 out of the 1953-5U budget*\nI Would, therefore, like to formally request that the monies left in the Kellogg\nbudget for the educational broadcasting project, which will be between Hi,500\nand $5,500, be used to pay for a portion of the 3,000 reels of tape which we\nsecured through the University of Illinois•\nSincerely,\nJSMtll\nJim Miles\nExecutive Director"
