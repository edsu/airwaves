Schooley\n*2*\nDecember 1U, 195U\nU* Long range plans for underwriting radio and TV\nproductions*\nI still believe that a Washington office for N/EB is important for the\nlong range development of educational broadcasting* Why don*t you try\nto discover a new avenue through which you may work on Kellogg to get\nthem to underwrite a new five year plan for N/EB* which will include\nthe Washington office in addition to some new activities at headquarters?\nI don*t know whether Kellogg*s enthusiasm for educational broadcasting\ncan be revived or not but a new attack on them through someone close to\nSeay might be successful*\nI have written Bob VanDuyn asking hi; to come by to see us here on his\nnext swing south. If X can find the chance to talk to him with some ease\nI nay be able to find out what the real attitude is there at Battle Creek\nMy work moves along here toward launching TV programming in February or\nMarch, It is a busy time but not so hectic as it was when I was also\ntrying to stay on top of N/EB business* As I have said before, I am glad\nyou are on that assignment and I am trying to do a good job of one job*\nI make no promise but I still have hopes of clearing the NAEB files one\nof these days and sending them along to you. Since headquarters has\ncopies of practically everything, there is no big rush*\nWarmest regards always*\nSincerely yours.\nGZ:ap\nGraydon Ausmus\nDirector"
