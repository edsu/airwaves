Wilbur Schramm\nhas assured me of tte willingness of th© University of Illinois\nto string along with us in making him this of far* X believe we are\nall in agreement that th© time element her© is very important® Earl\nwill need a few days in which to make a decision and NAE0 needs to\nknow by th® Minneapolis meeting whether or not he will accept so that\nwe may begin plana for th© takeover or further search as dictated\nby hi© decision®\nTurning to th© preconvention Board mooting in Man©spoils\nthe agenda as outlined is very inclusive and quit© excellent® How¬\never one of th® major items of business as proposed by th® group\nwhich n»t in Urban a in September was a conference with a number of\npeople who represent organizations and institution© who are forging\nahead with plans for TV development so we may chart th® pattern ahead\nwith greater conservation of energies and this item per m is not\noutlined in th® agenda* On® of tbs most constructive steps w© can\ntake at Minneapolis will b® to shape up a blue print for our contri¬\nbution to th® development of educational TV as an organization as\nwell as attempting to coordinate our activities with otter organisa¬\ntions and institutions® I should like, therefore, to appoint a work*\ning committee on a temporary basis - illegal and unofficial, if you\nwish - miich would spend considerable time between now and th® meeting\nand during the first period of th® meeting projecting NAEB into the\nTV picture as far as possible - laying out a positive and vital pro¬\ngram in the TV area* X would hope that this committee could meet in\nMinneapolis as early as noon on Sunday, November 2, to explore all\npossible avenues for TV operation - including perhaps the takeover\nof the JCET functions and some vigorous ro3® in the \"million dollar”\nFAE TV project* Perhaps m should establish our own film exchange\nservice in the immediate future so w© not only hav© some plans to\npresent but a project underway to point to. Si informs me that ruch\nis now a reality*"
