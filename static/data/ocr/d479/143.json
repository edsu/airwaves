Friendship ties are more likely to develop on the basis of\njob, church, acticity, or organizational contacts than on the basis of where people's\nhomes are located. During the Experiment, Ways of Mankind block groups had to com¬\npete with these other stronger, existing ties for the time and attention of people\nin the block, many of whom were virtually strangers to each other. This competition\nproved insurmountable. Furthermcr e, block gucups tended to inherit whatever fric¬\ntions and animosities may have previously developed among neighbors, and this in¬\nhibited discussion, naturally enough. It shouh be noted, however, that no block\ngroups were attempted in what may be termed ’’homogeneous neighborhoods” - neighbor¬\nhoods where people felt a strong sense of identification with each other on the basis\nof poverty, race, or ethnic background or other factors. Where these factors are\nassociated with distinct neighborhoods block groups might possibly succeed.\n3. Members of groups organized, from ranks of the same formal organization\nsonetimes appeared to attend more from a sense of duty than 'from strong pnrsznal\ndesire. Their participation frequently was both intermittent and ps rfunctory.\nBackgrounds of group members\nMembers of the same \"friendship” groups tended to have some common bond which\nenabled them to identify easily with the total group. Usually, but not always, this\nwas social-economic level. For example, consider the membership of these groups:\nGroup One; Doctors, lawyers, very successful businessmen, persons holding responsible\nexecutive positions in business establishments or governmental agencies, and their\nwives.\nGroup Two: Carpenter, garage mechanic, store clerk, airplain repair welder, and their\nwives.\nProfessional interest also tended to bring people together. Two grups primari¬\nly of sohool teachers and librarians were reported."
