We must use television and radio to enable the ghetto itself\nto communicate with the outside world, to \"tell it like it is.\" We\nmust use the media to affect the thoughts and feelings of white\nAmerica in a positive way to forward the principles of democracy\nand humanity. We must have increased and more imaginative use of\nradio and television to provide urgently needed upgraded formal\neducation for children and formal and informal education and training\nfor adults. We must exploit radio and television's subjective,\npsychological non-content effect on both the inner-city and outer-\ncity resident. The Commission on Civil Disorders does well, I\nthink, in its evaluation of the media as information carriers.\n\\\nHowever, the media change not only the content, but the entire\nbehavior and learning and growth patterns of our children and even\nof adults. The child entering school who has watched TV--even non-\nselectivity--is much better informed, all other things being equal,\nthen the child who hasn't watclied TV. (A child has watched some\nthree to four thousand hours of TV by the time he has entered the\nfirst grade.) But information is the least important of it. More\nimportant is the child's special awareness of visual observation and\nlearning, his abilities to relate non-immediate, mediated experiences\nto live experiences\n/and to print description, his openness to the utilization of media\nfor learning development as well as being able to sitâ€”maybe rightfully\nimpatiently and uncomfortably--at the other end of the educational log."
