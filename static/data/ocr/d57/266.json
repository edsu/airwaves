December 5, 1957\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr, Rider;\nMr, Edward Stanley has suggested the possibil^ that\nthe Educational Radio Network might be interested in a\nseries of productions from Europe, Last year I produced\nand conducted an NBC-Radio • series under the title ‘‘Gan\nFreedom Win?*’* under the guidance of Mr, Stanley, and there\nfore, had written to him proposing a series of intimate\ninterviews with European leaders of thought and the arts.\nHe kindly responded by explaining that all shows here are\ndone by KBG staffers as a matter of policy, and giving me\nyour name,\nThe assignments I have been able to set up will take\nme constantly throughout Western Europe, with seasonal head\nquarters in Paris and Gap d*Antibes. While my major work\nhere will be writing for magazines — The Reader’s Digest,\nThis Week, etc, — I am much interested in continuing my\nlong-time activities as a creator and producer of public\naffairs and educational radio and television programs.\nYour advice will be greatly appreciatad.\nSincerely\n*Other relatively recent ’’credits\": \"State of the Nation\"\n(Mutual), \"Answers for Americans\" (ABG-TV), \"Ghronoscope\"\n(GB3-TV), \"Mr, Ambassador\" (Mutual).\nP.3, Another thought is a series of taped interviews with\nAmerican Ambassadors.\nGG; Mr, Edward Stanley\nMeME GROUPE\n[HOTEL MEURICE — LE GRAND HOTEL PARIS\n(HOTEL DE FRANCE, CONAKRY, GUIN^E FRANCAISE"
