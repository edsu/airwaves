White, President of NET speaking:\n\"If public television is ever to become a major force in our\nnational life -- if it is to achieve stature, public respect,\nand public support - -it will do so not because we were quiet\nand balanced, but because we spoke truth and spoke it boldly\nand performed a valuable public service not available in any\nother place. Don't tell me there are those who would drive\nyou out of town if you did this. I know there are those who\nwill try.\nBut the simple question is: Will we do what we believe is\nright or will we do only what we know we can do without ruffling\nfeathers? If we do what we believe is right, and do it well,\nI don't think they can drive us out of town. Now is the time for\nconscience to rule our actions; it is not the time for expendiency\nor even for compromise. You cannot compromise with prejudice\nor ignorance or apathy. \"\n* * * sjc #\nFor this report, I'm including a reprint from TELEVISION which tirr41l\ngive you a good cross section view of what our commercial bretheren are up to.\nThe national picture is excellent. They are also on the train.\n* * * *\nWGBH, Boston jumped into this thing a long time ago. The momentum\nis still there.\nITEM: \"Volunteer -- Why Bother? zeros in on the tendency of many\nyoung people today to withdraw from society rather than actively try\nto change the things they reject. The program begins with an excerpt\nfrom an earlier program, \"Lettvin Tuned In\" which M. I. T. Professor\nJerome Lettvin urging his young audience to \"reach out\" not \"drop out. \""
