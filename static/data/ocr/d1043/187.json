He has\nreason to believe support far such a proposal would be rather readily\nforthcoming o\nThere are undoubtedly three areas of training which eventually\nneed to be done. 1 list these (not necessarily in order of importance)\nass (1) Engineering\n(2) Management\n(3) Programming and Production\nIn weighing the importance of these, it seems to me the followÂ¬\ning is true.\n(1) RCA and other labs are running short courses\nfor television engineers* Ralph Townsley of WBAA and Bob Johnston of\nWILL attended one of these last September and report them to be very\nfine* I believe they are answering the need at this time*\n(2) In this area, a meeting is undoubtedly\nneeded of 20 to 25 people some time within the next year* These\nwould be people who are managing television stations and who will\nmanage them* Undoubtedly this would be a one-time affair*"
