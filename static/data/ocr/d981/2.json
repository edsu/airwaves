S* which might serve that need. UNESCO Itself hopes\nfor a center “to consist mainly of national co-ordinating committees or associations • *\nNo U. S. organization is now equipped to serve as such a coordinating group in the\neducational broadcasting field*\nNben we requested an official spokesman of UNESCO to address the last NAEB\nAnnual Convention, Director General Luther Evans delegated the Director of UNESCO S\nDepartment of Hass Ccranrunications for this responsibility*\nSpeaking before the Convention, Dr. Tor Gjesdal first paid tribute to the NAEB\nwhich “has won international fame, because it is a unique institution. Your aims\n*>nH achievements have won you respect and provided inspiration to others. His\nfirst challenge to the NAEB was “to continue your work and expand it — to continue\nletting UNESCO know about it.*.Your experiences are of international importance.\""
