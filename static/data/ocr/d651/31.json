I would go further and\nobserve that here is a clear demonstration that NAEB does\nnot truly represent its membership in the fashion that a\nprofessional association should. It would appear that the\nposition of the TV Board, the elected representatives of\nthe TV stations, was overturned by a majority made up of\nnon-television members.\nI have been disturbed about NAEB for some time. To recite\nall the reasons for this unrest would take more space than\nI can give here. As a result of my feelings, I have not\nauthorized payment of KVIE dues for 1962. Several times I\nhad thought I might and have subsequently held back. This\nmost recent action confirms my earlier decision and dues\nwill not now be forthcoming.\nM\nTo be at least somewhat constructive, I urge that the vested\ninterests in NAEB invite an objective analysis of the\nAssociation to determine whether its purposes are to encourage\na strong educational broadcasting system in cooperation with\nall other agencies in the field, or whether those purposes\nare to preserve NAEB in competition with many other influences\nthat have come on the scene.W\nRECE\nNAEB HEAD\nJUN 8 1962\nAM P to\n7|8|9|ip1n|12|J.|2|3|4|S|6\nCENTRAL CALIFORNIA EIDTTC-A.TIOHSLAL TELEVISION, INC."
