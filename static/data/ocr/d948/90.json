Over\na third of the members had requested a session on the fundamentals of radio writ¬\ning, since it developed that although they were currently charged with the respon¬\nsibility of writing whatever local scripts were being produced on their respective\nstation, they had had little or no formal training in radio writing.

Space limitations do not permit more than the listing of these: How to\nOrganize and Plan an Interview Series, and an Individual Interview Program; Quality\nvs. Quantity in Educational Radio Production; Problems in the Use of Student Tal¬\nent; Problems in Individual Formats.\nIt had been planned originally to devote an entire day to the problems of\nwriting various program types, and so the last point was postponed until the fol¬\nlowing day.
