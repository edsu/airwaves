But the best advices here are that even\nthough our committee doing a bang-up job, the odds are perhaps a little\nagainst it; and the dean certainly recommended that I not make any positive\nplans depending upon legislative appropriation. In this case surely, a\ndollar in the till is worth any number in committee hearings1\nfou asked for a recommendation as to whommight be the third member of\nthe Screening Committee. I think Harold hngel would be ideal. He had a\n^ulbright scholarship, you know, and I think is the only member of our\ngroup who ever received one. He should know something about the whole\nbusiness, and he also had the opportunity to work abroad under auspices\nsomewhat like this. In addition to that Harold has breadth of vision, is\nwell informed as to the problems of educational ibroadcastin&, and would\nbe above pettiness or maliciousness in passing on the qualifications of\npeople with whom he is closely associated or with whom he might have\ncrossed swords at some time or another. If he isn't available, I think\nMac would be good for the same reasons (excepting of course the fact that\nhe never was a ^ulbright scholar; however he did go to England for awhile\nto study the BBC).\nI am sorry that our trip to the Gulf is off. But Sarah's broken leg\nput an end to Momma's travels for aw^hile, and indeed will keep Daddy at\nhome even more than before, too!\nWith best personal regards.\nBurton Paulu\nVice President\nBP:cjm"
