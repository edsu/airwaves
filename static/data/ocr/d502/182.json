We are\nnot quite sure whether we have a problem or not but\nwe are certainly concerned that Mr. Vincent Skillman,\nwho heads the union does not indicate any cooperation\nwith us. We, of course, are not looking for free music.\nWe do feel that in the beginning the musician’s union\nshould play ball with us. For example, the local\norchestral society, Sinfonettia, have decided to donate\n£wo full performances to WKNO-TV. All performances\nafter that will require pay. We are hopeful that it\nmight be less than union scale but have not discussed\nthis with them or the union.\nWe would appreciate knowing the working arrangements\nother educational television stations have with their\nmusic unions. We do understand that several do allow\ncollege faculty musicians, who are union members, to\nappear without fee as a part of their college duties.\nWe do want to establish strong and lasting relationships\nwith the Music'Union and your advice would be appreciated.\nWe do not think we need pressure at this time from the\nnational level.\nWe await your advice.\nKJNsam\nEXECUTIVE TRUSTEES\nOR. MOU-111 P PRICE\nBROTHEI* LEV1AN THOMA*\nWALLACE JOHNSTON\nJOHN R GORMAN\nMRS MILTON WILSON\nERNESTC BALL"
