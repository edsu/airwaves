  "text": "Kit Number 5\nA CASE STUDY IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\nGood elementary classroom teachers should USE television les¬\nsons, not justfollow them. We cannot count on automatic learning just\nbecause the child is face-to-face with an instrument of learning or just\nbecause he has witnessed a commendable presentation . Television, like\nany other instrument, can bring the lesson and the child together. The\nclassroom teacher must apply the \"glue\" which makes the lesson stick!\nIt is not enough for the classroom teacher to be an echo or a\ncaboose simply parroting or re-teaching the lesson content. As \"manager\nof the learning situation,11 the classroom teacher has the primary responsi¬\nbility for clarifying, extending, and reinforcing the concepts involved.\nThe television lesson can be geared to any of the many methods\nwhich teachers use; so can the preparation for the television lesson and\nthe follow-through.\nHow each teacher in the classroom makes his or her \"glue\" de¬\npends upon what is to be accomplished, what objectives the teacher has\nin mind, and whatkindof learning is sought (skiI Is, knowledge, attitudes,\nvalues, understandings, and/or appreciations). It depends upon the\npurpose of the television series as a whole, the purpose of this specific\nlesson and this teacher's own purposes in using the lesson.\nIt depends, also, in important measure, upon this particular\nteacher's personal \"glue\" recipe . . . compounded of the teacher's\nspecial touch and personality, the teacher's own skills and strengths.\nF-3"
