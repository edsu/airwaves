C.\nDear Bill:\nI hope you have recovered from the strenuous week in Miami and Columbus. I was\nsorry that such a traumatic experience as Saturday's had to cap off this ultra\nbusy time for all of us. I think that Hull more than likely has the right Idea\nand that John more than likely will send along the necessary resignation message.\nI am writing primarily to firm up the question of United States invitees to the\nPurdue International Seminar. If it is agreeable with you we thought that per¬\nhaps McBride, because of his recent Title VII study, could give the best U. S.\nposition paper regarding instructional television. We then thought that perhaps\nMcBride could stay on as one of the U. S. delegates. In addition to McBride\nwe feel that there should be someone with a strong NETRC connection, perhaps\nwe could pick up a third person who would put us over into the area of commercial\nbroadcasting. This latter is especially true in view of the fact that the\nInternational Assembly sponsored by TIO/NAB will follow ours by a few weeks.\nI have no name to suggest for the second person above, perhaps Hull could do it\nif he would. For the commercially oriented person, someone like Larry Creshkoff\nor perhaps Parker Wheatly might be accepted in both camps.\nI really need these names in the near future. It is understood, of course, that\nPurdue will do the inviting but I am certain we will follow closely your recom¬\nmendations .\nHope you have a good time In Switzerland and that you get to visit some of the\nother interesting spots while you are that far overseas. I hope, too, that we\ncan get to Fletcher before you leave if possible."
