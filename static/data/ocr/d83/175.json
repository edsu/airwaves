The answer is very simple«\nNew media moh as photography* navies or radio*\nimmediately alter our sense lives* They change at once\nthe ways In which we ace* or hear* or touch* or feel\nourselves and our world* Even a slight alteration in\none of our five senses changes the ratio among all the\nsenses. People suddenly begin to think differently* to\nwant and appreciate things which had never interested\nthem before. TV is the moat recent medium to affect our\nsense lives* and the effect in no way depends upon any\nideas we may have concerning it. Its onslaught on our\nsenses is total* and we are entirely vulnerable and un¬\ndefended.\nSince there is no time to explain the whole pattern\nand dynamics of the TV image* let us simply not© that It\nmakes the viewer the screen and drives him Inward. Its\nbroken lines and points communicate a powerful tactual\nimage* with sculptural contours rather than visual defin¬\nition. This image favours a habit of experience in\ndepth in all our sensibilities. Depth in motivation study*\ndepth in reading and in word awareness* depth in textures\nin our homes* our cars* our food. And above all* depth\nof participation in all those processes from which we\nhad formerly accepted the product in passivity.\nThis latter obsession with process includes the\ncreative process as much as in sports and dancing.\nMarch 18/S0,"
