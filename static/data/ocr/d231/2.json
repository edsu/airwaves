Burrows\nAssistant Director of Broadcasting\nAdministration Building\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Ed:\nI should like you to accept appointment as\nChairman of the Radio Network Acceptance Comm¬\nittee of NAEB for the year 1961. This is an\nimportant responsibility and one that I hope\nthat you can accept.\nEnclosed is a list of suggested names of other\nmembers of the committee. I should like to\nbegin this year a plan to help insure fuller\nparticipation by the membership in committee\nactivities by involving \"new blood\", while yet\npreserving continuity; namely, an arrangement\nwhereby members would be appointed for stipu¬\nlated terms of three, two or one year. After\nthe first year, three members would go off\nand three new members come on annually. Chair¬\nman would have one year appointments but be\neligible for reappointment.\nMay I have your reactions and suggestions as\nsoon as possible so that I can complete the\ncommittee roster for announcement in the next\nNewsletter.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:mem\nEnclosure"
