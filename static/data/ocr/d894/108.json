Motion Picture Associa¬\ntion President Eric Johnston\napd Federal .Education Com¬\nmissioner John Studebaker filed\non Page 5)\nMayflower Hearings\nTo Continue Apr. 19\n(Continued from Page 1)\nletters with the Commission opposing\nthe Mayflower ruling. Johnson de¬\nclared that the question seems to him\nto come down to one of interpreta¬\ntion of the first article of the Bill of\nRights—“Congress shall make no law\n. . . abridging the freedom of speech;\nor of the press.”\n\"A Human Right\"\nThe emphasis there, he said, “is\nplaced on the right of the individual\nto speak, to utter, to express himself,\nby whatever means best suits his pur¬\npose and not alone through the press.”\n“Freedom of expression is, in my\nopinion,” Johnston wrote, “a human\nright, an individual right and not one\nconfined to the practitioners of any\nparticular profession of expression,\nbut on the contrary given freely to\nall Americans, through whatever me¬\ndia might suit their purposes.\n“It might be conjectured with rea¬\nson that the authors of the bill oi\nrights intuitively recognized that\nother media besides the press might\nsome day be available to the indi¬\nvidual—which, of course, has hap¬\npened.\nvV'e either believe in the guarantee\nof free speech or we don’t; we either\nbelieve that freedom of utterance,\nfreedom of expression and freedom\nof exhibition are inseparable, or we\ndeny the clear intent of the Bill of\nRights. Free speech cannot be com¬\npartmentalized, it is free for all me¬\ndia, or it is free for none. If it is not\nfree for every media, then it is not\nfree for the individual, and if it is\nnot, the Bill of Rights becomes a bill\nof limitations.\nDr. Studebaker Heard\n“For this reason, I feel very strong¬\nly that no instrument of expression,\nincluding the radio, should be re¬\nstricted, openly or indirectly, in the\nexercise of free speech guaranteed\nby the Constitution.”\nDr. Studebaker said he believes the\nMayflower ban “impairs the ability\nof the licensee to discharge his obli¬\ngations to present all sides of impor¬\ntant questions, fairly, objectively and\nwithout bias.” He said he feels thati\nthe ban prevents licensees from liv-/\n&rupftA this obligation—which was^\n,»jo put forth,by the FCC in its May-\nlower decision.\nMayflower Supporters Heard\n,« Again Friday the Commission heard\nstatements urging that the Mayflower\nlolicy be retained. Among the wit¬\nnesses were representatives of the\nlarious talent and craft guilds of the\nftidustry. All opposed any relaxation\n% the ban on editorializing.\nAnother letter, from President\nGeorge Shuster, of Hunter College,\nNew York, expressed support for the\nMayflower decision. Dr. Shuster said,\n“Editorializing would be desirable\nonly if something like a letter-to-the-\neditor arrangement were adopted.\n... A program on which criticisms\nof the editorial broadcasts of the day\nprevious would be featured at the\nsame time that the current editorial\nwas put on the air.’\nO Thomas Franklin, editorial su¬\npervisor of the news bureau of KYA\nSan Francisco, wrote in a personal\ncapacity “to register the strongest\npossible approval of the Commission!\nopposition to editorializing by rad r\nbroadcasters. Equally, I am inflexibly\nopposed to the appeal by the broad-\n! casting industry that radio newsmen\nbe °|1nwfd _flL editorialize,'\nj"
