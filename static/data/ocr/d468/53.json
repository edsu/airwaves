One man\ntries ten Jobs: merchant* lawyer* doctor, minister of religion^ He\nhas lived in twenty places, and nowhere found ties to detain him.\nAnd why not? Men here have no eettledhabits; and circumstances pre¬\nvent them finding any. Many have come from Europe, leaving their Ufe\nand traditions behind. Through a strange inversion, it is Nature that\nchanges while man stays the same. One single man can give his n-'-rae\nto a wilderness that none has crossed before him, can see the first\nforest tree fall, and the first planter8 s house rise in the solitude,\nwhere a corananity comes, then a village, and then a vast city® In\nthe short space between birth and death, one man sees all those changes,\nand thousands of others have done the same. In his youth, he has lived\namong nations which now no longer exist except in hi stay. In his life¬\ntime, rivers have changed their courses or diminished their flow, the\nvery climate is other than he knew it$ and all that is to the Ameri¬\ncan but the first step in a limitless career, a gr> at adventure,\nMUSIC; FINALE: ESTABLISH THEN BG FOR TOC:\nTOC: The nations of our time cannot prevent the conditions of men from be¬\ncoming equal, but it depends upon themselves whether the principle of\nequality is to lead them to servitude or freedom, to knowledge or bar¬\nbarism, to prosperity or wretchedness,\nFINALE UP AND TO END,\nMUSIC:"
