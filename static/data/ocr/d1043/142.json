The final set of discussions was devoted to \"Next Steps in Order to\nFurther the Development of Educational Television”, and here consideration was\ngiven to the complex and highly practical problems of developing necessary\nunderstanding of and support for educational television; creation of one or\nmore production centers where educational programs of high quality may be pro¬\nduced; fostering interchange of programs and program ideas among educational\nstations, as soon as such stations actually get on the air; and the possibility\nof creating a \"national commission\" of outstanding educators and laymen to de¬\nvelop support for the extension of educational values through television, to\nprovide a means by which citizens may express their preferences for TV programs,\nand related objectives.\nThe Institute avoided preparation and adoption of resolutions, but at a\nconcluding plenary session on Thursday morning, under the chairmanship of Dr.\nEdgar Fuller, Chairman of JCET, made clear its unanimous concern that there be\na maximum response, within the year, to the opportunity presented to the\nAmerican people by the Federal Communications Commission in reserving channels\nfor ownership and operation by educational groups. The recommendations of the\nInstitute have already been discussed. Action to follow up these recommenda¬\ntions is vigorously under way, not only in the Council offices, but in a number\nof areas where local institutes are being planned. The Joint Committee on\nEducational Television and the Council look forward to cooperating to the\nfullest possible extent with all groups, as efforts are made to explore tele¬\nvision's potential for education, and ways and means of realizing that potential.\nMay 22, 1952"
