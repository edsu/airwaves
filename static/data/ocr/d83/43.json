A letter should accompany the form to the effect that I\nwas employed as Secretary to Prof. McLuhan from the dates as\nyou have them recorded and (this is important) that I did not\nduring that period pay Unemployment Insurance.\nBest regards, Rose. I hope to be able to drop you a\nlonger line soon.\nBy the way, if you could put this back in the mail,\naddressed to me at 116 Lynd'hurst Ave., as above, the same day or\nfollowing day you receive it, I would appreciate it very much.\nI should have it in my hands Thursday. Thanks again.\nEnclosures.\nThis is rather a disjointed letter, isn*t it? I just noticed\nthat the form calls for the Employer's name and the EmployerÂ»s\naddress. I think N.A.E.B., 14 Gregory Hall, Urbana, Illinois,\nwould be correct here, rather than Prof. McLuhan*s address on\nSt. Joseph, since I was paid by the N.A.E.B."
