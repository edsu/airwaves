With Charles the Tenth replaced by Louis\nPhillips, there is very little place for my services; it\nis well known that I am a supporter of the Bourbonso\nBEAU:\nTo say nothing of our being required to take the oath of\nallegiance twice: that was nothing but a deliberate insult0\nTOC:\nMy friends are sufficiently outraged at my having taken the\noath once. Louis de Kergolay 0 . o you know him?\nBEAU:\nSlightly*,\nTOC:\nHe wrote me a most stinging letter referring to the incorruptible\nMalesherbes (who was an ancestor of mine)o The pages were\nBEAU:\npeppered with ’‘dishonour\", \"perjury”, \"traitor\", \"cupidity\",\n\"subterfuge\", \"degradation\". I fear I replied to him as hotly*.\nWell, this is the work of the ^uly Revolution. The bourbons\nmay have gone: but fathers and sons have become enemies over\nthemo Brother*s hand is set against brother; and all for the\ncause of the banished Bourbons0\nTOC:\nIn other words, our position in France has become intolerable*.\nThis trip to America will form a sort of voluntary exile.\nBEAU:\nIf they will give is permission.\nTOC:\nBEAU:\nWhy should they not? We are paying our own expenses.\nTo study the American prisons; well, that is a legitimate\noccupation for a pair of young magistrates.\nBEAU:"
