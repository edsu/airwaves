A \"Voices of Asia\" opener and closer on the rest of the\nprogram© would b© nice* For your information I8sa enclosing a\ncopy of an opener used on on© of our seri es# the Cooper Union\nForuxa* Something like—\"Voice© of Asia# In cooperation with\n{The Japanese Radio Corporrtion) we present# by tape recording#\nfor dietri -ution exclusively through the Rational Association\nof Educational Broadcasters**»#•*—or something such# better\nworded# would do tho trick adequately#\n2) Ga quality# some fussiness, as if a head were out of adjustment#\nis ©vidsnt# but 1Ms ianH too serious® Much of the trouble is\nin getting mikes close enough to female voices# or vice versa#\nso y© don*t lose parts* Also# w© believe the dubbed«on opener\nand closer are of too good level and quality by comparison with\nth© rest* Whatever can be done on levels in general will bo\nappreciated®\n3) Could Goralski also re~pronoup for us# or r&=misproncunce#sucI>\nthings as losses (like for instruments) so Americans will get a\nvford-imags?\n4) We feel aim that the program as now done is too much a standard\napproach* . Any m>& Goralski could capitalize more on being in\nJapan? The University of Chicago Roundtable of ten does what was\ndiscussed on at least one* The music on the one was good* Sven\nif topics need to be changed to capture more \"color\"# I think m9d\nlike* More a repcarting or candid camera and less a discussion\nprogram is needed# though limitations may be too great hero# as\nin technical problems#"
