Plus |1,800 from School of Journalism and Communications.\n2. The original request to Kellogg was based on a five-year grant and\nsalaries were averaged for that period in order to permit the grant\nremaining the same in each of the five years. Based on anticipated\nturn over of personnel and contingent (in our calculations) upon\nKellogg letting us apply any salaries monies remaining, at the end\nof each year, to the suceeding year, we indicated we could get along\nwith $29,750 each year rather than the actual $3B,054.45 average\nfigure. However, Kellogg refused to let us apply year-ehd balances\n(except that balances not budgetecKun to the $29,750 annuallyâ€”\ncould be used later) and used the average figures as a maximum they\nwould not exceed. However, the above 3-year total is $89,180.05\nslightly less than the $89,250 (3 x 29,750) allowable and this will\nwork out, presuming they don't object to our cutting the labor item\nin half to achieve this,\n3. Again due to average figures submitted, this amount is in excess^jf\nthe maximum, but the Foundation should be agreeable to this slight\nincrease in this particular item.\nHEH:jg"
