Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nUnder contract with the U.S. Office of Education, the NAEB has been pro¬\nceeding through the first stages of its project to develop a series of kits\nwhich will form the basis of a Teaching Materials Library designed to\nassist teachers to make better classroom use of educational broadcasts.\nSince the contract's activation, the NAEB has appointed an Advisory\nCommittee, prepared and distributed a brochure describing the service,\nand made presentations concerning the project at meetings of educational\norganizations.\nThe Advisory Committee called for under the contract has met twice to\nestablish the specific purpose and content of each of the kits and to re¬\nview treatment of the subject matter which has been prepared by a\nprofessional writer. The Committee has supported the original concept\nof the project, but after the close examination of the materials which was\npossible only as the Advisory group became involved In the project, it\nwas felt that some of the technical matters relating to the production of\nthe kits could be substantially improved by preparing the material\ndirectly on film rather than on kinescope recording.\nSince the kits are being designed primarily for school presentations, it\nhas not been practical to consider video tape as a satisfactory recording\nand distribution vehicle. Although the technical quality of kinescope\nrecordings is much improved over past years, even this improvement does\nnot meet die standards which the Committee feels are essential to broad\nacceptance and use of these materials."
