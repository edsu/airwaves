Mix\nDATE: January 19, 1955\nSUBJECT: Chicago Roundtable, Stories 'n\nStuff, Children’s Circle and\nSchools Today,\nI vote \"yes\" for all four series to be distributed on the network. I regret\nto say we are discontinuing Stories ’n Stuff for the time being, but hope\nto reinstate it as soon as we find a place in the schedule. Children’s\nCircle has also been discontinued, but will be included in the schedule as\nsoon as time is available.\nSchools Today is scheduled for four months beginning in February, and like\nyou. Jack, we take Chicago Roundtable from our local NBC station,\nA special word about Children’s Circle, We have found that to be an excel¬\nlent program for pre-school children. And don't think they don't listen to\nthe radio. The week after we took it off the schedule, one of the mothers\nin town called us and told us she was very sorry we had stopped broadcasting\nit. Her little boy, three years old I think, listened to it religiously and\ncried the day he tuned it in and couldn't find it. You think my conscience\ndidn't bother me? Still does, for that matter.\nSorry my votes are a little late arriving, but I've been out of town a good\ndeal in the past weeks."
