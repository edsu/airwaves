This also is pre-BFA, was done on\nWNYC and other stations, and is distributed by BFA but also\notherwise (by the Christiansens I presume, though I'm not\ncertain).\nSwedish Radio does not object to distributing the shows\ncreated for BFA to other stations, Including NAEB, and to\nthese via NAEB, I am Inclined to doubt the propriety of\ncutting in on BFA Initiative here, but will leave that\ndecision with you folks, where it belongs. But surely no\none could object if we arranged for things distributed by the\nChristiansens to be handled through Urbana too, if we wanted\nthem.\nIt seems to me the problems are these. First, Swedish\nradio is confused about the NAEB-BFA relationship. I hope\nI explained this clearly, and shall do so again if occasion\npresents itself. We also have to decide if we want to combine\nforces with BFA to get some of our stations on their\ndistribution list. I made no commitments of any kind here.\nRadio Sweden does not know just how many and what\nstations are getting BFA Swedish programs. I suggested they\nshould ask for that Information. I had the feeling BFA\nwas stalling them off until they had a large list to show.\nWell, there you have it. You take it from here. The\nbest contact in Radio Sweden would bei Mrs. Karin Bergman,\nSveriges Radio, Valhallavagen 11?, Stockholm 7, Sweden. I\ngave her Harry's name as the NAEB contact.\nI'll try to find what I can of BFA activities when I\nget to Copenhagen, Hamburg and Berlin, and will report if\nthere is anything to say.\nRegards to all.\nBPjds"
