He presents (1) the introduction which is usually historical\nbackground. (2) discusses safety rules with Y-O-U (the individual viewer) and (3)\nplays a safety game with a COMMON ORDINARY FOOL and Y-O-U. During the\ngame, he re-emphasizes and adds to the information already presented.\nJiminy9 s Creed:\nJiminy Cricket says, “There’s two ways to do anything. The right way and the wrong\nway. If you want to be right do things the right way —because if you do things the\nwrong way that’s the foolish way. Only fools do things the foolish way —which is the\nwrong way —Right?”\nJiminy Cricket9s Song:\nI'M NO FOOL, NO, SIR- REE.' I WAN-NA LIVE TO BE NINE- TY THREE/\n& &IK 7 D7 Grl cn f\nI PLAY SAFE FOR YOU ANO ME 'CAUSE I'M NO FOOL !\nOn a Bicycle:\nProgram Digest:\n1. Bicycle comes from ‘bi’ (two) and ‘cyclos’ (circle or wheel), two wheels.\nThe first bicycle was invented in France about 1810. Improvements finally resulted\nin our Modern Safety Bicycle, which is probably the most widely used vehicle the world\nhas ever known.\n2. Now Y-O-U find out how to get the most out of a bicycle —Keep both hands on the\nhandle bars, except when signalling —both wheels on the ground —both feet on the\npedals so brakes can be used quickly. Know, use and obey the same traffic rules and\nsignals that apply to cars.\n3. JIMINY has a bicycle riding contest between Y-O-U and a COMMON ORDINARY\nFOOL.\nEarly Bicycle Bone Shaker High-wheel Bicycle Modern Bicycle\n* This “ Tele-Digest,, has been prepared by Mrs. Margaret Divizia, Supervisor Copyright 1955 Walt Disney Productions\nin Charge, Audio-Visual Section, Los Angeles City Schools.
