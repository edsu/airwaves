B.)—called for the “bicycle network” for its system of\ncirculating tape-recorded lectures, dramas and music among eighty-\ntwo operating stations—left last <$>-\naboard the lie de\nmonth’s tour of\nWednesday\nFrance for\nEurope.\nThey will confer with broad¬\ncasters in London, Paris, Geneva\nand Rome in an attempt to widen\ntheir exchange of programs. And\nthey will offer American program¬\nming that has been termed “the\nmost dramatic development on the\nNorth American Continent,” by\nNeil Morrison, production chief of\nthe Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\nN. A. E. B. began to pedal in 1949.\nFormer President Herbert Hoover,\nin 1925, when he was Secretary of\nCommerce, dalled a conference of\nall broadcasters. A small group of\ncolleges formed as a separate spoke\nin this high-wheeled era of radio.\nAfter twenty-four years of coast¬\ning, the bicycle .network since '49\nhas added forty-seven stations to\nits original thirty-five; has de¬\nveloped a headquarters and staff\nat the University of Illinois,\nUrbana; and has grown from an\norganization handling $2,000 yearly\ndues to administration of $1,200,-\n000 grants. This year it has ear¬\nmarked $80,000 for colleges to pro¬\nduce radio and television shows.\nGet Rockefeller Grant\nProviding pavement for the bi¬\ncycle network was a grant from\nthe Rockefeller Foundation to the\nUniversity of Illinois. With these\nfunds, a seminar for members of\nN. A. E. B. was held in July, 1949,\nand it was decided to exchange pro¬\ngram resources. This gave the long\nhesitant stations a push. WNYC,\nNew York’s municipally owned\nAM and FM stations put in leg\npower and seated a jockey with\nmore than patter about platters.\nSeymour N. Siegel, the forty-\nfour-year-old jockey, WNYC’s di¬\nrector and N. A. E. B.’s president, is\naccompanied on the European\ntour by George Probst, director of\nthe “University of Chicago Round¬\ntable,” which is a continuous pro¬\ngram on the network; and Parker\nWheatley, of WGBH, Boston, and\nthe Lowell Institute Broadcasting\nCouncil. They will join Mr. Mor¬\nrison in London.\nThe tour grew from a meeting\nof CBS and N. A. E. B. with British\nBroadcasting Corp. executives, who\ncycle of educational programs.\nSteering for the rough television\nterrain ahead, the N. A. E. B. offi¬\ncials hope to stimulate the ex¬\nchange of educational films be¬\ntween the United States and Eu¬\nrope for the bicycle network. Be¬\nsides talking with broadcasters the\nN. A. E. B. team will confer at\nAmerican embassies, with Voice of\nAmerica representatives and Mu¬\ntual Security Agency aids.\nSees Greatest Program Exchange\n“These conferences will produce\nthe greatest interchange of cut\ntural and information programs\nthat has ever been seen,” Mr. Sie-\ngal predicted. “We haven’t the\ntime to make a bicycle trip across\nEurope, but we are taking our bi¬\ncycle network over there as a for¬\nward moving vehicle of American\nradio.\n‘N. A. E. B. has outgrown the bi¬\ncycle tag we took after the Allerton\nHouse conferences in ’49. We are\ntape network with the facilities\nfor duplicating a wide range of\nprograms at high speed for im¬\nmediate distribution. With TV be¬\nfore us—there’ll be two dozen edu¬\ncational channels operating by the\nend of next year—we must travel\nto wider fields to obtain educa¬\ntional films as well as radio pro¬\ngrams.”\nN. A. E. B. attempts to provide the\nunderprivileged one-third of\nAmerican radio listeners with the\nequivalent of the British Third\nprogram, which is regarded as the\noutstanding cultural broadcast in\nthe world. The Allerton House\nseminar began pumping the bi¬\ncycle network for this highbrow\ncrest after examining commercial\nradio’s findings that 70 per cent of\nAmerican listeners thought the\noutput of private stations served\nthe community better than gov¬\nernments, schools, churches and\npress.\nThe educational broadcasters\nagreed that as an engine of enter¬\ntainment, American commercial\nradio was the best in the world.\nBut, with no advertisers to rely\nupon nor talent to pay nor pay\nrolls to meet, N. A. E. B. decided\nthat it had the opportunity to de¬\nvote large blocks of tijne to broad-\nI framed the plan for enlarging the casting significant information.\n“It takes twenty years for lis¬\nteners to learn of the availability\nof a program, we found. Ann de¬\nveloping good taste in an audience\nby exposure to large quantities of\nthe best in music, drama and gen¬\neral information requires more\ntime than the commercial contract\nof thirteen or twenty-six weeks\nprovides,” Mr. Siegel said.\n“We were convinced that it is\nas unnatural for a person to stop\nlearning at age fourteen—the\nlevel of commercial radio—as it is\nfor him to die at age fourteen.\nSince N. A. E. B. stations are owned\nby the people or by eleemosynary\ninstitutions, we felt compelled to\nbeam to the 30 per cent minority\nnot satisfied or served by com¬\nmercial radio. They are the under¬\nprivileged one-third. We con¬\ncluded that we must begin the\nexchange of resources to serve\nthem.”\nMr. Siegel appealed to Cooper\nUnion on its ninetieth anniversary\nto donate $1,000 worth of tape to\nrecord “Great Themes In the\nGreat Hall.” He got $600 worth\",\nand the program was mailed\naround the network. The system\nof using the tape and passing it\nalong was dubbed “bicycling.” The\nNew York Herald Tribune donated\n$420 worth of tape to record its\nForums, and another information\nprogram was circulated.\nA half hour daily was allowed\nby WNYC to service the network,\nbut the demand by the thirty-five\nstations for eight to ten hours of\nprograms weekly cut into the\nstudio’s work schedule by 30 per\ncent.\nIn 1951, the W. K. Kellogg\nFoundation, of Battle Creek, Mich.,\ngranted N. A. E. B. $245,000 for five\nyears. A headquarters was set up\nin the University of Illinois divi¬\nsion of communication. There, a\nstaff edits the programs, lifting\nthe burden from WNYC and the\nother stations. At first only twelve\ncopies of a tape could be made for\nthe “bicycle” trip around twelve\ngeographical circuits served by\nmember stations. Now, a mass du¬\nplicator runs off ten tapes at a\ntime.\nDuring 1950-’51, N. A. E. B. dis¬\ntributed 297 programs, comprising\nthirty series. Included were nine\nseries of music for ninety hours;\nfour of thirty-seven hours were\ndrama; one of six-and-a-half\nhours was children’s stories; ten of\nsixty-and-a-half hours were for¬\nums, and six of twenty-two-and-\na-half hours were documentaries.\n$300,000 Ford Grant\nThe boldest sprint by N. A. E. B.\nwas propelled by a $300,000 grant\nfrom the Fund for Adult Education\ntion established by the Ford Foun¬\ndation. N. A. E. B. produced a series\nof programs with paid talent. ‘‘The\nJeffersonian Heritage,” a thirteen-\nweek series will be broadcast on\nthe network in the fall.\n“The ‘Heritage’ was our test,”\nMr. Siegel said. “For the first time\nN. A. E. B. harnessed the intelli¬\ngence of the nation’s leading schol¬\nars for radio. We made the consult¬\nant king. We converted scholars\ninto radio producers. We killed\noff twenty top commercial writers\ntrying to recondition their stand¬\nards of twenty years, and we re¬\nconditioned composers to write the\nbridge music. Our product isn’t a\none-shot. It will be good in\ntwenty to fifty years.”\nN. A. E. B.’s complete pack¬\nage for fall provides six and a\nhalf hours weekly, three and a\nquarter hours of lectures, three-\nquarters hour for children, an\nhour of drama, and one and a\nhalf hours for music.\n“What’s the significance of\nthis?” Mr. Siegel asked and an¬\nswered his own question; “Well,\nwhen the Federal Communications\nCommission started1 hearings on\nallocating TV channels to educa¬\ntional institutions. N. A. E. B. was\nthe hub of action by educators. We\nworked together, raised $50,000 in\na professional fund drive, and\nhired Gen. Telford Taylor as coun¬\nsel to plead for us.\n“Never before have so few with\nso little overwhelmed so many. We\ngot more than we asked for from\nthe F. C. C., 242 channels, 12 per\ncent of those to be allocated. That\nmakes our future tasks greater.\nBut if N. A. E. B. keeps on asking\nhere and in Europe, the future is\nunlimited. We’ll be able to ride th<*\nbicycle network success into TV\nand reach a goal o_~ 500 horn's\nyearly on radio.”\nWORLD TELEGRAM,\nSEPTEMBER 26,1952\nhas sent secret\nmmissioners to\ne in future de¬\nfers favor Gov.\n‘sident 9 to 4.\nCommittee on\nirey is deep in\ns final report.\nHis Honor are\nrtain sections\nnterpreted as\nstration waste\n■'resident Jam<\ntalked up b;\nTHURSDAY SEPTEMBER 18 1952\nAMERICATOTAKE\nIT FROM HERE\nBy MARK JOHNS\nTAKE It From Here, one of Britain’s\ntop radio comedy shows, will try to\ntickle American as well as British audi¬\nences when the new series 'begins next\nyear.\nAmerica’s radio “school¬\nmaster,\" Mr. Seymour Siegel,\nwho has been searching for cul¬\ntural programmes over here,\nwill present Joy Nichols.

The B.B.C.\nis said to be “ enthusiastically considering ” a\nseries’of 13 half-hour broadcasts telling “ the\nJefferson story.” Both parties are thinking\nof using series of broadcasts setting out the\nfundamentals of each country’s foreign\npolicy.\nThe N.A.E.B. is interested in the “ Andy\nPandy ” television programme, and has in\nmind to commission films from the B.B.C.\nFilm Unit.\nThe National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters was founded in 1949. It has its\nheadquarters at the .University of Illinois and\noperates over 80 radio stations, all non¬\ncommercial. Its primary aim is to give the\nAmerican people more sound broadcasts and\ntelevision programmes of Third Programme\nstandard than, in the words of its president,\nMr. Seymour Siegel, “ the commercial stations\ncan reasonably be expected to produce.”\nU.S. SEEKS TY\nEXCHANGE\nCULTURAL FEATURES\nBv Our Radio Correspondent\nAmong B.B.C. programmes which\nhave impressed American educa¬\ntional broadcasters who are visitirlg\nthis country looking for material\nare the television puppet show for\nchildren “ Andy-Panay,” the tele¬\nvision iilm about Henry Moore and\nthe B.B.C. sound series “ Taking\nStock.” They want to transmit these\nprogrammes in America.\nThree delegates of the American\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters have just completed a\n10-day visit to the B.B.C. and have\nalso been guests of the broadcasting\norganisations in Paris, Rome and\nGeneva. The result of their tour\nwill be an increase in cultural broad¬\ncasting exchanges between the Old\nand New worlds.\nThe visitors are Mr. Seymour\nSiegel, president of N.A.E.B. and\ndirector of New York City’s muni¬\ncipal station W.N.Y.C.; Mr. George1\nProbst, director of radio and tele-1\nvision at the University of Chicago; j\nand Mr. William Harley, associate I\nprofessor of radio education at Wis¬\nconsin University and programme\ndirector of the Wisconsin State\nBroadcasting System.\nThey want to commission the\nB.B.C. to make 13 half-hour films\ndealing “ with the humanities.”\nThese, it is hoped, will have a peren¬\nnial value in American television\ntransmissions. The N.A.E.B. has\noffered the B.B.C. various recorded\nsound programmes, including an\nauthoritative series on Thomas\nJefferson.\nFormer Alderman Max Gross\nheads a new municipal affairs\ncommittee of the Bronx Bar\nAssn. The group is supposed to\nbe a watchdog over city govern¬\nment.\nSeymour Siegel, director of\nWNYC, has just returned from a\ntrip through Europe to negotiate\nexchange programs with Euro¬\npean radio execs."
