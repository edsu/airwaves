  "text": "Committee took further action in implementing an active distribution\nof programs designed for classroom use in elementary and secondary\nschools. This distribution is now a successful reality*\nTHE OPERATION\nAt this writing the network is still required to operate\non a '’bicycle’* basis. The equipment, tapes, and personnel made\npossible by the Kellogg grant have permitted expanding this opera¬\ntion to a maximum degree. However, optimum service is not possible\nunder a ”leg-bicycle” system. There are too many possibilities of\nshipping errors, delays in the mail, and actual losses of tapes.\nExperience indicates that the most effective operation is a direct\ntwo-way service wherein each station is supplied directly from head¬\nquarters with its own copies of all programs. This is possible only\nwith a machine capable of duplicating tapes in mass volume. Such\na machine is now contracted for and will be installed no later\nthan July 1, 1952. Starting with the programs to be issued in\nSeptember, 1952, each station will receive its own copy of all\nprograms, and the network will achieve the operating efficiency\ntoward which it has been striving*\nThe network has acquired approximately 5*200 reels of\nrecording tape. This quantity has made possible the continually\nexpanding service. Tape supply has been one of the major chronic\nproblems. This situation has not changed. With the advent of\ndirect headquarters-station service the need for tapes will be in¬\ncreased. The only alternative to an increased tape s upply is a re¬\nduction in the volume of programming distributed. At this time it\nis anticipated that approximately 10,000 reels of tape will be\nneeded to keep the network operating at peak efficiency*"
