Scott Fletcher, President\nFund for Adult Education\n914 East Green Street\nPasadena 1, California\nDear Mr. Fletcher:\nThe National Congress of Parents and Teachers, an organization of\nalmost eight million men and women interested in the welfare of all\nchildren, is much concerned with the impact of television. Use of\ntelevision in the school is a problem which is being presented to\nus more and more often.\nOften we are asked if we approve of the use of television m the\nclassrooms; if we approve of local P.T.A.'s purchasing TV equipment.\nAlways our reply has been to the effect that while we recognize the\neducational value of television, we feel it necessary that teachers\nunderstand and favor its use; that they have the needed training to\nuse it adequately in the classroom. Nothing can destroy a positive attiÂ¬\ntude on the part of the public more quickly than inefficient or\nwasteful use of the medium. Unless teachers are given such preparation,\nthey cannot be criti ised for their lack of acceptance or competence\nin use of TV.\n<\nDr. Belmont Farley, the representative of the National Education\nAssociation on the Joint Committee on Educational Television, has\nShown me the NEA application for funds to begin a service to teachers\nand administrators in educational television. This proposed project\nseems to be timely and needed. It will supplement the efforts of\norganizations already active in the field. Through membership of the\nNEA and the affiliated Stqte branches it will be available m all\nsections of our country, to teachers from every area of activity.\nWe trust that you will consider this project favorably and assist\niq initiating such service to teachers and thereby indirectly bene-\nfitting all children.\nSincerely yours,\nMrs. Newton-P. Leonard, President\nNational Congress of Parents and Teachers"
