C. 20036\nDear Mary Ann,\nThank you for your letter of April 9* I appreciate Bill's confidence\nand regret that I haven't had time so far to study the problem of\nadditional committee members for the Public Relations Committee.\nPlease don't replace any of last year's members automatically since\nmost of them were \"do nothings.\" Would you please tell me which of\nthe members will be automatically going off the Committee? Then I can\nsuggest some names to you for replacements.\nI would like to suggest Leontine Keane, Birector of Radio-TV Publicity\nfor Wayne State University, Detroit, as one additional member for the\ncoming year. I'll be in touch with you on other names as soon as I\nhear from you. Meantime,\nAll the best.\nMarion Corvell\nAssociate Director\nMC/hjk"
