Becker\nDivision of Television, Radio, Film\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nIt is always nice to hear from you. Thanks especially for\nthe note on statistics. It doesn't sound like a thing I would do,\nbut I'll look up the article and the calculations and see whether\nI should hang my head or argue. I appreciate very much your writing\nabout it.\nBut let me hasten to respond to your note about the breakfast.\nAre you sure I'm on that committee? I have no record of anyone asking\nme to be, or of accepting. And whereas I would do most anything for\nNAEB or you, still on October 24 I am supposed to be speaking to the\nUnesco National Commission's Africa conference in Boston.\nCan I be of any help at long distance? I don't know exactly\nwhat that committee does, but with a vigorous chairman it ought to\nhave a vigorous program. Good luckl\nWith best wishes, I am\nSincerely yours\n--A\nMTbur Schramm\nDirector"
