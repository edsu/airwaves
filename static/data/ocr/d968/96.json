(20036)\nDear Sir:\nRE: Pastore Sub-Committee Hearing\n1, You are to be commended for your testimony for the Pastore Sub-Committee\n(which I just saw last night). (I had previously written them that I thought ed¬\nucational radio broadcasting could do as good or better than half the ETV I have\nseen so far and cost a heck of a lot less.) 1 have been a bit involved in educa¬\ntional broadcasting since helping to build and operate two educational radio\n(University) stations about 40 years ago-so I can appreciate your interest and\nproblems.\n2. Since I serve on several school board and industry study groups, from local to\nnational level, I would like to have you send me any conveniently available material\non the operation of your group, and what is now being done on educational radio\nin the United States; and also a copy of your submitted material to the Pastore\ncommittee if available.\n3, Even tho it does not all agree with the NAEB position, I am sending you a copy\nof some response to FCC dockets 14185, 14229, and 16453. You might be interested\nin a school board member's thinking on Docket 14185.\n4. Again, thanks for pulling for educational radio. Remember Harry Skornia’s\ncomment about TV putting a nation to sleep and radio waking them up.\nLloyd P. Morris\nLPM/em\ncc enclosed"
