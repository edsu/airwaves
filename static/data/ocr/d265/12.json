Wladimir Belinsky has provided an eminently helpful score...and Frank Pappus\ndirection is plain and knowing.” (Jack Gould, New York Times, Sept. 15, 19£)\n“The Jeffersonian Heritage” is a 13-week half-hour series dealing with the life,\ntimes, principles and philosophy of Thomas ^efferson* However, its purpose is nob\nbiographical, but rather to show how Jeffersonian ideals have guided generations of\nAmerican statesment up to the present day. In line with this aid, the initial pro¬\ngram, 'The Living Declaration,* reviewed, spotlighted Jefferson's part in writing of\nDeclaration of Independence*\n\"The entire ©ries is based on the research, writing and advice of Professor\nDumas Hfelone, of Columbia University.....Producer-director, Frank Papp, has show¬\ncased the professor’s material in laudable fadtion, with Vladimir Belinsky’s majes¬\ntic background music particularly impressive. However, major credit for the series®\nsuccess belongs to actor Claude Rains.....\n\"The first show in the series registered maximum audience impact, via Jeffer¬\nson 5 a vain attempt to have an anti-slavery clause written in the Constitution and\nRainA1 convincing explanation of Jefferson13 tolerant religious views.”\n(June Bundy, Billboard, Sept. 20, 1952)\n^Radio's evaluation of Thomas Jefferson’s contributions to the free world—the\nhighly touted series produced by the National Assn, of Educational Broadcasters un¬\nder a grant from the Ford Foundation—got away to an impressive start (Sunday, Sept.\n14), to suggest that this series will have steady, and sharpened impact*\n”A little pretentious and self-conscious in its scripting at the very start,\nthe premiere program got into proper dramatic focus very soon, however, by virtue\nof its subject matter and Claude Rains’ fine performance as Jefferson. The meat\nand sincerity in this program, the easy though .serious way in which it was presented\nas veil as the sterling quality of the acting performances, type this as a highly\nimportant series. It should be 'must1 listening for adults as well as all schoolrooms.\n\"Program was a combined narration-draisatisation format, which had drama, bite,\nand vigor.\" (Variety, Sept. 17, 1952)\n\"Hie NAEB should be mighty proud of the job producer Frank Papp and his staff\ndid on their ’Ref-fens onian Heritage* series. The quality of production and script\nare radio at its almost forgotten best—reminiscent of the glorious days of the\nold Columbia Workshop....\" (Ted Green, Radio Daily, Oct. 21, 1952)"
