Well, for such a fine American woman, brought up with certain\nnotions of propriety to whisk at once into a waltz5 to brave the just\nsentiments of the delicate members of her own sex, and of the other sex\n(that3s you and me, Mr. Beaumont, and Mr. Tocqueville, too, when he8s\nthrough with his journal): people with whom she8s been brought up and\nwith whom she continues to associate, well, it does very little credit\nto her good sense, her delicacy, or her morals. Every woman knows or\nought to know that she cannot exhibit herself in the whirling and\nlascivious windings of a waltz, without calling up the minds of men,\nfeelings and associations, unworthy of the dignity and purity of a delicate\nfemale. The lascivious motions, the up-turned eyes, the die-away\nlangours, the dizzy circlings, the twining arms, and projecting front,\nall combine to waken in the bosom of the spectators (that*s you and\nme, Mr. Beaumont, and Mr. Tocqueville, when ha8s through pen-pushing)\nanalogies, associations and passions, which no woman who values the\nrespect of the world, ought every wilfully to challenge or excite.\nI agree: in principle.\nTo say nothing of the fact, (and I tell you in confidence, it is undoubted)"
