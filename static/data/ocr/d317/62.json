Sulser, Director\nRadio and ^television Oaiammieatlc^\nIndiana university\nBlooaington, Indiana\ntear Bromo:\nI Bftttat to discuss vith you, at the time of the Region XII meeting in Chicago,\na couple or the points you raised In your letter of tereh 8, to Jim Milos -\nregarding the f&ct that apparently your staff members were ignored not only\nvhen the Region III progam was drawn up, but also when the BAEB ccsssitteas\nwere appointed.\nAs am who has served long and itelthfully as chteraaa of some of HAHD‘a “toughest,r\ncommittees, I think you know how they are appointed. Xhere are several considera¬\ntions, of course. la the first place, to be appointed to an MSB ccesaittee a\nperson needs to be either an Individual member of the Association, or the official\ncontact person from a member institution (in the case of the network ccsamittees,\n5S£Hf5fe. contact persons may be appointed).

Sfcese contacts arc usually\nmade at HAEB regional and national meetings, oik! you said that few of your people\ncame to our aeetlngs most of the time.\nI hope you will interstate that I m not trying to make excuses, but «w-»wiy\ntrying to explain a rather oomplesc situation, with which you are vexy familiar*\nI hope that if you feel that any of your staff are particularly qualified to"
