Seymour Siegel\nAllen Miller\nBurton Paulu\nDick Hull\nFrank Schooley\nWilbur Schramm\nGentlemen:\nIn light of several conversations and communi¬\ncations of recent date concerning the search for a new\nExecutive Director, I should like to summarize our position\nat this time and ask for guidance frcci this group.\nIN REFERENCE TO EARL WYNN - All of the responses\nwhich we have had concerning him, with one exception, hav<\nbeen highly complimentary and most favorable every\nmember of the above group has indicated belief that Wynn\nis our best candidate and that we shou34jnake him an offer\nof this job. The one negative comment([considered by the\nperson who received it confidentially-A\n!8\nnot of sufficient\nimportance to make him change his mind. This negative\ncomment raised the question of Earl’s organizational ability.\nI had one confidential letter from a man who has worked\nwith him ever since he went to North Carolina saying that\nseveral years ago Earl had one unpleasant staff situation\narise, but felt that that was a valuable lesson for Wynn\nand that he was a better man as a result of it. ^11 of\nthe communications have indicated that Wynn is doing a\nspectacular job at North Carolina and that North Carolina\ncan ill afford to lose him - and that leads to iry second\npoint concerning him. Vtynn is still interested in the\nNAEB proposal, but I gather that there is less certainty\nthat he will accept our proposal than there was at the\ntime when we first approached him.\nThis further obviates the urgency of a meeting\nwith Earl prior to the Minneapolis meeting and points up\na second fact. We must continue to trace references on\nother people and look for new possibilities in the event\nWynn does not accept our offer.\nAllen raised the subject of Tom Rishworth as a\npossible candidate in a recent communication with me, and\nGail Adkins at jris* Radio House at the University of Texas\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
