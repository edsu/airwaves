  "text": "NAEB Options\n-3\n4. Heavy dependency on contract with TOP with no guarantee\nsuch contract funds will be continued.\n5. Possibility that TOP would sooner or later undertake\nsome or all of NAEB services itself, thus usurping our\nfunctions and removing a principal source of income.\nOption B - Merger\nPros:\n1. Advantage of being part of a new single unified system;\nbe on the inside, one of the family, with approval of\nFord, Congress, lay governing board group, etc.\n2. Be attached to the power structure with possibility of\n..sharing in power.\n3. Have the opportunity of influencing from the inside -\nproviding leadership in professional concerns broader than\nTV station interests and countering trade association attitudes\n4. Be part of a broad constituency organization, with\nconsequent political and fiscal advantages.\n5. Have a base that affords relatively greater fiscal\nviability and the possibility for better and expanded\nsupport beyond the level, yet attained; hence the\nlikelihood of higher quality and enlarged service.\n6. Merge now with maximum possibilities for transferring\nstaff and obtaining whatever benefits derive from being\nin at the start, of being a \"charter member\" of the\nnew group.\n7. After 18 months, there is provirion for orderly\nmodification of board structure and the chance of\nobtaining professional representation at the policy\nlevel.\n8. Can pull out later if the merger doesn't work.\nCons:\n1. ^^eompels the c^l^olving of a 43-year-old corporation with\na long tr^^tion of independence and record of achievement."
