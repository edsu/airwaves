NEW YORK\nDear Mr. Underwood:\nUnder the auspices of the Church Peace Union, I have produced a\nseries of three complete half-hour dramatic radio programs. The purposes\nof these programs called A TIME TO REMEMBER is to use the medium of true\npersonal dramas to influence the general public in applying the common teachings\nof the world's great religions as set forth in the enclosed pamphlet.\nThe completed programs are based on the lives of Carl Sandburg,\nDanny Kaye and Justice William C. Douglas. At the end of each program, the\nprotagonist comments on the impact his experience had in his life and the wisdom\nto be derived from it. The necessary clearances have been obtained in all cases.\nThe Church Peace Union believes these programs far surpass the\naverage dramatic radio program in listener appeal as well as quality and are\neminently suited for broadcast by the NAEB network. I am therefore enclosing\nthe scripts of these programs for your consideration.\nThe Church Peace Union will offer these programs without cost for\ndistribution by NAEB. If you are interested, I will forward the tapes to your\noffice.\nAny consideration you may give to this proposal will be very much\nappreciated.\nDirector of Public Relations\nMr. Robert E. Underwood, Jr.\nNetwork Manager\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois"
