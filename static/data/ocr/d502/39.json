LOUIS 5, MISSOURI\nVClunteer 3 - 0995.\nJanuary 6, 1954\nMr. Harry Skornia,\nExecutive Director,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters ,\n119 Gregory Hall,\nUniversity of Illinois,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nDear Harry t\nPardon the delay in answering your December 21 letter. Part of\nit was occasioned by waiting until Morris Novlk came out here earlier this\nweek to see what he might have to say about our situation. (He was sent\nby NCCET and JCET).\nAs I wrote in my letter to Morris several weeks ago (a copy of\nwhich you received) the situation in St. Louis is rather critical, at\nleast in comparison with other cities. St. Louis is a hot union town and\nI gather that the IBEW local here is out to gather us into its fold. MorrlÂ©\ncams here to meet with me, one of our Commissioners, and a lawyer who was\nformerly with the HLRB regionally and nationally. I think he got a good\nflU<*in of our picture. He believes that something has to be worked out\nnationally. How successfully he can accomplish this I have no way of\nestimating.\nI think it would be a very good idea if you held the meeting you\nmentioned, and I can make it most any date you set. January 21, 22 or 23\nis fine. Meanwhile, may I suggest that you send urgent letters to such\npeople as Bill Wood in Pittsburgh, Sener in L. A. , Schwarawalder in Houston,\nMcCarty in Madison, Neeley in Cincinnati, plus the appropriate people in\nDetroit, Chicago, Boston, and Hunter at East Lansing and Garrison at Ann\nArbor and find out what their union problems are if any. If we could have\nthis information handy for the January meeting it would help us plan strategy\nbetter, for each city has a somewhat different labor picture I suspect.\nBe waiting to hear from you.\nBest regards,\n/a/ Dick\nRichard J.
