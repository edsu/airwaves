For that's\nwhat it is.. .and that's all it is. A purveyor of sounds and sights\nwhich originate outside this box. Television cannot introduce\nitself. It cannot hear. It cannot feel. It cannot think. I want\nyou to remember that. And I want you to remember something else.\nSomething very important in your relationship to this device in\nthe classroom. Television, itseif, cannot teach... though it\nmay be used as a channel for teaching. And television cannot\nlearn., .though it may be used as a resource or instrument to\nmotivate, to stimulate, to facilitate learning.\nWhy am I being so insistent about this? Because all too often...\nwhen television appears in the classroom...\nSuddenly the television receiver is in a classroom."
