  "text": "President, NAEB\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI am enclosing a verifax copy of portions of the Radio-Television-\nFilm Interest Group, Speech Association of America News Letter,\nwhich appears to me to call for some polling of our membership as\nto reactions, since I think it is likely to have a serious and deliterious\neffect on the relationship of educational broadcasters with commercial\nbroadcasters. You will note that the paragraph I have singled out on\nthe first page of this, indicates that this entire group was from Indiana\nUniversity and the NAEB representative from Indiana, of course, was\nnot present. How this small group felt that it could speak for the Speech\nAssociation of America completely baffles me.\nI would point out that the introduction to this document is very nearly\nas intemperate a statement on the whole situation as has been enunci¬\nated so far. While I am not in favor of educators squabbling publicly\nover points of view, I think it needs to be made very clear, by those of\nus who have some appreciation of the complexities of this problem and\nsome interest in the development of mutually beneficial relationships\nbetween commercial and educational broadcasters, that we disassociate\nourselves from any such position as this ad hoc committee from Indiana\nUniversity has taken.\nIt appears to me singularly ironic that this document should contain a\nrecommendation that the Commission support directly and encourage\ncommercial broadcasters to support the educational broadcasting move¬\nment. I can think of very little that has been done, or said, recently\nthat will contribute less to this goal than the Auer statement.\nRFS:eb\nend\ncopy to NAEB Board members"
