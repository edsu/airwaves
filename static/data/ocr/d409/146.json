  "text": "Tele-Guiding by the Teacher\nrJphe “Tele-Digests” enclosed, contain the\ncontent upon which the individual pro¬\ngrams are based. This information will permit\nteachers to discuss the programs with their classes\nbefore the TV presentation as well as afterwards.\nrJ^eachers will see many different ways in which the programs can serve the\ninterests and needs of their classes. However, each class and situation is\nunique so the suggestions made here are designed to be idea-provoking rather than\nspecifically applicable to an age level or a subject field.\nSuggestions For Class Discussion\nBefore Seeing the Program:\nBecause teachers, through the content in the tele-digests, have advance information\non what the programs are going to be, they should be careful not to take the edge of\ninterest off by letting their classes know the program plan. However, a general dis¬\ncussion of the particular program can be carried on which will direct class viewing,\nsharpen attention and appreciation, and upgrade evaluation of TV programs. Put\nthe name of the program, the station and time for showing on the chalk board.\n• What do you know about this subject now?\n• What content do you think the program will contain?\n• How do you think the presentation will be worked out? Live action,\ncamera reporting of real incidents, animation,—how—?\n• Watch for new ideas and information. If there are things you\ndon9t understand remember what they are and perhaps we can\nclarify them tomorrow.\nThis Tele-Guide has been prepared by Mrs. Margaret Divizia, Supervisor\nin Charge, Audio-Visual Section, Los Angeles City Schools.\nCopyright 1955 Walt Disney Productions\nAll Rights Reserved Printed in U.
