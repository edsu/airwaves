The PR Committee\ndid not have a second meeting, since I could see no develope-\nmenta that required it. However, you might be interested in\nknowing that Marion and I taxied over to the big city and had\na nice interview with Sol Taishoff, Editor of BROADCASTING.\nWe also met his Managing Editor, Art King. From these gentle¬\nmen, Marion and I derived some very good ''backgrounds\" which\nwould stand us in good stead.\nI want to congratulate you on getting on the ball so promptly\nin the matter of seeking funds for the PR grant for MAEB. I\nhave not yet received from Marion the minutes of our meeting,\nwhich will be distributed to our committee membership as well\nas Headquarters. As a result. Headquarters my not know of\nour interests in this area, and there is still a chance that\nfor some reason unknown to us, this activity may conflict with\nsomething that our boys in Washington are already working on.\nFor this reason, I am writing Harley today as yon will note\nfrom the attached copy; and I would suggest that you continue\nto make your plans in this matter but do net execute them un¬\ntil we get the green light from our NAEB Great White Father.\nHope everything is going well with you in the sunny South.\nFor your information, I still have the laryngitis which seems\nto be delightful to the other members of our staff — not to\nmention my classes.\nEGStvs\ncos Miss Marion Cornell\nRadio and Television Communications\n•. William Harley"
