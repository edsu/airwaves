Hull\nOhio State University\nColumbus, Ohio\nDear Dick:\nI am in complete agreement that we should\nnot officially endorse HR 7082.\nIf such a Citizensâ€™ Commission were to\nbe established, I wouldn't want NAEB or\nits officers identified with it. I don t\nknow in what other areas such commissions\nexist, but I do not think this is the way\nfor either Congress or the FCC to acquire\ninformation.\nThese people -- congressmen or FCC staffers --\nare either elected or employed to exercise\nthe r judgments, and they should not hide\nbehind, or pass the responsibility on to\nothers who have no opportunity to implement\ntheir decisions.\nBest regards.\nLoren B.
