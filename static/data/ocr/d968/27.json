McCarthy\nMarch 8, 1967\nFor these reasons, ten of the Minnesota private colleges have asked\nthe F.C.C. to reserve FM channels for the establishment of a Minnesota\neducational radio network.\nThis proposed network can only be established and supported with the\naid of the Public Television Act of 1967. Our broadcasting efforts at\nSt. John's could increase substantially in effect and quality with the\nsupport outlined in this legislation.\nI hope that you will agree with us, in evaluating the merit of this\nbill when it is introduced and give it your full support.\nSincerely,\nColman J. Barry, O.S.B.\ndb\nend."
