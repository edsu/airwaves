It may be necessary to estalish new schools and new types\nof schools such as two-year technical or semi-professional schools. Careful\nattention should be given to the location of new schools® It is well known that\na large portion of those who drop out of college do so during the first or second\nyear* With this in mind* it mi$it be well to establish any new colleges in centers\nof population where the potential students are living* Practically every dormitory\nroom in the United States is now filled* If colleges could be located in centers\nwhere students could commute* much additional expense for housing and feeding\ncould be avoided. Students could then live at home/1 begin their college education,\nchoose their educational and vocational objectives* and then* if Qualified* continue\non into the established four-year colleges and universities. This plan should\nbring enou^i students into these advanced and graduate classes so that enrollment\nin each class would be sufficient to justify its continuance* At the same time* it\nwould provide the opportunity for practically all capable students to attend a\ncollege or university* Parenthetically* it mi git be mentioned that when twice as\nmany children were bom last year as were born twenty-two years ago* twice as many\nbright ones were born and now only a little over one half of the upper quarter of\nour high school graduates are continuing on into college* Potentially* then* we\ncould more than double our present enrollment and maintain our present high\nacademic standards. Current trends indicate that this will be done within twenty\nyears.\nThe problem is* then* rather clearly placed before us. We now know the\nprobable number of students to be enrolled in our colleges and universities and\nwe know the time of their coming* It is now our responsibility to make preparation\nfor their coming* One obvious solution to the problem would be to double or treble\nour present physical facilities within the next twenty years* Intelligent planning\nand self discipline should make it possible to meet our developing needs without\nthe necessity of this tremendous expenditure of money and materials* The following\nprocedures are then suggested.\nFirst* we can unquestionably realize a better utilization of our present\nphysical facilities. This can be done by more uniform scheduling of classes\nthroughout the day and week.\nSecond* we can offer fewer courses eliminating the excessive number of small\nclasses and combine those courses now taugit one* two* or three times a week into\nlarger units of instruction scheduled five times a week.\nThird* new schools and new types of schools can be established to supplement\nour present system of higier education. Care should be used in the location of\n■these colleges to assure their placement in centers of population where no colleges\nare now operating.\nFourth* better cooperation can be realized among the many junior colleges*\nfour-year colleges* and universities in order that we may develop a truly integrated\nsystem of hi^ier education® This will require at least statewide planning and\nperhaps regional planning* These are only a few suggested procedures and devices\n\"which can be used in the years ahead.\nBy careful planning and action based on clear vision* I am confident we shall\nbe able to make adequate preparation for the added millions of youth now coming\nthrough our elementary and secondary schools in order that they may be given the\nsame high-quality educational opportunities it was our good fortune to enjoy."
