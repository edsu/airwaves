Harriet Beecher Stowe\nHowever, some stations find it difficult or impossible to use sub¬\nstitutes. Therefore, we have asked the originating station, WNYE, to\nsupply us with new copies of the fgur. ortPimUy. ggfrefliflaLpEggrSTOP.\nMoreover, if you will compare the list of substitute programs with\nthe original list, you vil3 note—as we have—that two of the substi-\ntues which we have received—24. Elias Howe, and 28. Harriet Beecher\nStowe—are on the original list and are not substitutes at all, but\n\"repeats.\"\nNevertheless, we shall send (on one tape) the Sarah Winnemucca and\nthe Donald McKay programs—as well as the originally scheduled programs—\nfor those who can use them. They will be numbered 31 and 32.\nI hope the above is clear and helpful information. Believe me,\nwe too are caught off base by tapes which turn out to be engineering\nduds and by \"substitutes\" which turn out to be repeats.\nWe sent out the first eight tapes last spring. Five of the seven\nremaining tapes were sent to some stations this summer and will be sent\nto the rest this week. The Winnemucca and McKay programs will be sent\nto all stations this week. We shall send the remaining two tapes to\nall stations as soon as we receive them here—we hope ear3y in September.\nSincerely,\n^ohn Holt\nNetwork Manager"
