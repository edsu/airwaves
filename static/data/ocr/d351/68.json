(Leaving the rabble rousers for other types\nof broadcasting stations.)\n• How about remembering to plug your station, your insti¬\ntution, and your own shows on the air?\n• If the news service people at your institution want to push\na particular campus anniversary, open house, graduation, or\nwhatnot, do you willingly push with them?\n• Have you learned how to resist pressures for announcements\nand programs that would injure your station image, yet still\nleave the persons wanting such things in a good humor ?\n(Takes patience, but it’s worth it.)\n• And have you clearly defined the image you are striving to\nperfect for your station?\nMost audiences tuning in to a given station are potential friends of that\nstation . . . and friends are something than which there is nothing nicer."
