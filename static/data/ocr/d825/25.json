Tettemer\nDirector of School Program Department\nOCA-TV\n1640 Como Avenue\nSt. Paul 13, Minnesota\nDear Clair:\n1 have a copy of the outlines which were developed at the Advisory\nCommittee meeting and think they aee presented in good form to\nelicit helpful comments. I would prefer that Gertrude’s name and mine\nnot be associated any further with the direct relationship to specific\nsections of the project. This, of course, Is not because we don’t want\nto be associated with it, but there is always the possibility of some\nembarrassment if persons who are primarily concerned with liaison are\ntoo directly involved in the conduct of the project.\nI would like to suggest that the May 4-5 meeting be moved up about a\nweek to coincide with the National Conference on Instructional Tele¬\nvision which has been scheduled for May 13, 14, and 15 at the\nUniversity of Illinois. If this does not conflict with anything else you\nhave scheduled, there seems to be a value in relating it to that meeting\nsomehow - perhaps by meeting on the week-end of the ilth and 12th,\nor by holding sessions in conjunction with the Conference itself. I\nthink you are in the best position to decide which of these alternatives\nis most satisfactory.\nSincerely,\nJames A. Fellows\nJAFivsc\nbcc: Gertrude Broderick\nHarold Hill"
