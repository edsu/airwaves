I should be very grateful for your confidential reaction to\nthe points raised, as well as any suggestions you mpy have for people.\nI assure you your letter will be kept strictly confidential, unless you\nwish it to be otherwise.\nI shall talk to Bob VanDuyn as soon as X can catch him to let him\nknow where we stand aid to get his reaction to some of the problems raised\nin this letter.\nA rehash of all of the matters which we discussed by telephone last\nSaturday is not necessary. I should like to repeat, however, that the\nsentiments expressed in the letter we discussed were a reflection of only\none personâ€™s views aid his thinking was changed considerably at the Ames\nmeeting. I am genuinely sorry that it happened and can assure you there\nwill be no repetition of that or of the situation that developed at\nBattle Creek. The one other point I should like to raise is that of your\nrelationship between N/EB and the Kellogg Foundation. I sincerely hope that\nyou will change your mind about letting someone else do this job which you\nhave done magnificently. This is the feeling of every member of the Board.\nThe same is true of the permanence of the Headquarters operation at the\nUniversity of Illinois. The one change of the Executive Director is enough.\nFurther changes would be psychologically very harmful to the organl zation.\nHgr very kindest regards always.\nSincerely yours.\nGA/ns\nenc.\nGmydon /usmus, iixeetor\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nVice-President, HAEB"
