It is May the eleventh, eighteen thirty\none; and on the deck of the President, having just come down from New¬\nport, there stand two young men; both well dressed after a rather\nquiet European fashion; both have long dark hair, in the fashion of\nthe day: both have eager darting eyes; although both seem very tired\n(they have been without sleep for some time).

This young man, wearing a cloak, is\ntwenty nine.
