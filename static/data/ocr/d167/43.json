  "text": "Mrs. Betty McKenzie\n2\nApril 8, 1963\nsuch a seminar contiguous to the Institute for Education by\nRadio-Television in Columbus but a vote showed only five\nfelt they could make it at that time and place. There was a\ncertain amount of enthusiasm for such a meeting tempered with\nconcern over the agenda. The feeling was that it ought to be\nwell planned with papers prepared beforehand and a publication\nto come out of it.\n4. An informal vote indicated that 90% of those in attendance would\nbe willing to contribute as much as $300 in increased dues so\nthat NAEB could provide a comprehensive national service for\nradio - i. e., personnel to work on improved national programming\nand on improving and selling a positive image of educational\nradio to ourselves, to our administrations and to the public at\nlarge. It was pointed out, however, that while the money might\nbe available, budgeting it would require some careful preparation\nin terms of rational* and manner of billing. It was also pointed\nout that it would also have to be a graduated fee structure.\nI hope Ken will write you separately since I am sure his analysis will be\nexcellent. He did a superb job of keeping the discussion live and moving\nas chairman of the radio sessions.\nO. Leonard Press\nHead\nOLP/pah\ncc: Ken Wright\nH.B.
