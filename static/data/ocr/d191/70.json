Ifeh of the credit for the Net¬\nwork operation must also go to those committees* for the principal task of the Network\nHeadquarters personnel is simply to coordinate and distribute in tte best possible\nmanner the programs and series selected fey certain of the committees and to act on\nthe good advice of the ©there\nBetween the 1953 and the 1954. Conventions the Network Manager has met at least once\nwith each of three committees* the Network Acceptance committee9 the In-School Program\nCommittee* and the In*-School Program Subcommittee ,, He will have at least one or two more\nsuch meetings at the 1954 Convention. In the course of these meetings *nd of corres¬\npondence^ not every problem which might arise was solved,-, of course; but more workable\nrelationships end procedures wera developed„ and* Network Headquarters believes* a common\nunderstanding of the problems involved in our mutual interests arrived at.\nSince the last convention* the Network Headquarters has received—up to the time\nof this writing—from various organisations including member stations* member produc¬\ntion units« and various outside agencies—24 siiteifeissl^n® for the In-Scahool Program\nCommittee and 108 submissions for the Network Acceptance Committee,- The audition\ntapes accompanying these submissions were duplicated and copies sent* together with\nforme and/or other information* to the proper committee members* Headquarters also\nconducted a survey on in-school program preferences for the In-School Program Committee.\nWe would also like to mention several other committees the work of which more\ndirectly than most affects the Network operation. The International Relations\nCommittee has throughout the year placed a number of fine series in the Headquarters\noffice in plenty of time for their scheduled distribution• At the request of Network\nHeadquarters,, the Engineering Committee has issued a bulletin designed to help raise\nthe quality of the master tapes of Network programs and has investigated the properties\nof various brands of recording tape with a view to their possible use in the Network\noperation. Fortunately* the chairman of the Radio Planning Committee has been\nreadily at hand when his advice was needed* and several matters in his area were turned\nover to his committee. And perhaps we need not add that nothing of any critical\nsignificance has been done without due consultation with the Executive and/or Associate\nDirectors of the Association•\nThe general emphasis of the Network Headquarters operation has during this past\nyear undergone considerable change. Less weight is put on the «maas operation3*\naspect of the project and more on \"personal serviceHeadquarters work assignments\nhave been rearranged and more man-hours are eiloted to individual problems and to\nthe paper work and organisational work thus engendered. In the future9 we hope to\nincrease this \"personal service** emphasis still further.\nThis change in organisation and advance in operation is made possible largely\nfey the acquisition of a second mass duplicator and also, at no cost to the NAEB*\nof some seventy disk cabinets. The Headquarters office space remains overly crowded\nand the Network still uses only four and a half to five workers, but the new equip¬\nment gives us far greater flexibility."
