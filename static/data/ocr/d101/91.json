Becker, Director\nDivision of Television-Radio-Film\nState University of IOwa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nThank you for your invitation to appear at the session\non radio research at the NAEB meeting. This is a subject\nof great interest to me, and I would be pleased and honored\nto accept if I were to be in Detroit.\nI’m afraid, though, that I won!t be able to get to the\nconvention this year. There’s still an outside chance, but\nat the moment it seems highly unlikely.\nI realize you have been handed a big job on short no¬\ntice, and would be willing to help out with the next best\nthing if you wish. If Ed Adams’ health permits, he will\nrepresent our school at the convention. He has agreed to\nread a 15-20 minute report along the lines you suggested in\nyour letter. If Ed is unable to be present, I’m sure we’ll\nstill have someone in attendance who could present the\nreport•\nI’m enclosing a copy of a paper read last year as a\nsample of the sort of thing I have in mind—although I\nthink the NAEB talk would be modified considerably.\n-Please let me know as soon as possible if you wish\nort of substitute arrangement. I’m sorry not be able\nept the original invitation.\nSincerely,\nKen Kager\nOperations Manager\nEnclosure"
