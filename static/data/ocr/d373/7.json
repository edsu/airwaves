INDIANA\nJuly 30, 1968\nMr. Ken Clark\nProject Director\nRadio Programs for the Disadvantaged\nNational Educational Radio\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\"We are very interested in the 19 6 8 Urban Broadcasting Work¬\nshop to be held at American University. We would like to\nhave more information on the Workshop through this newslet-\nter in the hope that we can plan and sponsor such a work- /\nshop next summer at -Purdue/ _. _/\nWBAA's contribution to programming for the disadvantaged is\nin the planning stage at present. We are working on the\nprogramming ideas with the Purdue University advisor to\nblack students and the chairman of the local Human Relations\nCouncil. These people have told us they are.exhausted by\ndiscussion of- the problems of being a Negro in Lafayette\nor elsewhere. They have \"asked that we present programs\nthat will give solutions to the problems. However, we can¬\nnot, in whatever programming we present, limit our defini¬\ntion of \"disadvantaged” to mean \"Negro.\" Lafayette has a\nsmall Negro community but a much larger group of very poor\npeople* For this reason we are interested in program ideas\nwith a broader base.\nSpecific problems that seek solutions include home owner¬\nship, buying on credit and the training of what are presently\nthe unemployable. We are also interested in putting city\nofficials on the air with the opportunity for anyone to.\ncall in questions, problems and comments. We are planning\nfuture meetings with members of the Human Relations Council\nto begin work on some of these programsiaeas, and hope¬\nfully, many others.\nSincerely,\nJane Root\nTHE VOICE OF\nPUB9UE\nJR/cc"
