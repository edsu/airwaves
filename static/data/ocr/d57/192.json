And the im¬\npulse which drives mankind to seek security is as\nfundamental as inhaling and exhaling — the im¬\npulse to live. That is why political demagogues\nthroughout history have been able to gain power\nand control people with promises of economic\nsecurity. The interrelated aspects of freedom and\nsecurity are emphasized in this film which gives the\nquestion-answering job to the students in Dr.\nGanus’ “American Adventure” class. The instructor\nhandles the flannelboard cards while the class builds\nits list of the factors in genuine security — factors\nwhich come from within the person, and factors of\nan exterior nature but over which the people have\ncontrol. A third list is built — of factors destructive\nto security.\nAbove: The class has built three lists of factors in the estab¬\nlishment of genuine personal security—the last list being the\ndestructive factors, and now Professor Ganus is pointing up the\nlessons learned."
