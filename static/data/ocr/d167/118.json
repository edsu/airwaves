Marshall\nStatic®\nChicago Board of Education\n2SS North LaSalle Street\nChicago 1, Illinois\nLear List\nVe have been going over, with Raymond Hurlbert and Bill\nHarley, plans far the Region II meeting in Atlanta April\nIS. This discussion followed our going over our \"books\"\nto see what budget was available. So far we’ve been able\nto allow only a very small amount per regional meeting for\nthe three meetings held this year.\nMuch to Raymond’s sadness, which I share, w© are having to\nstick within that budget for this meeting as well. This\nleaves us nothing with which to pay for bringing in outside\nspeakers, without depleting the kitty to such an extent\nthat other planned features (a dinner \"on NAEB\" for example)\nwould have to be cancelled.\nI know Raymond felt badly about this, having inquired about\nyour availability in case funds ware available, and I’m\nwriting as the villain, which I must so often bet the guy\nwho says \"no money,* We wanted you to know that was the\nonly reason and that we are resolved that in the near\nfuture again, we shall be calling on you, if you’ll forgive\nus, and our embarrassed poverty, this time.\nSincerely,\nHarry J.
