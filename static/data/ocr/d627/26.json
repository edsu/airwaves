Harley\nDirector, Television\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nMadison, Wisconsin\nH I N C T 0 S\nDear Bill:\nLet me hasten to make an honest woman of your secretary and to confess\nray inefficiency.\nThe day after you were here last week Harold Wigren brought in the\nmaterial you had sent me in relation to the .Joint NAEB - DAVI film\nproject. I bad passed this material on to Harold when I received\nit in December 11 and asked him for his recommendations. Harold\ndid not have an opportunity to study the material and passed it\nback to me when he left last week for Houston.\nAt the first opportunity I shall study this material and probably\npass it on to our Television Committee for their consideration\nduring our convention in Cincinnati.\nVery truly yours,\nRobert C.
