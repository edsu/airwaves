We hope that initiation of this service\nwill help to relieve the frustrations and sense of powerlessness felt by\nmany of the poor and that it will demonstrate our Governmentâ€™s interest in\nimproving their lives.\"\nDr. Goff's office will respond to correspondence and also provide\npersonal interviews. Representatives of the poor will be able to obtain\nclarifying information about Office of Education programs and receive\nhelp with specific problems relating to programs for the disadvantaged.\nThe Office of Programs for the Disadvantaged is advising all relevant\norganizations of the existence of the new service.\nm"
