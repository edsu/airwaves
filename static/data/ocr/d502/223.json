It is believed that funds in the magnitude of\nnot over $12*000.00 for a fiscal year’s projects would toe adequate to begin to\naccomplish several of the most critically needed tasks in this general research\narea.\nAs mre end more of the 232 channels reserved for Educational Television\nbegin to be occupied* the occupants find themselves in need of the services of the\nNAEB* as the association of educational broadcasters.
