The\nsymphony television series is going well too: the kinescope I showed in New York\nwasnâ€™t too good from the standpoint of kinescope, and the projector used for it\nwas even worse; but on the whole that series is going well too. Incidentally,\nI showed that kine to Howard Barlow and his production staff the next evening and\nthey were very enthusiastic, it was projected immediately following a Voice of\nFirestone kine made by NBC, and the difference in quality between the NBC kine and\nthe one that you saw at the FAF headquarters was considerably less than you would\nhave expected. But we have high hope that the kinescope problem will be under\ncontrol by the time the next program goes on the air February 22 and that at least\ntwo of the first four kinescopes will be of near-air quality, if not that.\nThe Paulu family life has been a bit complicated by the fact that last week\nmy six-year old daughter fractured her right leg. This knocks the whole family\nroutine out of order for awhile, but things are now back on thetrack again at\nhome too.\nwith best personal regards,\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nManager\nBnc.-3\nBP:cjm"
