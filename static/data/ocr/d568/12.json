All of its national organiza¬\ntions appear likely to be affected, including the Nation¬\nal Association of Educational Broadcasters. With that\nin mind, the NAEB executive committee wishes to emphasize\nthe following points:\n(1) The heart of any organization is people. NAEB's\ntradition of service and achievement reflects the continu¬\ning dedication and talent of its Washington staff. The\nexecutive committee affirms its active concern and sense\nof responsibility for the professional welfare of those\nindividuals.\n(2) The mission of NAEB is professional service. What¬\never organizational changes may take place in coming\nmonths, the specific services this association has per¬\nformed must survive. The executive committee resolves to\ninsure the continuation of those services—for institu¬\ntions and individuals, and for all media—by any means\nnecessary. The committee directs the NAEB staff to ex¬\nplore and recommend alternative ways of accomplishing\nthat end.\n1346 CONNECTICUT AVENUE N.W. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20036 (202) 785-1100"
