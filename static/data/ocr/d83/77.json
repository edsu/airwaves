I hope you didn*t mind: to save\nyou trying to pay me by Canadian check (the $20.00), had check for that\namount of it made out directly to me. Hence that $20.00 has been de¬\nducted fra© your check.\nI'd given Rose same figures to add (equivalent of meals etc. so you\nweren't out for your expenses while here), let me know if you're still\nout too much. Or was part of your expense borne by Evanston group?\nAs always I was much stimulated to dig further — and keep going — by\nyour ’goading” and ’’probing” effect. Our best to Carinae and children.\nSincerely,\nEJS :mr\nHarry J. S&arnia\nPresident"
