Havanas\nLast year the College of Education recommended the establishment\nof a printing laboratory for use of its students in industrial educa¬\ntion and a request for non-recurring funds for this purpose was submit¬\nted to the non-recurring committee.\nAfter I had learned of this request, I suggested to the College\nof Education that it might provide training for its students in\nindustrial education in the School of Journalism’s typography labora¬\ntory. This proposal was investigated and it was concluded that an\nexpansion of the Journalism laboratory could fulfill the needs of\nstudents in industrial education.\nWe now have on the campus a new staff member in Journalism, Mr.\nGlenn Hanson, who is qualified in the field of typography and printing.\nIn cooperation with representatives of the College of Education, he is\npreparing a recommendation for additional printing equipment.\nUnfortunately, the present space for the Journalism typography\nlab will not accommodate all the equipment recommended, and I am,\ntherefore, exploring the possibility of additional space.\nAdequate additional space can be provided for this joint\nenterprise if the activities of the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters could be moved to some other quarters. This activity does\nnot necessarily have to be housed in Gregory Hall, but it does need\nquarters that are reasonably fireproofed. I would appreciate it very\nmuch if you could study the matter of housing the NAEB activity in\neither Altgeld Hall or some other site that might be available by\nSeptember 1955* Mr. Frank E. Schooley can give you details or the\nspace requirements for the NAEB activity.\nF. S. Siebert\nDirector\nFSSijs\nccj Mr. F. E. Schooley"
