Every single Sunday you811\nfind ten thousand people going over to the country for a breath\nof fresh air, and a sight of green fields. Same thing with the\nHarlem omnibus see; seen one of them?\nI think so,..\nI believe you haven*t; you*d remember it if you had. Double-deckers,\nlike a steamboat. Every Sunday, out they go, too, filled to over-\nflowing. And in the evening you* 11 see the folks coming back from\nthe woods and fields and Harlem, all laden down with green boughs\nand bunches of flowers. Lovely sight. You see, Sunday3s probably\nthe only day the working, man has a ohanoe to take Ms wife and\nfamily out for an airing.\nSo Americans are not as conscientious In Sunday observance as we had\nthought?\nIt8d be a great mistake to think that. Heard of what they call the\nnight blooming oereus?\nI have heard of it.\nIt5s a flower; you wait years for it to open. Nell, there *s one\nnear here. Last year it opened; but it chanced to be on a Sunday\nevening, and a lot of people wouldn*t go to see it. Conscientious\nscruples.\nThe sentiments do them credit.\nHow do you make out that? If there was anything wrong in coming\nout on a Sunday, I should have thought the flower might have known\nabout it. May I enquire what church you gentlemen belong to?\nWe are Roman Catholics.\nWell, we have plenty over here: we have plenty of everything. Any\nkind of religion you want."
