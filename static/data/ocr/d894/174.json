In sound broad¬\ncasting a microphone changes sound\nwaves into electrical impulses; then at\na distance a loudspeaker changes the\nelectrical impulses back into sound.\nIn facsimile broadcasting the scanner\ntakes the place of the microphone and\nthe recorder takes the place of the\nloudspeaker.\nWith facsimile, the copy is wrapped\naround a revolving drum in the sta¬\ntion. A scanner—an electric eye—\nchanges each grade of black into an\nelectrical impulse, which is broadcast,\nlit the home this electrical impulse is\npicked up by an ordinary radio re¬\nceiver and relayed to a facsimile re¬\ncorder.\nStatic Interferes.\nA roll of paper which has been\nchemically treated to make it sensi¬\ntive to electrical impulses feeds\nthrough the recorder. The impulses\nturn the paper black and thus repro¬\nduce the original copy. Static blurs and\nblackens the reproduction. FM (fre¬\nquency modulation) channels are freer\nfrom static than AM (amplitude mod¬\nulation) channels. For this reason\nfacsimile newspapers will be broad¬\ncast over FM stations to FM sets ex¬\nclusively.\nAccording to many persons facsim¬\nile newspapers have been “just over\nthe horizon’’ for 20 years. However,\nfor a variety of reasons they are just\nnow being developed. The rapid ex¬\npansion of * FM stations and improve¬\nments in the sensitizing of paper after\nWorld War II have given facsimile\nnewspapers a big push.\nRelationship to Newspapers.\nMost observers judge that in its\npresent stage the facsimile newspaper\nwill be an adjunct to the large daily\nnewspaper. However, others disagree.\nRobert D. LeaVitt, of the Hearst news¬\npapers, says that when facsimile “has\ndeveloped into an economically sound\nenterprise ... its competition will\nrender obsolete the newspaper as we\nknow it today’’. He says that the\n’standard newspaper has two advan¬\ntages over radio today—appeal to\nthe eye and permanence; facsimile\nhas both of these and in addition it\nwill be faster and more convenient.\n; p:H a\nAn early facsimile receiver.\nConi. p-sje."
