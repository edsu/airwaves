Sulzer, Director\nRadio & \".television Cocsaunicatione\nRadio Station WFIU-PM\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Brarao:\nBill and I started wording an the MEB committee Ust in October\n- and we're still wonting on it. However, nothing has been firm-\ned up for sure.\nIn our initial discussions we thought we would leave the Public\nRelations committee as is, except to delete Cheydleur (vho is\nout of the country), and Siegel. This would leave Sulzer, chair-\nnan. Bender, Benjamin, Bouwaan, Bsneguy, and father Williams.\nI suspect that you will be hearing from Bill very soon cm this,\nand I would suggest that you go ahead with any ideas you have an\nthe assumption that it will come out about as above.\nHope there will be some way that the Hills and Sulzerc get toÂ¬\ngether before the former take off for Washington - actually I will\ngo about the first of March and Dorothy and the kids will stay here\nuntil school is out.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Bill\nMministrative Tice President\nP* S. Your \"Met\" broadcast brochure looks good."
