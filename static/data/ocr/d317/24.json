From 191*6-1*8,\nBeversdorf, besides serving on the University of Houston faculty, played\nfirst trombone with the Houston Symphony, the Houston Summer Symphony\nand the Houston Light Opera Company. Before coming to Indiana in 1950,\nhe played with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.\nHis awards include the National Federation of Women's Club\nprize in 191*7 for ’’Reflections for Small Orchestra,” the Texas Com¬\nposers * Award for ’’Mexican Portrait” which was performed by the Houston\nSymphony in 191*8, and a Danforth Teacher Study Grant in 1956.\nHis \"Symphony for Winds and Percussions” has been acclaimed\nas one of the two most significant works for concert band written in\nthis century.\nThe Quartet No„ 1 was premiered by the Berkshire Quartet in\nBloomington in 1952, and has been played by the Fine Arts Quartets of\nthe University of Kansas and the University of California. This winter,\nit will be performed both in Copenhagen and on tour by the quartet of\nthe Danish National Orchestra.
