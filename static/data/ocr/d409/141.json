We recognize only too well the special\nproblems involved. We recognize, too, the great opportunity it presents.\nIt is our belief the subject matter for such a program need not necessarily\nbe restricted to the kinds of things which are traditionally offered on\n“children’s programs.” We feel the interests of young people are very\nbroad, and we hope to challenge as many of these interests as possible.\nPortions of the MICKEY MOUSE CLUB will touch on travel, science,\nhealth, vocational planning, sports, literature and many other things.\nWe have the greatest respect for the basic intelligence of our future adults\nand their desire to learn. We, likewise, are aware of a sometimes\nprevalent habit of “talking down” to audiences of this type. To the best\nof our ability we aim to “talk up” as much as possible as we program\nour material, remembering that we will accomplish more if we\n“entertain” as we go along.\nThe MICKEY MOUSE CLUB represents 260 hours of television. To make\nit possible requires the support of a number of sponsors. We appreciate the\nconfidence of the following companies who will be our sponsors at\nvarious times during the year: Am-Par Record Corp.; Armour & Co.;\nB & B Enterprises, Inc.; Bristol-Myers\nCo.; Campbell Soup Co.; The\nCarnation Co.; The Coca-Cola Co.;\nGeneral Mills, Inc.; S. C. Johnson\n& Son, Inc.; Lettuce, Inc.; Mars, Inc.;\nMattel, Inc.; Miles Laboratories, Inc.;\nMinnesota Mining & Manufacturing\nCo.; Morton Salt Co.; S.O.S. Co.;\nVick Chemical Co.; Welch\nGrape Juice Co."
