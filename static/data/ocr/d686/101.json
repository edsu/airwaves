Johnson, Chairman\nInterstate & Foreign Commerce Committee\nUnited States Senate\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Senator Johnson:\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters\nrespectfully solicits your attention to a major problem\nIn the future of FM and TV broadcasting in these United\nStates — the matter of Insuring that TV receiver manu¬\nfacturers take steps to include FM band tuners in their\nTV receiving sets*\nRegion III\nJAMES MILES\nWBAA, Purdue University\nLaFayette, Indiana\nOhio, Michigan, Indiana, Illi¬\nnois and Wisconsin.\nRegion IV\nIRVING R.

MORRIS\nKOAC, Oregon State College\nCorvallis, Oregon\nMontana, Washington, Califor¬\nnia, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Ari¬\nzona, Utah and Territory of\nHawaii.\nThousands of TV receiving sets are being made and\ndistributed with no provision ifoatsoever for reception\nfrom the FM spectrum* Since the FM band Is squarely in\nthe center of the TV channel allocation pattern, provision\nfor an FM tuner or “continuous tuning\" as provided In the\nDuMont receiver, can be included for a nominal cost, &\nmatter of only several dollars*\nFailure to equip TV sets for FM tuning, in our opinion,\nis not only short-sighted, but almost criminally negligent*\nWe are all familiar with the difficulties FM has\nexperienced to date and aware that most of these difficulties\nhave nothing to do with the technical and engineering aspects\nof FM* Rather they represent social and economic forces\nwhich fall Into three categories:\n1. FM had to make a \"second start\" after\nthe FCC reallocated the FM band, putting\nan undue hazard on a new medium*\nPUBLICATIONS EDITOR\nBURTON PAULU\nKUOM, University of\nMinnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W. SMYTHE\nIllinois University Communi¬\ncations Research Institute\nUrbana, Illinois\n2® TV growth promotion put FM promotion\n\"Into the shadow\". TV, If you please,\nhas \"glamour\", whereas FM Is primarily\na better way of doing the AM Job*\n3* Advertisers failed to support the new\nmedium because limited numbers of FM\nreceivers (circulation), and most FM\nlicensees were also AM licensees who\napplied for FM stations as a \"hedge\" and\nhence took a \"wait and see\" attitude\ninstead of pushing the new medium, and\nin some cases, apparently took \"antl-FM\nmeasures\".\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM, FM, and TV radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by schools, colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
