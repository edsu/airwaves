As yet, she has not confirmed\nthis, but I wi 11 call her at her home next week.. Right now\nin the tremendous heat that has settled over Japan I suspect\nshe is living at a mountain resort.\nBut I should like to turn attention to something else\nin this letter, namely some good ( albeit conservative and\ninstitutional) publicity. I wrote a friend of mine at B/T\nWilson McCarthy. He suggests ( see enclosed) that you get\nin touch with Mr. Fred Fitzgerald, the news editor.. So ^m\ngoing to ask you to devise the story and send in the glossy\nprints for B/T, and only hope the story will break in the\nfirst weeks in September.\nI would suggest that you state something of this kind.\nJohn Lerch, writer-producer, has just completed a series\nof 12 fifteen minute programs for the National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters. The taped programs emanate\nfrom Tokyo and are informative in nature, consisting of\ncurrent topics in the news, discussion with political\nand artistic leaders, interviews with key figures who\nthrough light on problems basic to Japanese life and\nNAEB plans to release the series to _ subscriber\nstations in the fall ( date). Mr. Lerch is currently\nradio production supervisor with the Voice of the United\nNations Command, operated by the Army Psychological\nWarfare Detachment in Tokyo. Prior to this assignment in\nthe Far East, he was a producer for Radio Free Europe in\nMunich, il Above photo shows him at an exhibit of miniature\nshrines; ‚Äùthis one being the Yomeimon Gate at Nikko, perhaps\nthe most famous and elaborate in Japan.
