Uti¬\nlizing these media takes courage, imagination,\nand skill, and there is no dearth of those ele¬\nments in 0E0. What is lacking is only the oppor¬\ntunity.\nWe have dealt, thus far, with divisional concerns,\nand with the technical resolution of the problem\nof transposing the classroom experience into tele¬\nvision terms. We turn now to those problems in¬\nherent in developing \"software\" materials, those\ntexts and guides which make learning by electronic\ncommunications media meaningful. There are two\nthings which command our attention. First, is the\nfact that a tremendous amount of completed ma¬\nterials already exists. The techniques for pro¬\nducing these kinds of materials has not changed\nappreciably since the first, education-oriented,\nmaterials were produced. What has changed is how\nwe think about the materials, how we see the prob¬\nlems of education, now."
