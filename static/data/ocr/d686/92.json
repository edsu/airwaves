It is going to be extremely\ndifficult for democracy to last if the majority of our people can be taken in from\none day to the next by the kind of spurious stuff, for example, that was handed out\nby Nazi propaganda .. that is cast out to the unfortunate millions behind the Iron\nCurtain. We have seen what this viciously applied propaganda can do in world history\n... we know the evils broadcasting can create and foster. Our tragedy is we have yet\nto find anything comparable on the other side of the ledger.\nNow here is the whole problem of communicating ideas through the air. We know\nthat most people don't like the process of learning. And yet, the mass education\nwhich we need has to go right on through the whole period of people's lives.\nIt has been said that it is as unnatural to end your education at l4, as it is\nto die at l4. It becomes obvious that a great deal of this education has to be done\nby people themselves. This is where the essence of the broadcasting of ideas lies.\nIt is the achieving of that delicate balance between persuading people to learn by\nsugaring the pill ... and giving them only sugar.\nYou will recall that I mentioned radio and television are merely tools. The\nquestion is ... how are they being used?"
