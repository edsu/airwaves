This, of course, does not necessarily represent the viewpoint\nof the MAEB.\nI m also concerned with the use of the Joint Committee*a\nname in connection with the 3t. Louis plan. Some of our mmaber stations\nare besoming unnecessarily concerned over what is g»lng to happen to\neducational M broadcasting when educational television comes. In\nSt. Louis, they have begun to consider the elimination of KSLH, with\nthe idea of converting the transmitter to television use. Our member\nstation out there was told that they would have to take their choice\nof FM or Television.\nThe assumption la that both MAKE and the Joint Committee\nare tied in with the so-called **St. Louis Plan**, and we are, therefore,\nplaced in a somewhat sideward position. For your own information, NAEB\nbelieves that \"radio is far from doad and that tho attempt to convert\nan Fit Transmitter to television operation la eoonomicslly wasteful\".\nI am, furthermore, somewhat concerned by the statement made\nby fid Fuller, poking at \"the commercial boys\". We have constantly\nstriven to eliminate# this so-called \"battle of education vs commerce\".\nI certainly do not recall having anything to do with authorising the\nJoint Committee to use its name la taking such a stand.\nI hope you will\nbenefit of your joint\nCC P&ulu, Aumpus, Hull\ndiscuss this with Ed and let me have the\nCordially,\nSeymour V. Siegel\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
