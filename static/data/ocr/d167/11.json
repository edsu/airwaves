Hill\nVice President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue\nWashington, D. C.\nDear Harold:\nThank you for your letter of March 31st, I think! But seriously,\nI'm sorry that we took the action we did with respect to the television\nrepresentative - if I was going to conduct the election, I should have\nread the Constitution and By-Laws first.\nIn any event, as you note, it is a matter for Messrs. Etheridge,\nJohnston, Petersen and Mrs. Newman to resolve. I'll send them copies\nof this letter as a way of saying that if I can help I'll be glad to but will\notherwise assume that they, of course, will take whatever action is\nneeded within the region.\nWith best wishes,\nSincerely,\nJ®hn Young\nJY/af\ncc: James Etheridge\nRoy Johnston\nJames Petersen\nMarjorie Newman"
