Shall do what I can here\nwith the electrical engineering division, at once.\nWells Foshay and I spent Sunday afternoon together,\nand he is so excited about the present development\n(the dynamics of media as related to the charts) that\nhe wants me at once as a visiting Professor, but failing\nthat on any basis at all to carry on this work.\nI merely mention this to cheer you up and I expect that\nit should be kept confidential.\nI am myself staggered by the implications of discover¬\ning the high definition tactual component in the television\nimage. This not only means that the T.V. image is directly\ntactual and sculptural, but that as image it tends toward\nthe auditory. Even without any sound track (cf Malraux\nand The Voices of Silence a propos of this auditory phase\nof sculpture). The relation of the sculptural to the\nauditory is one which we had brought up in Explorations\na propos of sculpture being on the frontier between sight\nand sound—a fact which appears in the amazing phenomenan\nof the sound waves on the jet wings becoming visible at the\nmoment of breaking the sound barrier. The light through\naspect of television is better stated by saying you are the\nscreen, not the camera; whereas in film you are the camera.\nShall be in Detroit Monday to work on the Video at Wayne.\n/ tsiA ' t , kj< 0^\" i—€.\nC.fT% ■"
