  "text": "GENERAL\nARCHITECTURAL\nTYPES\nWLBC, Muncie, Indiana\nCONTEMPORARY: Exterior form in this case evolves\nnaturally from efficient spatial organization of the in¬\nside. Showing expert use of modern materials and\nmethods, this building is in harmony with its site and\nis altogether distinctive in expressing its function.\nBROADCAST\nWRVA, Richmond, Va.\nTRADITIONAL: Special conditions may indicate a re¬\ncourse to tradition. However, symmetries achieved on\nthe exterior may be independent of internal needs.\nDistinctive expression of the building's purpose here\ncomes principally from the proximity of the antenna.\nTYPES\nACCORDING\nTO LOCATION\nKDYL, Salt Lake City, Utah\nRURAL: Such locations impose fewer limitations to the\ndevelopment of expressive exterior forms. Freedom,\nhowever, must not be pushed to the point of defying\nall environmental restraint, and there should be no\nattempt to dwarf the out-of-doors with monumentality.\nKJBS-FM, San Francisco, Calif.\nCITY: The chief prerequisite here is removal above sur¬\nroundings disturbing to transmission. Thus, ready-made\nlocations make interior planning largely an adjustment\nto existing spaces and exterior expression limited to\nthe antenna and perhaps some identificatory lighting.\nSIMPLE\nUTILITY\nTYPES\nWHAV, Haverhill, Mass.\nKOAD, Omaha, Nebr.\nCEMENT OR CINDER BLOCK: This example of cement\nblock coated with stucco shows strictly utilitarian use\nmade of economic building materials. In some cases,\nthe locations and surroundings do not really warrant\nan elaborate concentration on external appearances.\nWOOD FRAME: Many small new stations springing up\nmake few early gestures at special housing. Here a for¬\nmer milkhouse has been taken over and converted, with\na few swift adaptations inside to take care of equip¬\nment and provide rudimentary comforts for personnel."
