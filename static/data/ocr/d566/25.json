  "text": "It so happened that the transfer of network head¬\nquarters coincided with the undertaking of an extensive recorded\ncollection by the University .library* Tentative arrangements are\nbeing made to file NAEB programs in this library collection,\nrecorded on 16\" discs. A few of the discs have been made.\nAll material that has returned to this headquarters is being\nretained until the recordings are made. The file wall not\ninclude all of the earlier series, but will cover the vast\nmajority of programs which have been circulated.\nFiles and Statistical Data\nW'e have endeavored to continually improve and refine our\nsystem of records and files. While it is not readily apparent\nin this report, we have an eye cast toward sufficiently complete\nand accurate data that objective evaluations of the operation\ncan be made. With the impending increase in the scope of our\noperations this becomes even more important.\nThis problem is really twofold. The records in network\nheadquarters are of no more value than the accuracy of the in¬\nformation supplied by the statiohs.\nUse of the NAEB News-Letter\nRecently we have undertaken the practice of furnishing the\nmonthly News-Letter with approximately a page of copy about the\nnetworks activities. While a more detailed consideration of\npromotion and publicity appears in a later section of the report,\nit can be said here that this use of the News-Letter seems to be\na very worthwhile arrangement. We modestly hope that before\nlong we can have a small section labelled, \"Network News\", or\nsomething such, in which we can regularly keep members advised\nof our operation.\n-14-"
