New York City, with all its quarter of a\nmillion population, is very unequal in style and quality from one\ndistrict to another. The great avenue of Broadway is striking from\nits continuous and unbroken length of three miles in a straight line:\nbut its breadth, about eighty feet, is not sufficiently ample for the\ndue proportion to its length. It is, moreover, wretchedly paved, both\nin the center and on the sides. Large holes and deep pits are fra®\nquently seen$ and while before some houses the slabs of stone are large\nuniform and level, there is often an immediate transition from these\nto broken masses of loose stones, that require the greatest caution to\npass over, especially in wet or frosty weather. And as for Third Ave¬\nnue, and Eighth Avenue: these are no more than long muddy lanes, lead®\ning, respectively to the remote villages of Harlem and ManhattanviHe."
