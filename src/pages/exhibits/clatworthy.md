      In the late 1940s, Fred Friendly began his collaboration with Edward R.
      Murrow by asking him to narrate *I Can Hear It Now*, a series of record
      albums using original recordings to portray historical events. The duo
      later developed the concept into *See It Now*, a CBS News television
      program premiering in November 1951.
