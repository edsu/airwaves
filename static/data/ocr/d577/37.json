(As a result of the NAEB con¬\nsultation team visit, the University was able to present the information\nnecessary to secure the funds needed for construction of the station, a\nconstruction permit was received from the FCC October 1, 1958, a manager\nhas now been hired, a staff is being assembled, and the station is scheduled\nto commence operation in the very near future. Similar testimonials to the\ncrucial importance of this service have been received from Memphis and\nother areas.)\nThe NAEB is especially pleased that many ETV stations now on the\nair are operating more efficiently and successfully as a result of this con¬\nsultation service. And we are proud that some are now on the air, or\nunder construction, which, according to those responsible for planning\nthem, would never have reached this stage without this assistance. We\nbelieve this service, too, in its inconspicuous accomplishments, was\nwell justified, and that funds used for this sendee were well spent."
