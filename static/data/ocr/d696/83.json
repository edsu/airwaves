  "text": "PERSONALIZED PUBLIC RELATIONS PAGE TWO\nBut solid public relations embodies more than the\nplanned publicity campaign, advertising, the studied att¬\nempt to cement relations with the press, and the various\nother calculated promotion strategies employed by the\npublic relations pro. It is high-caliber public statesman¬\nship from top management on down.\nEveryone practices public relations in his assoc¬\niation with others every day. The cheerful ’’good morn¬\ning” of the boss greeting his secretary, or the pleasant¬\nries exchanged with the elevator operator, the word of\nencouragement to the janitor all add up to public relat¬\nions -- personal, human relations.\nIn the same personal way, every employee is a\npublic relations representative of his organization. The\nattitudes reflected by these ’’ambassadora” -- regardless\nof their positions in the organization -- are noted and the\norganization judged accordingly. The courteous, helpful\nswitchboard operator, the receptionist’s pleasant voice\nand manner in greeting a visitor, or the tact of a tele¬\nvision producer can make friends for the organization\nthey represent."
