That the shows produced under the project need not be wholly\ndramatic, but may be in the field of public discussion, interview\ntype, etc®\n10. That applicants should have the series of shows very well outlined\nbut not completely written or produced before the application is m\nmade under this grant0\n11. That applicants for aid under this grant will be given 60 days in\nwhich to get their applications in to NAEB headquarters.\n12. That applications will be screened at headquarters to weed out\nthose which are obviously not suitable and that members of the\ncommittee would then be asked to pass on those applications which\nthe headquarters screening has certified.\n13. That all applications will be processed within 30 days after the\ndead line for turning them in to headquarters.\nThese are some of the things which I jotted down from our conversations. There may\nbe other points which I failed to'get, however, I think each of us should do the\nsame so that Jim may formulate a method of procedure for handling the project as\nsoon as he is given the green light by Fletcher.\nI am of the opinion that while we should expedite this project with great alacrity,\nthere is grave danger that we can move too fast so that results will not be of high\ncaliber. Certainly, I don*t think if® should be as slow as the four series now being\nbroadcast by the other FAB projects.\nCarbon copies: MEB Officers and Board of Directors\nJWD/am"
