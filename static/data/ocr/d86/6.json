A year later a similar project was launched in the Central California\narea by KVIE in Sacramento. Today, by virtue of a grant from the Fund for\nAdult Education, these two stations are linked by microwave and are sharing\ninstructional telecasts with a combined classroom population of more than a\nquarter-million elementary and intermediate grade students.\nPrior to the passage of legislation permitting the use of broadcast television\nby the public schools, several notable experiments were undertaken in the\nState to determine the feasibility of television for instruction at the col¬\nlege level. During the academic years 1956-57 and 1957-58 a major research\nproject, financed by the Fund for the Advancement of Education, was undertaken\nby San Francisco State College and KQED to determine the effectiveness of tele¬\nvised instruction to college students in their own homes. The positive results\nof this experiment have led to plans for a wider use of this technique by the\nState College System. At the same time, other colleges have employed closed\ncircuit systems with considerable effect, notably San Jose State College, Comp¬\nton College, and Los Angeles City College. More recently the Anaheim School\nDistrict has employed a closed circuit system at the elementary level in a\nproject that promises to become a prototype for the State.\nThe State of California has cause to take pride in the quality of its achieve¬\nments in the field of educational television. Important as these achievements\nhave been, however, they are not commensurate either with the size and power\nof this State, the comparable growth of educational television in other states,\nor the magnitude of the problems of education in California."
