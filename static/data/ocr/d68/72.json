Each teacher's specialties comple¬\nment those of the other teacher.\nIn general, the television teacher is responsible for the common\nelementsof information and interpretation and foropening doors to further\nexploration. The classroom teacher prepares the students for the tele¬\nvision presentation and weaves it into the fabric of the total learning\nsituation. As the specialist in the needs and interests of particular\ngroups and individuals, the classroom teacher sees that learning is facil¬\nitated by other experiences, such as discussion, laboratory experiments,\nsmall group activities, practice and drill, creative expression, problem\nsolving, and individual study.\nLevel 3 Almost the entire basic body of course or lesson\ncontent is provided by the television teacher.\nIn some instances, high school and college students have met\nrequirements in some subjects by studying television courses without the\naid of any classroom teacher.\nH-4"
