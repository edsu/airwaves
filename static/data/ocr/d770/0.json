BOX 487, SYDNEY 2001\nTELEPHONE: 31-0211\nCABLES: \"ABCOM\" SYDNEY\nAUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION,\nBROADCAST HOUSE,\n145 ELIZABETH STREET,\nSYDNEY, AUSTRALIA\n1st October, I969\nDear ABU Member,\nEnclosed are further documents for use during the meetings of the\nABU Programme Committee and the ABU Engineering Committee to be held\nin Sydney on 14â€”16 October 1969.\nAs mentioned in our previous letter we are sending copies of the\nProgramme documents to ABU Liaison Officers and of the Engineering\ndocuments to ABU Technical Liaison Officers and we would be grateful\nfor their help in bringing these reports to the notice of those\ninterested in them. In cases where we already know the names of the\ndelegates to the Programme and Engineering Committees, we are also\nsending copies to them. We hope that distributing the documents at\nthis stage will give delegates adequate time to study them before\ncoming to the meetings.\nIt will not be necessary for the delegates to bring with them to\nSydney the copies of documents which are now being distributed, as\nadditional copies will be supplied to delegates when they reach\nSydney. At this stage it is unlikely that further documents will be\ndistributed. Later documents received after this date will be\ndistributed to delegates upon their arrival in Sydney.\nIf your organisation wishes to contribute documents for use during\nthe meetings of the Programme and Engineering Committees, we would be\nvery grateful if these documents could be sent to the ABU office in\nSydney as soon as possible.\nYours sincerely,\nJirrt/r\nSTUART REVILL\nHead of Information Services and\nABU Liaison Officer"
