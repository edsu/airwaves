Such a small fact as the printers not putting\nIn page numbers for the reader is indicative. Because a\nmanuscript was read very slowly, it was not used as a work\nof reference. A printed book could be read very fast.\nIt was no longer necessary, or convenient, to memorize\nwhen reading quickly. But it became necessaiy to refer to\nparticular passages in a book. Yet it was a century before\nsuch means of reference were provided by printers.\nIt took less time for creative writers, like Rabelais,\nto grasp the new art-dimensions of printing. And Aretino\nquickly discovered that the printed pamphlet could be\n”the scourge of princes”. But it is not till Montaigne\nand Cervantes that print comes into its o\\m as a new kind\nof art form. The effect of printing on industry, and\ncommerce, was speedy and extensive.\n(a) In what sense was an exactly repeatable com¬\nmodity, such as printed book, a new event in\ncommerce?\n(b) In the East to-day at a bazaar, does the\nprocedure of bargaining have anything to\ndo with the absence of exactly repeatable\ncommodities?"
