W. Argow, Editor\nOCTOBER 1, 1954\nNUMBER 6\nOne Dollar Brings You\nMembership in ACBB\nRadio and TV are the source of much of\nour information and entertainment. They\nare educators and creators of public opin¬\nion. They enter our homes and influence\nour way of life. As individual citizens we\nhave little say about what is provided by\nthese powerful media. We can only choose\nfrom what is available, or do without. As\nmembers of the American Council for Bet¬\nter Broadcasts, however, we become part\nof a national organization dedicated and\nactively working to retain the good pro¬\ngrams now on the air and through cooper¬\native efforts and Look-Listen projects, to\nsecure the best possible programs in all lines\nfor American viewers and listeners.\nOctober has been designated by ACBB\nas individual membership month and we\nhope that new members and local groups\nalong with renewals and state and national\norganizations will swell membership and\nincrease the effectiveness of the Look-Listen\nproject and the numerous other activities of\nACBB.\nA one-dollar membership in ACBB\nmakes you a part of the national organi¬\nzation, brings you five issues of the ACBB\nNewsletter, gives you the privilege of par¬\nticipating in the 1954-55 Look-Listen pro¬\nject. gives your group the compiled results\nof that project and provides you with the\nopportunity of making your voice heard in\nthe use and development of radio and TV.\nWhen a local group joins ($1.00-$3.00, de¬\npending on number of members) and ten\nof its individual members, ACBB offers to\nprovide the cards free as well as the other\nmaterial for the Look-Listen project. Thirty\npersons monitoring and evaluating radio and\ntelevision, discussing their findings and\ncomparing them with those of others across\nthe nation, can be real forces for better\nradio-TV and for understanding and respect\nbetween broadcaster, radio-TV stations and\nthe public.\nThere is no time like the present to send\na dollar for membership in the American\nCouncil for Better Broadcasts, 423 N. Pinck¬\nney St., Madison, Wisconsin, and to encour¬\nage your neighbors and organizations to\njoin. Also, what could be a better gift to\nfriends and relatives than a membership\nin ACBB?

Yet the station has per¬\nsisted in juggling (it) so as to make it lose\nthe identity that it established a couple of\nyears back when the all-classical music\nformat had the whole industry talking . . .\nLatest innovation is use of pop music in\nthe first hour (12-1 a.m.) with classical\nmusic the rest of the way.’’\nTwo instances are cited of other stations\nmoving in with classical music where NBC\nhad substituted popular fare; the question\nis then asked: “Then why the pops, just at\nthe hour when classical music would be\nmost effective?”\nClassics Preferred\nCBS has found that classical music is\npreferred on its “Music ’Til Dawn” all-\nnight show. Listeners were polled by a\n“Request Week” in Boston, Washington,\nNew York, Chicago, Detroit, and San\nFrancisco. Out of 4000 replies, 2700 re¬\nquested classical selections: 1,070, semi-\nclassical; and 600, popular. Men sent in\nmore than half of the requests.\nmeet the challenge and have a voice in this\ngreat force in American life.\nMrs. Randall C.
