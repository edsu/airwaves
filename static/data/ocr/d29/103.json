Here is a\nclear-cut instance of the failure to understand that commun¬\nication can be non-verbal whether it is a building, or a\npainting, or a musical composition. But I probed a little\nmore with our lamp man and he cited the switch to three\ndimensional lighting as the main change in recent years, and\nI pointed out to him that this was the basic change that\nhad occurred in many other fields, namely: the shift from\nlight on to light through. In the same connection, I have\nrecently stumbled on a good many relevant insights into the\nsignificance of the small car, and the reasons for the decline\nof popularity of the older models. In a word, the small car\nIs not primarily a visual thing in its appeal, but appeals\nto all of the senses at once, providing satisfactions for\ntactual;kinesthetic^and auditory all-at-onceness, as opposed\nto the pictorial package job with its primary eye-appeal\nand with its promise of enclosure In an attractive package\nfor the occupant. In other words, the small car is an ex¬\ntension of oneself, aind the big car tends to be the container\nof the occupant. This, of course, is the same trend that\nIs the basis of our own media study project in which we turn\naway from primary concern with the so-called content of media.\nI shall drop separate notes to Sam Becker and Irving\nMerrill and shall move ahead, as fast as possible, with the\nsyllabus.\nMost cordially,\nhmm/rn M. Mj'iiunam\nP.S. Hope the letterhead comes through very soon. Art\nKnowles of the Ottawa Film Board appears to be our\nResearch Assistant and I hope that when the contract\nis renegotiated that we can find a little more money\nfor him."
