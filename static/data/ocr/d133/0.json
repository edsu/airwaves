Y* Elliott, of Harvard, to undertake a\nsurvey of educational problems and opportunities in\nVirginia, with particular attention to the present situa¬\ntion in educational radio and television.\nIn talking yesterday with Mr. Robert Mullen,\nDirector of the National Citizens Committee for Educa¬\ntional Television, it became apparent that information\nrelative to the scope of your Association’s work would\nbe most helpful to us.\nWhile we would appreciate general information in\nregard to your use of tape recordings for educational\nbroadcasts, one specific question which comes to mind\nat this early stage of Dr. Elliott's study is whether\nor not the Association permits the use of its tapes on\ncommercial stations. If so, must it be sustaining rather\nthan commercial time?\nI am sure that we will want to bother you with\nquestions from time to time in the future, but whatever\nyou can send us here at the outset would, I am sure, be\nof help as we try to get our bearings.\nAssistant to the President"
