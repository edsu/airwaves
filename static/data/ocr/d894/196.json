  "text": "WHGU is an integral part of Cornell University 0 It is one of\nthe natural media through which the University makes available not only\nto its students but to the area which it serves, its talents and resources,.\nThe station differs from most University-owned stations in that the revenue\nrequired for its operation is derived not by University or legislative\nappropriations but by the sale of time* Our income stays in a separate\nradio account. These funds are not comingled with the University9 s other\nfunds. The profits of the station are used exclusively for current\noperating costs and technical improvement at the station,, In addition,\nthese furds are used for activities which, although not directly connected\nwith radio broadcasting, advance the general welfare and education of the\ncommunity*\nThe University assumed control of the responsibility for the\noperation of the station in June, 1940* Since that time, the station has\nbeen nationally recognized for its operation in the public interest. During\nthe past seven years, Cornell has made repeated efforts to increase its\nhours of operation which are now limited to sunrise and sunset in New Orleans*\nQualified radio consulting engineers have made a number of searches of the\nradio spectrum for us in order to find some frequency which would serve our\nneeds and permit us to operate with unlimited time. The only possibilities\ndiscovered were two or three frequencies which would rive us a highly\nrestricted and limited nighttime coverage which would not serve more than\nthe City of Ithaca, and this, only after meeting the requirements of a\nvery complicated protective pattern, which would involve prohibitive costs\nto the University*"
