Y.\n10 F ebruary 1953\nMr. Sfraydon Ausmus\nStation WUOA\nUniversity of Alabama\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Graydon:\nI have before me Earl Wynn’s letter of February 7 relative to\nholding a Region II Seminar-Workshop at the University of North\nCarolina on March 13 and lij. I also have Frank Schooley’s undated\nmemorandum entitled ”Re: 1953 Regional Conference (or Conferences)\".\nFrank brings up the point that if we are going to have any regional\nmeetings this year, we'd better determine them rather quickly. He\nalso lists some of the suggestions which have reached him.\nOne of them was an idea from John Dunn relative to another\nmeeting in Norman. You will recall that this was brought up by\nJohn at one of our Board of Directors' meetings last November in\nMinneapolis and did not meet with too much enthusiasm. I am inclined\nto question the value of another meeting in Norman. John did a first-\nclass job of his session there last year, but I feel that -these\nmeetings should be distributed around somewhat. Norman benefited\nfrom the regional meeting last year and will have the convention\nnext year. I think this is much as we should give to any one section\nof the country. I would certainly oppose a special NAEB meeting in\nMinneapolis in view of the \"shot in the arm\" given educational broad¬\ncasting there by the general convention held at the University of\nMinnesota in November. So I feel the same way about serving Minne¬\napolis as I do about serving Norman.\nI shall not attempt to evaluate Waldo's wish relative to the\nregional meeting since I an unaware of his having any current plans\nfor such a session. Waldo benefited of course from an NAEB convention\nthere several years ago. Allen Miller's absence from Washington would\napparently cancel out that possibility, all of which brings us to\n^arl Wynn's proposal.\nMarl's letter seems to indicate a pretty good start in convention\nplanning. That section of the country would be a good place to have\nsuch a meeting since NAEB activities have tended to be centered either\naround New York or in the Middlewest. Earl is making progress in the\nmatter of television planning which is another reason for giving him\nlocal support. He has also shown real initiative and ability in\ndeveloping those trial kinescopes which indicates that he is really\ndoing something on his own and isn't expecting us to do it all.\nTherefore, I would recommend very strongly a meeting at Chapel Hill,\nI am not going into the matter of finances since I am not closely\nenough acquainted with our budget situation to do that. Frank however\ncould tell us if we have the money* If we do have the money and unless\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
