Eisenhower, followed by a\nconsideration of television's meaning for education by Arthur S. Adams, President\nof the Council. Dr. Allen B. DuMont, president of the Allen B.

On the\nformal level, discussion was fostered by dividing the participants into four\nseparate groups, each with own leaders and consultants but each discussing the\nsame agenda. After two or more hours of discussion in the smaller groups, the\nentire group would come together and the agenda would be reviewed once again,\nwith the separate group leaders and consultants constituting a panel. Within\nthis format, there were three principal areas of discussion. The first of these,\n\"The Significance of Television for the Educator\", included such topics as\nwhether television is an educational luxury or an educational essential, quali¬\nties of TV as an educational device and the like. \"Basic Planning for Education¬\nal Television\" was the second main topic, with attention given to such matters\nas FCC rules, the problem of local organization for meeting the legal require¬\nments of a station license, size of staff needed, capital and equipment costs,"
