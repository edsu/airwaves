XIX.\nDear Bob,\nIt seems to WBVB and to me, that the cable\ntransmissions of European Review have been succesful.\nMoreover WBVR is willing to supply your office with a\ncopy (or the mastertapej of the program.\nIt looks to me that this is the appropriate\nprocedure to guarantee NAEB stations a European Review\nwithout interferences and to gain time in distributing\nthe program, with the result that the station will\nreceive European Review when it still is fresh*\nWith regard to your remarks that it will be\ndifficult to ,#sell\" a program twice a week under the\nsame title and with identical characteristics, I like\nto make these suggestions as I did to Jack Summerfield.\n1. The Tuesday program remains unchanged\nin title and characteristics.\n2* The Friday European Review will be\nreplaced by \"Life in the Old WorldH*\nThis will be a 14 minutes program dealing\nwith 3 items.\nThe basic set-up is\na. A profile of an European politician,\nstatesman or economist, who is \"in the\nEuropean news\". If possible illustrated\nwith his voice.\nb. Consequences of a political development\nin Europe for a specific group of\ncitizens in a particular country.\nc. Miscellaneous."
