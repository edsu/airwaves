Smith is the guy who\nwrote you a couple of times regarding his\nmanuscript on Frieda Hennock.\nWalter and Dick Hull and several others read\nit and Walter wrote him to the effect that\nhe thought his article presented her too much\nas the great shining light for ETV reservations\nand that perhaps he should do some more reÂ¬\nsearch and then write it again. This is Smith's\nanswer.\nTo Frank Schoolev\n\\vv\nRegards,\n."
