It\nwill serve as the basis for documenting educational\nradio*s case before Congress* Hearing dates have been\nset for April 11#\nIn short, I need help—I need your help—and 2 need\nit as soon as possible* In a ©ament of weakness, you\noffered to help me in this crucial undertaking in any\nappropriate way* Since I believe you implicitly, I\nrespectfully request the pleasure of your coc^pany at\nthe MA£B headquarters in Washington for as many hours\nand days you can find (hopefully in the next week or\ntwo) to aid in the analysis of material as it relates\nparticularly to the midwestern states.\nI share with you the concern that our research efforts\nbe as fair and complete as possible* As you are well\naware, it is only because staff and financial limitations\nare so tight on the radio side of our organisation\nthat I make this unusual plea at this time*"
