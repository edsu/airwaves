Seminar\non children's television programmes and found it most\ninteresting reading. It must have been a most\nstimulating occasion and I wish very much I had been\nthere to take part, especially as there was a special\nreference to our infra-red work.\nIi m p ^\n?l?l?lW,1|l,2|l|2|3|4|S|?\nI think you may be interested to know that I am,\nat the present moment, planning to use the same\ntechnique for television and will probably be carrying\nthrough the experiments early next year. You might\nlike to keep in touch with me and my colleagues, as\nour work will be very definitely experimental to see\nwhether infra-red photography can be of use in assessing\nthe attraction of television programmes for children.\nYours sincerely,\nA.B.G. TELEVISION LTD.,\nMARY FIELD"
