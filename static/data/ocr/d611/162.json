In our opinion, this goal\nwas achieved . . .\nThe Milwaukee Star, May 8\n\"Statements made by inner core residents and\nstudents sometimes were outrageous, possibly\nlibelous, and nitpicking, but often were elo-'\nquent expressions in everyday folk language, of\nhow real people feel in real situations«\"\nThe Milwaukee Sentinel, May 4\nThe reviews go on and on. It is difficult to find anything but\nadmiration and support for what the Wisconsin State Journal called\n\"o00a great service to the state by giving a first hand impression of\nthe black view of the racial turmoil.\"\nAnd let’s not forget the listeners, the people who caught The\nInner Core on radio only.\n\"Radio at its best! ...thanks to the combined ef¬\nforts of many in your organization we have had the\nopportunity to ’walk for a week in the shoes of\nour black neighbors’0\"\n\"-“After the first hour I felt ashamed of myself\nfor getting angry about missing an hour of music\nwhen these people were missing out on life.\"\n\"You have done us, Milwaukee, the state, a great\nservice.\"\n\"It is so easy to listen to the things we like to\nhear/ but we need to also hear some things we don’t\nlike, and hopefully take some constructive action.\""
