The understanding needed is suggested in an article by Dr*\nMarshall McLuhan, of the University of Toronto, in the December issue of the\nNAEB Journal, attached herewith» A clear understanding of the basic nature of the\nelectronic media, so different in their total and side effects and potentials from\nthe printed media or even the film, is a foundation which must precede “tech¬\nniques\" instruction, if these courses are not to become merely orientation in\nthe use of gadgets. It is precisely this understanding which is lacking in most\npresent uses and teacher-training programs.\nTo presume to describe the peculiarities of the electronic media in depth\nin this document would be impractical. It is hoped that the approach outlined\nin the article of Dr. McLuhan, who would serve as one of several consultants in\nthis project, may suggest the directions in which we feel any courses in the uses\nof the electronic media must be guided if maximum value from their use is to be\nrealized. And, we might add, if many easy dangers in the patterns of their use\nare to be avoided, lest they become permanent and limiting for the future.\nProposed Project and Budget\nA. The Coordinator and his functions:\nThe proposed project would be coordinated by a Coordinator of Professional\nAdvancement, whose functions are outlined below. This procedure has proved\n, practical in the past for the NAEB in the development of special projects in\nsuch other areas as Research and Engineering."
