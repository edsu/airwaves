  "text": "WHAT YOU CAN DO\nBridges of understanding cannot be\nbuilt by governments alone. They re¬\nquire the imaginations and energies of\nprivate individuals and groups. Work¬\ning together in a spirit of equality, the\nfree and responsible citizens of Asian\ncountries and the United States can\nfurther the attainment of their common\naspirations. Each one of us bears a meas¬\nure of responsibility in this coopera¬\ntive effort.\nYou, as an American, can promote\nunderstanding by learning more about\nthe peoples of Asia, their histories, cul¬\ntures and values. You can advocate and\nsupport programs on Asian affairs by\norganizations in which you are a mem¬\nber. You can urge your organizations\nto cooperate with their Asian counter¬\nparts. You can also make contributions\nto assist this Foundation’s activities. As\na non-profit organization, we depend\non contributions and grants from in¬\ndividuals, civic organizations, founda¬\ntions, trusts, and corporations to carry\non our activities. Contributions are tax\ndeductible.\nChairman\nBoard of Trustees\nAdditional copies of this\nbrochure and further information may be\nobtained upon request from\nTHE ASIA FOUNDATION\n105 Market Street, San Francisco 5, Calif.\nNOV. 1954"
