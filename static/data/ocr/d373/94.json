  "text": "INTRODUCTION\nIn a very real sense this study represents the\ndeeply felt hope of a wide, cross-section of\npeople working within the 0E0, and in those\ncommunities where the problems of confronting\npoverty, face-to-face, keeps occurring every\nhour of each day.\nThis paper is a reflection of what many people\nhave said about the idea of using mass communi¬\ncations in our efforts to overcome poverty. It\nis partially, also, a reflection of what the\nrecipient population feel about this agency.\nThe question that most often arises is: Do the\npeople living in poverty really know about the\nagency, about the programs, about the people\nworking among them?\nSuch questions are often disconcerting, because\nthey have detracted from our ability to focus\non the central problem, the problem which re¬\npresents the major thrust of this document:\nHow can we use the mass communications media as\n\"close support\", working tools, at the community\nlevel?"
