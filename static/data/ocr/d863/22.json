  "text": "\"The Living Declaration\" program of March 1st. scorned\nwell planned, well cast and carried through. I found\nit very interesting. If the following programs are\nas well done, the series should give all who hear it\na real evaluation of our great heritage. I think\nteachers, college .and High School punils should be\nurged to listen. li.C.W.\"\nThe radio program was listened to intently at our\nhouse. It is rightfully called \"The Living Declar¬\nation \"bo cause it so vitally applies to our time and\nlife today. It is a program well worth anyones\ntime, l/e will look forward to listening to the\nrest of the series. Mr. and Mrs. R.L.\n\"The Living Heritage\" was a thrilling and informative\nstatement of freedom, he, did, however find that\nthe slightly disjointed series of episodes required\nconcentrated attention. Mrs. V.A.L.\nI missed part of the program, but enjoyed what\nI hoard very much. However, with spring coming\non, the time is bad in our family. Sunday even¬\ning is best. Could these be used in a discuss¬\nion group? C.J,\nRains one of the best to handle this role, and he did\nit in an excellent manner. The ballad singing, or\nchanting seemed odd at first, but may work in well as\nwe ^ got accustomed to the series. In general Ford Found¬\nation is to be highly commended. Am looking forward\nto this time on HdCJ. F.L.\nInformative and pleasantly educational - the\ntype of program that is needed to givo our\nchildren as well as adults a bettor understand¬\ning of our historj7\".. The musical background\nmado it hard to he ar at times. Mrs. J.p .H.\nI loved the Jeffersonian Horitc-ge program Sunday\nafternoon. It was beautifully done . L.M.S.\nInteresting, inspiring, instructive. Lot's have\nmore like i t, Mrs . A. C . I,"
