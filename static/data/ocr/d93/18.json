  "text": "April 2?, 1951\nMr. A. Frank Reel\nAmerican Federation of Radio Artists\n15 West 44th Street\nNew York IS, New York\nDear Mr. Reel:\nFirst of all may I extend our sincerest thanks to\nyou for AFRA*s permission to use the WLS series,\"The New\nWorld of Atomic Energy‚Äù. I hagge delayed writing you because\nI knew there was another problem to present to you before\nwe could begin distribution of the series.\nThere is no problem with our regular broadcast stations.\nThey will broadcast the programs one-time and send the tapes\non immediately, since we operate on a rather tight schedule.\nThe problem arises with the stations which do in-school\nbroadcasting. All of our programs are sent out on magnetic\ntape. It is our practice to have the school stations dub their\nown copies of programs. This enables them to fit the programs\ninto their complicated schedules, which are made up as much as\na semester in advance. It is my proposal that all stations\nusing the series in this way fill in the enclosed form which\nwe will retain on file here at our network headquarters. The\nquestion is, of course, is this method satisfactory to AFRA?\nNo tapes of this series have been sent out as yet, nor\nwill they be until we hear from you.\nOne additional question, does AFRA desire clee3rance\ncredit on transcriptions used in this manner? We would be\nhappy to do so if that is your wish.\nAs you indicate, we will omit station VNYC from our\nschedule.\nWe undoubtedly will have occasion to trouble you with\nour problems again in the future. I am very appreciative of\nAFRA*s goals. I was a member of the New York Local for a short\nperiod before the last war. I can assure you that the NAEB\nis most anxious to cooperate in every possible way.\nAgain our thanks for your splendid cooperation.\nCordially,\nRLR:bgm\nRichard L. Rider\nManager\nNAEB Tape Network"
