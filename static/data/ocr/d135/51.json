Houk, Jr.\n143A Orleans Circle\nNorfolk, Virginia\nDear Mrs. Houk:\nIn reply to your letter of July 1 regarding our Fact Sheet Service, I am en¬\nclosing an index for your information.\nThe Fact Sheets are an effort to digest and centralize available research,\nprincipally on the effectiveness of radio and television as instructional\ntools. The Fact Sheets also include research into techniques of presenta¬\ntion, production principles, and content and audience research. Because\nthe Fact Sheets are issued as a continuing series at irregular intervals, it\nis impossible for me to know just which copy or copies you desire. If you\nwill however, select the issue(s) from the index and let me know, I will be\nhappy to send you the Fact Sheet(s) you wish.\nFear your information the Fact Sheets are now being printed in the NAEB\nJournal and a subscription is available at $4.00 per year.\nSincerely,\nEnc.\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gans\nSecretary"
