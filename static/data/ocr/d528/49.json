He is interested in a\ndevelopment grant fojf public radio in the southeast. Could we\ndiscuss this sometime when we are meeting?\nNew item: Met with Fellows and Norwood on Friday (5th) to\ndiscuss Satellite Task Force Radio Project* Some new ideas were\ndeveloped as a result of your comments. We should have a draft\nby the time I see you on the 15th, and I'll bring along a cojjy.\nThe NERN Open House was a modest success. It is always hard to\nmeasure the benefit Grora this type affair. One which accrued was\nthat the place was cleaned up and looked quite respectable. Secondly,\nit was great for NERN, NER and NAEB staff morale. I'd estimate fcbaut\n100 people attended (200 invited) and NERN and its purpose as well as\nCPB and its role have been explained to a few more people!\nThe August 26 Memo to Managers reminded all station managers to\nreturn your questionnaire pronto. Mope that the reminder helped.\nIs there anything more you want to tell me about the briefing?\nI'd appreciate any additional information you have on that event.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:kh"
