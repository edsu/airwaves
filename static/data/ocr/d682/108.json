It provides for the mutual exchange of\nthe best programs of its member stations, and procures and\ndistributes programs from other agencies engaged s in the\nproduction of radio programs of serious purpose and stressing\nmature content.\nAn exchange network service has long been considered and\ndiscussed by educational broadcasters. The„#etwork began in <\nJanuary of 1950 when the President of NAEB/Mr. Seymour N. A\nSiegel, offered to a limited group of stations a^program series\ntitled, WE HUMAN BEINGS. The growth of & idea was phenomenal\nIt soon became apparent that the personnel of station WNYC\ncould not operate both a station and a network. An offer to\nassume custodianship of the network arnmsme was made by\nthe Division of Communications of the University of Illinois.\nIn January,1951* the operation was moved to the Illinois\ncampus. In the months that followed the network grew to\n§yenty-four participating stations. The schedule expanded to\nseven program hours per week.\n-1-\nly ^ s J"
