X, England\nACT: Permissions Department\nDear Sir:\nWe are requesting authorisation from Faber and Faber Publishing House to\nuse a poem by Marianne Moore, \"Silence”, for which we understand you hold\nthe copyright. We have relived a note from Miss Moore giving us permission\nto use her poem, but we also wanted to clear this permission with you\nas the use of this poem will be for overseas use rather than use in the\nUnited States.\nPermission to use this poem is being sought by the N.A.E.B. in connection\nwith an arrangement we have with the Voice of America to develop an\nEnglish through Poetry series. The 13 commentaries for those programs\nare being written by Professor M. L. Rosenthal of New York University.\nIfae Voice of America, in turn, working closely with Professor Rosenthal,\nwill produce 13 quarter-hour radio scripts on the basis of these\ncommentaries. 2he radio programs themselves are intended for broadcast\nto listeners overseas, and are being designed to appeal to the listeners\ninterest in poetry in the English language.\nIn each script the poem will be read in its entirety, and the listeners\nwill also be invited to read the lines aloud in appropriate units after\nthe radio speaker.\nPermission is sought both for the broadcast by the Voice of America to\noverseas countries and for broadcast in countries where local radio\nstations may receive the taped programs through the United States Infor¬\nmation Agency. Permission is also sought for publication of the poems\nthat might be published in any given country (with the aid or supervision\nof U.S.I.A.), and distributed free or at cost to radio listeners.\nPermission is also sought for eventual publication of the materials in a\nsimilar study booklet to be produced by U.S.I.A. for gratis distribution\nto overseas listeners who request such booklets.\nWe hope we will hear from you shortly and that authorization to use\nthe material in the manner which we have outlined will be forthcoming."
