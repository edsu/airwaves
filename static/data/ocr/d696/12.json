Sulzer\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nBear Elmer;\nThank you very much for your report of the Public\nRelations Committee meeting held recently in Columbus.\nI am very sorry I wasn’t able to attend for a number of\nreasons. One is that I don’t agree with the committee’s\nrecommendation that a full-time Public Relations Director\nis essential for the HAEB. 1 am convinced that an organi¬\nsation as large as the BABB should have some members who\nare capable enough to create a public relations program\nin which all of the membership could participate.\n1 have some specific suggestions which I will list\nand send you just as soon as I can get organised. I have\nbeen out-of-town and away from my desk for the last three\nweeks and you can imagine what a mountain of material has\naccumulated on my desk.\nI have been thinking about you, though and will g et\nanother note off to you in the very near future.\nWith every good wish.••\nCordially,\nMCsj\nMarion Corwell"
