The pro¬\ngram is devoted chiefly to a consideration of the techniques of\neducation by radio. The Institute passes no resolutions and\nits officers are limited to a director, W. W. Charters, and a\nsecretary, I. Keith Tyler, both of the Bureau of Educational\nResearch. The committee on the annual program for 1938\nconsists of the two officers with the addition of R. C. Higgy,\nDirector, and Byron B. Williams, Program Supervisor, of\nStation WOSU, and Edgar Dale of the Bureau of Educa¬\ntional Research."
