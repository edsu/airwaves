Doan, writing in TV Guide:\nTTIf Americans by the millions wind up this summer feeling that,\nnext to politics, the topic theyTve been deluged with on tele¬\nvision is black vs. white attitudes, that will be just fine\nwith a lot of TV people - black and white.\nItTs exactly what they’ve hoped for: to make as many people\nas possible painfully aware of deep-seated racial biases —\nand maybe grimly determine to outgrow them.\n... it is too early to know how much and how well these TV\nprograms got through to the people they needed to reach.\nThe unpredictability of events in these days of joltingly\nunexpected developments rules out comfortable expectancies.\"\nAnd from Bill Greaves of BLACK JOURNAL:\n\"... The black man has been kept out of the mainstream of\nAmerican life, and the white community has got to get on\nits bicycle and try to reverse this. One thing these\nprograms may do is generate enough interest by the white\ncommunity in the black man’s concerns to help restrain\nthose white morons who are throwing fuel on the black\ncommunity.\"\nAnd Finally, Perry Wolff of CBS:\n\"We’ve got to change some attitudes. We’ve shown too much\nof the Saturday night Negro; we’ve got to show the Monday\nmorning Negro, the Tuesday Negro. I just don’t want to\nbe fiddling when Chicago burns.\"\nWere you fiddling when Chicago \"burned\" this week? Some stations\nweren’t. Let’s talk about them.\n* * * * *"
