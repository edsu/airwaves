I have heard\nrumors on numerous occasions of motivational research being done at\nthe behest of advertising agencies and sponsors. Perhaps the pro¬\njects don°t justify the designation of motivational research in depth.\nPerhaps the information cannot be obtained in any event. Collation\nof material, however, would be hi^ily valuable if it is extant and\nobtainable. Otherwise, is it possible for NAEB to get involved in\nresearch that can help us to find out how to capture and attract the\nattention of the listening public with materials designed for serious\npurpose? Obviously, there are many varieties of such materials. A\nstart with any of them would be valuable. I think the nose-counting\nsurveys could be left to the individual stations. But that which\npenetrates more deeply into the way in which people react or can\nbe persuaded to react probably is too costly to be conducted by any\none institution. In any event, I believe that facts of this kind\nwhich are obtained should be available to all institutions.11\nBernarr Cooper. Director, Radio-TV, University of New Mexico\n\"One immediate problem on which several of us would be interested\nto have more data would be the motivational factors involved in\nlearning by television. Not enough is known about the individuals\nwho take telecourses or their reasons for taking these. Research\n^7 Indicates unusually fine results are obtained by telecourse\n/ enrollees when they are subjected to the type of examination in\n, a subject area as that administered in a controlled situation.\""
