If you are not able to listen\nto these programs through your own facilities, I would be happy to\nsend you copies as examples* Also, we will certainly forward excerpt®\nfrom our taping of European Review for the study of your own personnel*\nI am still hoping that I can find an \"angel* one of these day® who\ncan support me and my family for a summer or a year in Europe* If\nthis ever happens, you can be sure I will find my way to Hilversum\nfor that long-delayed visit.\nCordially,\nE*G* Burrows\nManager, WUOM\nCCI R.E* Underwood, Urb&na\nWm* Harley, Washington"
