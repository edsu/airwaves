As you can\nsee, this is a project designed to prepare and distribute information\nkits to help local groups develop utilization of educational broad¬\ncasts.\nWe are trying to locate people who will work with us in developing some\nof these kits. I’m sure you will agree with us that there is a lot\nstill to be done in the utilization field, Perhaps the best way to get\nat this request is to list some specific questions for your consideration.\n1. Do you have any material now available that would fit into this\ntype of kit distribution? If so, could you give me a brief\ndescription of it and indicate how it might be made available to\nthe NAEB?\n2. Will you be able to undertake the production of a utilization\nkit if the cost could be underwritten? If so, would you outline\nyour ideas?\n3. If you do not have any material or are not in a position to pro¬\nduce material, can you give me the names of people who might be\nable to help? Should I contact them or will you?\nU. Whether or not you can participate, would you please give me\nyour reaction and comments about the project?\nI know this is asking for a lot of your time, but the results will more\nthan justify our presumptiousness. If you need more information about\nthe proposed kits drop me a line and I will try to secure the answers.\nSincerely,\nClair R. Tettemer\nChairman\nTelevision Sub-committee\nNAEB Utilization Committee\nCRT/gvc\nEnel."
