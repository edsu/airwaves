Higgy, Director\nMr* John Holt\nNAEB Tsp e Network\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear John:\nEnjoyed seeing you and being with you during your visit\nin Columbus, and hope that we*ll see something of you again soon*\nThese must be busy days preparing for the important event in May*\nIncidentally, I*m starting M Journeys Behind the News” which I think\nyou put out over NAEB— from Russ Porter in Denver... well, I*m re¬\nadapting the scripts plus new information and doing it over WOSTJ now.\nWould appreciate it if you could place a discreet inquiry\nwith vour NAEB placement service man: I*ve forgotten his name, but was\nsent 600 forms last summer and thought there must be a way of circum¬\nventing this excess red tape. To continue: if you could pl*,ce an\ninquiry before I send in the material to find out what the market\nis ( possibly a place and salary estimate) of news director for\nTV, this I *d appreciate. Not sure that I »m staying and not sure that\nI*m leaving, but there may be more challenging and immediate assignments\nin educational TV popping up where they really do things, you know..\nIn other words, I*m not sure that I can afTord the luxury of WOSU\nmuch longer, andits medieval pay scale. If we could all sit with hands\nfolded until the new President arrives and presume hefs sold on TV- and\nhas a realistic concept of salaries, programs and people, then that would\nbe worth waiting for. As it is... qui sait?\nI'et he iaear from you in a spare moment, and\nwill appreciate your sounding ou^vsomething\nif you can. Cordially, Joht S\nHoward L.
