I would also like to have a rough\nbudget estimate from you as to how this $1,000 might be expended if\nyou are willing to undertake the initial part of the Job. (You can\nrefer to ray letter of December 16 for more detail about what I need\nto know before we can push the \"Go” button.)\nIf you’ll shoOt me the answers to these questions and those raised\nby Harry in his letter of yesterday, perhaps we can get this thing\nstarted without much delay. Incidentally, I would guess that you\nmight want to make your first step a visit down here so that you,\nHarry and I might firm up later actions.\nCordially,\nHBHsjp\nHarold E. .Hill\nAdministrative Vice President"
