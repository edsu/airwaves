This is an important responsibility\nand one that I hope that you can accept.\nAttached is a list of suggested names of other\nmembers of the committee. I should like to begin\nthis year a plan to help insure fuller participation\nby the membership in committee activities by in¬\nvolving ’’new blood’’, while yet preserving continuity;\nnamely, an arrangement whereby members would be\nappointed for stipulated terms of three, two or one\nyear. After the first year, three members would\ngo off and three new members come on annually.\nChairman would have one year appointments but be\neligible for reappointment.\nMay I have your reactions and suggestions as\nsoon as possible so that I can complete the\ncommittee roster for announcement in the next\nNewsletter.\nWGH:mem\ny yours,\nHarley\nEnclosure"
