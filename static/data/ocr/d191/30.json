The Network Assessment Fee for the fiscal year 1953-54 (July 1\nto June 30) is as follows:\nClass A (5 kv or more) $4C0\nClass B (l kw - 4.° kw) 250\nClass G (less than 1 kw) 150\nAt the current rate, a Glass A station (usually belonging to a large university,\ncollege, or school system) pays only $1*10 per hour of programming., This figure is\nmuch lover for smaller stations * of course. Either figure is considerably lower\nthan If the station attempted to do comparable programming with its own resources,\nFea3 proposed for the next three years appear in the table below.
