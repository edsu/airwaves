  "text": "how I*m trying to guide the thing, and any suggestions you might have are more than\nwelcoi®. Up until the Iterch-April issue, lack of tin© has determined my choices and\nplanning* With that issue, for the first time, X feel a possibility of achieving\nsome editorial balance.\nOne idea I have which I need help on is to have a series of very short statements\nby teachers. It seems to ire everything is always written from the producer*3\nstandpoint, mat about s one thing from the viewpoint of the poor teacher who has\nbeen transferred from the classroom to the studio?\nAnyway, I have two short articles by teachers who think TF teaching is the greatest*\nI*m trying to get two other kinds: one teacher who had problems with the director,\nand then, after an ironing out process they became a good working team. (I know\nsuch a case and am trying to get the article.) Also a teacher who does not like\nteaching via TV. (I also know one of these, but he won*t do the article;! don*t\nbelieve*) Do any of you knew of sources for either of these?\nSkoroia (Frol®, Edgar Dale, Castell) and Hill (Magnuson va. Orsn Harris, Lundin,\nStone and Title VII) have been good sources of leads, and Gertrude Broderick has\nsent several suggestions, as well as actual articles — the one by Carl liable on\nnew techniques for etv, and Dr. Ieszi*s article on Italian ctv. for example.\nIfy thanks to all for your help."
