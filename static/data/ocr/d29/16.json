Skornia,\nNAEB,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Ill.,\nU.S.A.\nDear Harry:\nDecember 1st, 1959\nP\nNKE3\nDEG\n1 1959\nfife\nFirst, Philip Deane*s address, 3145 P Street N.W.,\nWashington, D.C.\nThe November 25th letter to Walter Stone is a very\ncondensed capsule indeed. Apropos of page 2, item 5,\nI agree that this is a top priority matter.\nSince Laurence Burns (RCA) likes to talk publicly\nabout the huge royalties which will accrue to teachers\nfrom the publication of their efforts on tapes, why\nnot contact him directly for counsel and legal aid in\nthis matter.\nI hope there is something in Media Log which you may\nconsider worthy of Walter Stonefs attention. I shall get\nout a series of these sheets right away allowing time for\nfeed-back comment before issuing another. I shall in¬\ncorporate in tentative form all the Syllabus material on\nall media, in order to attract as wide a variety of in¬\nsights as possible.\nThe November issue of Twentieth Century Magazine,\nfrom London, is wholly given to TV as a medium, and I\nfound some help there. A brand new book, by Peter\nMcWhinney, The Art of Radio (Faber London) looks like a\nmost helpful discussion.\ncontinued.."
