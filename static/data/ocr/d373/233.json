  "text": "3\nthe relative progress and problems which exist. Commercial\ntelevision is inclined, as a result of the basic instincts of news¬\nmen, to emphasize the elements of conflict, the eruptions of\nviolence, the inflammatory statements of some racists. There\nare, despite many of the grave problems and even some of the\nindications of regression, some very encouraging conditions in the\ncountry today. There are many efforts and programs, not just by\nthe government but by private organizations and individuals through¬\nout the United States, to work with or help ghetto dwellers and\nNegroes. The \"good news\" should be given proper attention. And\nI think it can be presented in an interesting, as opposed to a\npreachy or pollyanna way.\n4. Above all, let me suggest that the station\nmanagers call in any and all contacts they have among Negroes\nand ghetto dwellers to discuss locally which programming ideas\nwould be most useful to bridge the gap between the races. The\nNegro, in each community, can best advise the ETA's of the\nmost effective and relevant ideas.\nSorry this is so rushed and rough, Chuck."
