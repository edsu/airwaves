However, I don’t think they\ndid what I have in mind as being needed.\nFinally, there are a hell of a lot of excellent college theatres\naround the country turning out fine products (plays). Heaven knows,\nETV needs more icing on the cake. A series of plays, probably in the\ndomain, could be brought off. Technically, it gets a little sticky\nas one contemplates the problems of getting the show into a TV studio\nfor VTR, but it*s not impossible. Again, NET has been into this, but\nthere isn’t enough, not nearly enough good drama on ETV. The local\nstation just can’t get it up on a regular basis. Takes too much time,\nstaff, and money.\nSo...there you are. You didn’t ask for this much, but I always\nhave trouble turning off the spigot. I don’t envy you as you receive\nall the good advice that must be coming your way. However, noblesse\noblige, and all that sort of thing.\nIMward Wegener\nDirector"
