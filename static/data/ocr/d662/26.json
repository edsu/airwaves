  "text": "October 1, 1952\nMr. Frank Schooley\nWILL, University of Illinois\nUrbana, Ill.\nDear Franks\nI was delighted to get your note of September 24th.\nI hope you will forgive me for throwing on your shoulders the\ntremendous job of administering the sale of THE JEFFERSONIAN\nHERITAGE pressings. We already have four of the shows in\ntest pressing form. There will be several changes made in\nthem so it is not likely that the complete series will be\npressed and ready for delivery until some time during the\nlast week in October. The method of operation that I propose\nis as follows:\nTou will handle all the funds and send me a list of those stations\nthat are entitled to receive a complete set of pressings. We will\nhave the pressings sent out directly from Columbia Transcripts\ntogether with the necessary promotional material, which may be\nod| assistance to the commercial stations scheduling the shows.\nI presume also that you are hahdling requests from schools and\nother institutiohs that would like to have copies. We will ship\non your order only.\nAfter a certain period of time the balance of the pressings will\nbe shipped to you at Illinois to dispose of as new orders come\nin from time to time.\nYou understand, of course, that there is a lien of approximately\n$1350. against the 100 sets of pressings which was advanced out\nof FAE promotion funds. Everything over that sum or approximately\n$1150. will be an addenda to the NAEB treasury. I will be forÂ¬\nwarding you the exact figures for having additional pressings\nmade which are infinitely leas than the cost of the original\n100 sets.\nLet me felicitate and congratulate you on the possible immediate\npublication of the Chicago and New York Studies. It would be\nwonderful if both of these could be released before the end of\nOctober."
