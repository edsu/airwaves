  "text": "Development, I propose that each state and\nlocality set aside no less than 2 per cent of its\neducation budget each year.\nOn the basis of an aggregate education\nbudget of $20 billion, this would amount to\nsome $400 million. This may seem tiny in\ncomparison with the sums spent by industry\nand defense. But it is enormous in contrast to\nthe $20 million — about one-tenth of one per\ncent of our overall school budget — now being\nspent on educational research.\nCan we afford such a Research and Develop¬\nment program in education?\nI would suggest that a far more reasonable\nquestion would be: Can we afford to go on\nany longer without it?\nWalter Lippmann put the matter clearly\nand concisely when he said:\n“We must measure our educational efforts\nas we do our military efforts. That is to say,\nwe must not measure by what would be easy\nand convenient to do, but by what it is neces¬\nsary to do in order that the nation may survive\nand flourish. We have learned that we are\n‘rich enough to defend ourselves whatever the\ncost.’ We must now learn that we are quite\nrich enough to educate ourselves as we need\nto be educated.”\nOver the long run, I am confident that re¬\nsearch in education would pay for itself many\ntimes over — just as research in industry has\ndone.\nLet me give you an example of how this\nmight work out in practice. Over the past\ndecade, the annual per-pupil cost of running\nour public schools has increased by more than\n70 per cent. Under conventional methods of\ninstruction, the prospects are that this rise will\ncontinue because the cost of instruction goes\nup almost in direct proportion to the number\nof students.\n12"
