Jim Kile#, locative director\nNational Association of educational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Jim:\nAfter considerable narrowing of our list and a great\ndeal of talking to people back Pnd forth, vie are making\ntentative plans to have Karl wynn meet Seymour Siegel,\nDick Hull, Burton Paulu, Wilbur Schramm, and me in\nWashington the evening of October 16 and the morning of\nOctober 17 for a lengthy discussion of the possibilities\nof his joining a is as our second executive Director*\nAll of the above plus Prank Schooley have expressed the\nopinion that Wynn is by far our besT> bet. Allen says\nhe feels that we should, not pull him into the Washington\nmeeting because of the distance involved. Frank is\nstill tracing some references on Wynn and the meeting\nKill not be definitely called until all of those\nreferences are in.\nThe reason for meeting in Washington is that Dick\nHull vdll be in Washington on the 16th on business and\nwe will not have to pay his expenses. Washington is\neasily accessible for 3i, Karl, and me. Only Wilbur\nand Burton will have a trip of any significance. All\nof the above mentioned except Wilbur have approved\nNAKB financing of this meeting. If you think further\nauthorisation for the meeting should be secured - by\na poll of the remainder of the Board - I will be glad\nto get it, but it does not strike me as necessary.\nI think I wrote you before requesting a reaction to\nWynn but should like to repeat that request sire© I have\nnot heard from you.\nI also indicated that Earl, if we decide to employ\nhim, will be available January 1. In that event, we\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
