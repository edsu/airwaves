Burrows\nChairman, NAEB Network Program Committee\nWUOM\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Ed:\nHere are my comments concerning Harold Hill's memo dated June 14, 1962 concern¬\ning the suggestion of John Finster regarding a new quarterly system.\nIt appears to me that any arrangement of the quarters is arbitrary, as the offerings\nbased on quarters of the year. The three months between new offerings seems to be\nquite adequate. Once a month offerings would involve too much work, and less fre¬\nquent offerings, say every six months, would probably mean a large lag between the\ninitial offering to network, and the use by network stations.\nIf the three month interval is judged to be adequate, then the next decision is - what\nthree months? There is a certain convenience in the present system, primarily because\nof the coincidence with the calendar. But I feel that this convenience is not enough\nto outweigh the validity of Mr. Finster's suggestion, not only for school stations, but\nalso for those of us who prepare program guides with long advance deadlines. The\n\"Finster\" plan would, in effect, present the offering one month prior to the convention¬\nal quarter system, so that stations having this long deadline would end up having to\nprogram in the conventional quarter, e.g.. Quarter IV (Sept.-Oct.-Nov. under the\n\"Finster\" plan) would be broadcast on many stations in October, November and Decem¬\nber. Clear? - hope so.\nTo sum up, if the administrative details are not too great, I am in favor of the Finster\nplan. It will present some problems as to the decision of which quarter will cover\nonly two months, but possibly this could be Summer of 1963.\nSincerely,\nHarold W. Roeth\nProgram Manager\nHWRrgwr\nThe non-commercial Metropolitan FM station of The Riverside Church in the City of New York"
