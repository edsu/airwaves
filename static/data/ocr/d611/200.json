C. 20554\nDear Bobs\nI*ve just today got around to reading the copy of your\naddress to the Seventh Annual College Conference of the\nInternational Radio and Television Society. It is ex¬\ncellent, in fact it is one of the best, one of the most\ninsightful analyses I have read anywhere of the nature of\nthe ghetto problem, the ghetto child, and the role that\ncommunications might play in rehabilitation and the devel¬\nopment of a two-way communication between these disconnected\nparts of our society.\nI wish your talk had been given at one of our regional\nmeetings or the national convention - not only because our\npeople need to hear this, but because * think it was prob¬\nably largely wasted on the audience you had for this occa¬\nsion. Our people have the potential to do something and\nI'm glad to say - as you can see from the attached memoranda -\nthat they are finally beginning to move.\nWe will spend a good deal of time on the ghetto-communications\ntopic at our national convention and, though I am not organiz¬\ning this section and am not sure what plans have been made so\nfar (our convention coordinator is in Europe at the moment),\nI certainly hope we can arrange to have you participate in\nsome way in this important discussion.\nCordially yours.\nWGH:lm\nEnc. 7\nWilliam G. Harley"
