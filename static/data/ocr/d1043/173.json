Howard, Secretary ' ^'Ty Oi- n\nFund for Adult Education ' '^s/s\n914 Ea3t Green Street\nPasadena 1, California\nDear Miss Howard:\nI have your two letters of November 6th and today I received\nthe check for $135,000. to which you referred in your letters. I do not\nexpect there will be any publicity given to this generous grant but I\nhave written Mr. Probst today stressing the point that, should there be\nany, he must send a copy to you before it is released.\nAs you know, the Fund for Adult Education has already re¬\nceived an accounting of my books for the year ending May 31, 1952, pre¬\npared by certified.public accountants. I am wondering if you wish the\nfinal $100,000. of the original $300,000. grant officially audited or if\nyou will accept the more informal type of report which Miss Perkins sends\nto Mr. Probst every month. I am enclosing our November 1st statement, on\nthe last page of which you will see that of the original $300,000. the\nsum of $291,703.35 has been disbursed.\nI understand from your letter that you will also want an\naccounting of the second grant of $150,000. before your meeting in May,\nand, unless 1 hear from you to the contrary, I shall send you a statement\nsimilar to the one enclosed. If, however, you will requre more formal\nreports, I shall, of course, be happy to make arrangements to secure the\nimmediate services of an auditor.\nWith best wishes, I remain\nYours very sincerely.\n/S/ Ralph Lowell\nTrustee of the Lowell Institute\nTO MEMBERS OF NAEB BOARD AND ADULT EDUCATION COMMITTEE:\nI plan to write a press release."
