The first\npostage bill you will receive will be mailed during the month of January, and will\ncover the four-month period from September through December, inclusive. Thereafter,\nyou will be billed on a quarterly basis.\nWe have worked out a form for keeping track of the postage for each ship¬\nment, and have had it in effect, on a test basis, for our own information, in order\nto get the mechanics set up, for the past couple of months, I am sure there will\nbe no difficulties in the mechanics of the procedure.\nThe Board has asked me to convey to the members of the Network their\nregret at the necessity to take this step, and their hope that all member stations\nwill be able to find some way to handle the payment of this additional expense.\nIt will help to enable the Network to live within its income, and thereby insure\nits continuanceo\nBy not starting this billing until after September 1 shipments, some\ntime will be allowed stations for making necessary budgetary and order adjustments\nand a full year will not be involved for this first year."
