In line with this aid, the initial pro¬\ngram, 3The Living Declaration,5 reviewed, spotlighted Jefferson’s part in writing of\nDeclaration of Independence.\n\"The entire aaries is based on the research, w riting and advice of Professor\nDumas Malone, of Columbia University.....Producer-director, Frank Papp, has show¬\ncased the professor’s material in laudable fadiion, with Wladiiair Selinsky5s majes¬\ntic background music particularly impressive. However, major credit for the series*\nsuccess belongs to actor Claude Rains.....\n\"The first show in the series registered msrdLmum audience impact, via Jeffer¬\nson5 s vain attempt to have an anti-slavery clause written in the Constitution and\nReins9 convincing explanation of Jefferson’s tolerant religious views.\"\n(June Bundy, Billboard, Sept. 20, 1952)\n\"Radio’s evaluation of Thomas Jefferson’s contributions to the free world—the\nhighly touted series produced by the National Assn, of Educational Broadcasters un¬\nder a grant from the Ford Foundation—got away to an impressive start (Sunday, Sept.\n14), to suggest that this series will have steady, and sharpened impact*\n\"A little pretentious and self-conscious in its scripting at the very start,\nthe premiere program got into proper dramatic focus very soon, however, by virtue\nof its subject matter and Claude Rains* fine performance as Jefferson. The meat\nand sincerity in this program, the easy though serious way in which it was presented\nas veil as the sterling quality of the acting performances, type this as a highly\nimportant series. It should be ’must1 listening for adults as well as all schoolrooms.\n\"Program was a combined narration-dramatization format, which had drama, bite,\nand vigor.\" (Variety, Sept. 17, 1952)\n\"The NAEB should be mighty proud of the job producer Frank Papp and his staff\ndid on their ’Heffersonian Heritage3 series. The quality of production and script\nare radio at its almost forgotten best—reminiscent of the glorious days of the\nold Columbia Workshop....\" (Ted Orson. Radio Daily, Oct. 21, 1952)"
