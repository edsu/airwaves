Sweet\nThe library of Congress\nWashington, D.\nDear Sirs\nYour letter of May 1, 1954 which you may have difficulty in recalling\nafter such a long time, was the basis for a discussion recently of your\nchamber concerts and intermission reviews. We had not forgotten you,\nyou see, but rather were bogged down in the somewhat usual committee\nconfusion.\nAt any rate, the NAEB Program Planning Sub-Committee met in Chicago\non December 3 and discussed, among many other programs, the Library of\nCongress proposal. The group felt that many member stations might like\nto avail themselves of the opportunity for such fine music and discussion\nby getting the tapes directly from TOMS. Because of scheduling and reÂ¬\nproduction problems, however, the committee did not feel that this is\na proper time to think about putting the programs on the tape network\nschedule.\nI would like to notify the entire membership through our Newsletter\nof the availability of the tapes from TOMS if you would be patient enough\nwith us to write again after all this time to let me know if the series\nis still available. Would you consider doing that; I'm sure many stations\nwould be delighted to carry the music and/or the book reviews?\nSincerely,\nKenneth D. Wright\nChairman, Sub-Committee on\nNetwork Radio Program Planning\nKDWjss"
