Ralph Steetle began in educational radio at Louisiana State University where he was its director of broadcasting, and helped build WLSU, one of the first educational FM stations in the south.  In the early 1950s, he volunteered to work for the Joint Council on Educational Television (JCET) as an associate director, but became its executive director when Richard Hull left.  The Joint Council on Educational Television served as an advocate organization for all the channels.  While working for JCET, Steetle worked on the FCC Third Report and Order.  This report tentatively set aside 209 frequencies, and became the Sixth Report of 1952, which then allowed 209 communities to speak to the FCC. The collection chronicles the early history of the Joint Committee on Educational Television and Steetle's involvement in this organization.",
