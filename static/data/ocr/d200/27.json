Your independent individuality was a refreshing\npart of that session. We were then far from being an organiza¬\ntional unit or homogeneous. The very fact of our varied points\nof view was characteristic of the fledgling NAEB. It is a credit\nto our professional pride and intelligent purpose that we have\nsurvived. You and others have helped build an organization that,\nin spite of its growing pains, has arrived. Had we not built\nNAEB, there would have now to be built such an organization.\nStructural and philosophical changes have and will have to be\nmade in NAEB as time goes on. You have affected some of the\nchanges and have had a part in shaping the image of NAEB. The\nSan Francisco Convention was a very real contribution on your\npart. Such sharing of ability and ingenuity is necessary if\nwe are to continue to grow and serve.\nThese remarks are to the point of saying that you are an impor¬\ntant and essential part of NAEB. Our associational success will\nbe accelerated with your continued participation.\nI hope that I hear in error that you have considered withdrawing\nfrom NAEB. Tell me if there is anything I can do to make NAEB\nbetter serve its purpose. Region II is having its 1963 Conference\nin Tampa, Florida, on March 29th and 30th. We will have a fine\nprogram and would enjoy your attending. Could you bring your\nwife and make a vacation of it?\nWith kindest regards, I am\nSincerely yours,\nRDH/lt\nRaymond D. Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager"
