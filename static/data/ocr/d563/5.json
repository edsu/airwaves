Armsey, Efege 2, August 26, i960\nIhe balance of the expenses listed were for a special project to\nmeet a need expressed by TV station managers almost unanimously:\nthe develqjsaent of Utilization ’’kite\" for classroom instruction.\nWe are proceeding with this project at our own expense, and are\nrequesting funds from the U. S. Office of Education to continue it.\nHowever, it is thanks to the funds from the Ford Foundation that\npreliminary steps and studies have been made which make it now appear\nlikely that this need can be met. Further reference to this project\nwill be found on page 29 of the 1959-1960 Annual Report, a copy of\nwhich is attached.\nWe had set ourselves the deadline of June 30 for expenditures from\nthese funds, and, as will be noted, this balance was fully exhausted,\nGfa behalf of the HAEB, and especially those educators who, through us,\nhave profited from your generous grants, I should like to express our\nsincere appreciation.\nSince a final report was earlier made on the grant here involved — with\nthe exception of the balance of $3,362.35, I trust no further report\nwill be needed. A copy of that report, as earlier submitted, is enclosed\nherewith, for your convenience, together with the MEB Annual.. Report for\n1959-1960, referred to above. If additional information is needed, I\nshall be roost happy to provide it.\nSincerely yours.\nHarry J. Skornia\nPresident\n- fkj\nBJS;J1\nEnclosures"
