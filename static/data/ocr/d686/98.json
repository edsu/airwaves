Hull\nPresident, HAMB\nRadio Station WOI\nIowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Dick!\nlust received the oopy of your letter to Marcus Cohn re¬\ngarding Bob Hudson*a suggestion to let TV stations transmit\nmusic alone whenever the licensee sees fit to do so.\nI haven’t given much thought to this, and /nay be wrong,\nbut it looks dangerous to me offhand* Television is simultaneous\neight and sound* If it is better it should be better for the\nadded sight. To relieve it of the responsibility of developing\nvideo techniques would seem to me personally (until I’ve studied\nit further at least) to be very unwise*\nEventually I see the day when sets, probably called \"Tele¬\nvision sets\", may have television, W and AM radio, and perhaps\nfacsimile. The owner oan select what he wants. But to allow\n‘TV to do what radio oan very well do, would seem again to be\nInviting monopoly, and inviting the big guys to swallow the\nlittle guys who oan only afford a radio or m station. To pre¬\nsent such a resolution to the FCO, at least without a meeting\nof Directors and officers in person, would I think be a very\nbad idea.\nIf the listener hears music from a TV station, on a TV\naudio frequency, hevll think he’s hearing TV, not FlI, no matter\nhow wrong we all may know he is. If the listener wishes to\nignore or tune out the video, he has the same rights do so\n. that listeners have to ignore co lercials* But for us to have\na part in making TV, at the sending as well as receiving end,\nanother divided attention or home background medium doesn’t\nseem right.\nIf we make it too easy for TV, it will not develop the TV\ntechniques needed, but will adopt radio techniques, and swallow\nradio not as TV but as radio, not because itbetter but because\nit’s bigger* lost of the people in TV now are not as desperately"
