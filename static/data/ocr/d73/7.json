Flanigan\n7515 3.W. 79th Crt,\nMiami 43, Florida\nDear Duff:\nSo 1 calls up the Vi1, of RCA and 1 says f have an able young man\nin mind for that job we've been drumming—I have him now but, not\nnecessarily for long; hence, we'd best get crackin'. He agreed.\nThree days later John Wentworth, in charge of educational services\nfor RCA, calls and says he % been directed to contact me and under¬\nstands I have somebody in mind. He says there's a new possibility\nfor raising funds—the Electronics Industry Association, hwhich has\nunderwritten a number of educational projects, i.e., Phil Leurs* book\non TV equipment. If this doesn't work out, sjrys he, then he will\nundertake to raise the money from among NAEB's industrial associates.\nThe former way, he slyly pointed out, would involve people who are\nnot presently in the membership.\nAll this, Duff, adds up merely to the fact that things are moving but\nwithout spectacular celerity. All I can do for the moment, then, is\nsay that there is still the possibility of a job here, but, as yet it is\nnot a reality. Meanwhile, do you have a resume mcollection of\nfibs about yourself that I can employ to bamboozle some unwary\nmanufacturers^? If not, please dream one up and send it along.\nBest regards.\nWGH/mmm\nWilliam G, Harley"
