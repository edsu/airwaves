  "text": "Skomia - 3*\nDick Wo r then of Berkeley, California, Arthur Poshay,\nand a good many others that anytime I am prepared to\ncome to Grade XI classrooms with my materials I\ncan have a two-week run. I do have the Syllabus\nsufficiently in hand to give it a run right away.\nI am now set, however, to produce at least one half-\nhour audio-visual item to be inter-woven with the\nSyllabus. This means that the Syllabus material for\nthat one half-hour can be reduced to a page or two.\nThis means a high degree of mobility and compactness.\nAnd that means that the number of places in which\nthe test can be run is greatly enlarged.\nThe Stanley Solomon Ph.D. thesis on the teaching\nof media in Grade XI used an almost exclusively content\napproach. He found to his amazement that his classes\nassumed that the content of all media was good and\ngood for them. This is an unspoken assumption about\nmedia content. % approach has the advantage of by¬\npassing this entire Maginot Line by the simple means\nof revealing structure, and the effects of structure.\nThe question arises whether understanding media in\nthis way obviates the need for drill and repetition.\nI think it does. Drill and repetition derive directly\nfrom the form of printing itself and the many senses\nof drill are amazingly related to the form of print.\nAt any rate it will be part of my test and dem¬\nonstration to discover whether this be true.\nPlease phone if there are matters that I should\nattend to at once, in addition to these, for the sake\nof the committee. For example, I can give the Syllabus\na trial run here in Toronto next week. I can have\nthat run covered by psychologists and testers like\nCarl Williams of this University. But I would prefer\nnow to wait for the kinescope to be made."
