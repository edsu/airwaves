Immediate need for in-school programs to be submitted for use on network\nThe In-School Program Committee of the NAEB urges all member stations to\nsubmit in-school series between now and May 1, 19$h» If you have one or more\nseries that have proved to be valuable for classroom use, we invite you to offer\nthem immediately.\nInterest in in-school series has grown rapidly during the past two years*\nReports at Norman last fall showed an increase from 30 stations using in-school\nofferings to U7#\nThis has been gratifying to all of us who believe in school broadcasting*\nThe boost comes at a time when we need it. Now the question is, can we continue\nto meet the demand that we have created? We can, if you will help us by sub¬\nmitting programs immediately to be considered for network distribution next year.\nThe increase in the use of school programs has made necessary a revision\nof the distribution schedule by Headquarters; hence, we have revised our own\nschedule for accepting programs as follows:\nAll programs to be reviewed by the committee next fall must be submitted\nto Headquarters between March 1 and May 1, 195U.\nPrograms selected from this group of entries will be distributed during the\nfall of 195k and the spring of 19!?5>> and may be used by stations at any time there¬\nafter.\nPlease note the enclosed submission blank with suggestions as to program\nrequirements. Additional copies of the submission blank may be obtained by\nwriting to the NAEB Headquarters, We shall look forward to receiving your sub¬\nmissions.\nSend: 1 tape\n8 copies of the submission blank\n8 copies of the manual for the series\nAddress to: In-School Program Committee\nNAEB Headquarters\n1U Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois"
