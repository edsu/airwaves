They\nappear to have the equipment and the backing to do it\nright. Bob Schenkkan seems to be a strong and able\nleader and a man I could work well with.\nI really want this job - even though the future with\nWelton Becket is an exceptionally promising one, it's\nnot the product I want to create or sell. I want the\nchance to build programs of especially high quality\nboth in content and production. A University such as\nTexas is an ideal place to do so - for my money.\nIf you have any suggestions as to how further the\nprocess of getting this job, I'd be delighted to hear\nthem.\nI look forward to seeing you again, Bill - hoping the\ninterval of time will be shorter than before.\nCordially,\nROBERT L. DAVY"
