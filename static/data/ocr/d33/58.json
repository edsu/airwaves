Of course, none of this would have been possible if the\nW. K. Kellogg Foundation had not originally provided the funds for the establish-\nment of a permanent XAEB Headquarters. Without this permanent organization, these\nadditional services would have been isyposslble to provide.\nOne of the most important, but least heralded, aspects of the work of the\nNAEB, is the day to day activities of the Headquarters. These include many ser¬\nvices to both members and non-members, such as the publishing of the committee\nreports mentioned earlier, answering requests for information and advice, distri¬\nbution of informational materials, the publication of the monthly Newsletter, and\nand many more. A copy of the latest Newsletter is attached as Appendix H, and\nAppendix I lists the more important materials that have been sent out with the\nNewsletter during the year,"
