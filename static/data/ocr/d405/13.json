There’s no magic way to produce suddenly enough food\nbut friendly skill is finding a way.\n12* WE WAIT TO make LIFE LIVABLE INSTEAD OF ENDURABLE, Most of the people of the world\ndon’t get much out of life according to our standards. But the odd fact is that the\nmore they get out of it the more we can get out of it*\n13• FRIENDLINESS TAKES PATIENCE. IT also takes courage. Hate and ill will die slowly and\ngood will must be tenderly nourished often at great risk.\nPROGRAM OFFERING"
