Hr* Tyler vas directed to study the problem and then give his estimate\nto Headqtiarters*\nIt vas also the understanding of the committee that '^reparation*' of the\nreports meant that the final edited copy would be In proper form tipon its\neubnission to Headquarters, for duplication and distribution by them*\nHowever, until funds are available. Hr* lyier, nevertheless, will take the\nccms^ittee reports as they now stand, duplicate them for distribution to\nthe participants, resource people, and Research Com.Tlttee members, and will\ncollect the remarks and com. ients made on each copy upon their return frm\nthese people.\nI hope that the balance ftm the Seminar is such that Hr* Tyler may be\ndirected by the Board to complete this phase of the piroject at an early\ndate*\nSincerely,\ncc* Burton Peulu\nI Keith Tylst\nHaymcnd D.
