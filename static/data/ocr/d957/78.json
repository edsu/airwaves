I have met Earl once or twice and then\nonly briefly, llty impression of him is very favorable. Further,\nI know a good many people who are aquainted with him and with\nhis work and their reports always have been good.\nThis is an important decision and I am sorry that I can’t help\nyou in making it. I assume that you have solicited a reaction\nfrom John Ivy, and if you have not done so, I would urge that you\nquery Professor Gordon Blackwell at Chapel Hill about Wynn,\nhis capacity to deal with people,and his capacity for intellectual\ngrowth.\nThe FAE’s committee on training in the mass media held its first\nmeeting last week and proposes immediately to make a few grants\nfor interneships while it continues to work on plans for a long\nrange program of training. I have drawn the assignment of coming\nup with some nominations of internees in educational radio and\ntelevision. If you have some suggestions to make of people who\ncould profit from an interneship experience, especially those\nin situations which are critical just now, I hope you will send\nthem on to me at once.\nBest **»»*»■•*'* «\nRobert B. Hudson\nDirector\nRBHtmjm"
