The reallocation he proposes is\non the left side and present allocation on the right* He wished it\nmade clear that this is not an official commission proposal but is\nhis own thinking on the matter*\nThe reallocation would provide 47 television channels, six megacycles\nvide between 60 and 342 megacycles* It would delete only channel 2\nof the present VHF bands and include all of present high band VHF\nchannels (7-13)• It would move the present FM band to the top of\nthe TV channels giving FM 342 to 362 me. It was stated that this was\na long range project which might take as long au 15 years to complete,\nhowever consensus of opinion was that the move was a good one - that\nit would bring all TV into the VHF band and due to ease of design of\nTV tuners might decrease the cost of all band TV sets considerably.\n3y proper choice of channels some space might be found immediately\nalthough the complete change would take time. However certainly the\nplan is a long rang© one of seme significance, which if accomplished\nmight well take care of television needs for the next 100 years as\nwell as providing better transmission for the mobile services, by\nmoving them to the 54 to 60 me band. This would also provide a\nbuffer zone from the practically dead 50-54 me amateur band which is\nnot usable because of the interference caused to the neighboring\nchannel 2 TV channel.\nC «S*B.\nCSBljy"
