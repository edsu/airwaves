  "text": "Incuiries From Commercial Stations\nCuite a number of incuiries have been received from\ncommercial stations about the possibility of their using some\nof the NAEB programs as public service fare. One foundation in\nTexas went so far as to offer a grant to the NAEB if some programs\nwere made available to them to offer on local commercial stations*\nThe standard reply to these inquiries has been that such\na procedure is not possible under the existing plan. This matter\nmust be decided by the board of NAEB0 We have maintained a file of\nthese incuiries and the stations have been told that we would\nnotify them of any change in this policy."
