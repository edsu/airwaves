Have\nyou had any reaction from Armand Hunter on this? It seems to\nme important to correlate this development with the North Central\nAssociation of Colleges and Secondary Schools which also has this\nunder advisement and has formulated a committee of which Armand\nand I are members.\nYou asked for the names of our officials in terms of the October\n26 meeting with presidents and superintendents. I have given\nSy Siegel this name but the President here is Dr. James H. Hilton\nwho may be addressed at 117 Beardshear, Iowa State College.\nI am not clear on one thing. You suggest that I personally or\nany of the rest of the people who received this memorandum con¬\ntact his president. It was my understanding the invitations\nfor this event would come from you or Siegel. I think it might\nhave more effect if the initial invitations were to come from\nthis source.\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hull\nRegion IV Director\nRBHidm"
