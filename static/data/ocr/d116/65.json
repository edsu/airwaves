  "text": "TO ALL OFFICERS AHD DIRECTORS OP HAEBi\nIn view of the emergency brought about by the television hearings,\nI have taken it on myself to authorize a fund-raising drive to be handled by\nprofessional fund-raisers, Messrs. Oram and Rich. These gentlemen have been\nrecommended by George Probst, and their fee is 10$ of the funds which are\nraised. Expenses of mailing, typing, etc. are extra*\nAs of this writing, we have received approximately $2100, which\nwill more than cover all expenses.\n7,000 copies of the enclosed letter and memorandum have been mailed\nout today to a selected list provided by the fund-raisers. You will note that\nall checks are to be payable to Mr. Griffith. Additional monies are being sent\ndirect to President Hutchins where tax exemption is a prerequisite as in the\ncase of foundations. I have asked Schooley to proceed with the filing of our\nMembership Corporation papers so that we can get a tax ruling from the Bureau\nof Internal Revenue. Due to the urgency of time, however, it has been necessary\nto have foundation grants made payable to the University of Chicago.\nIf any of you have any objection to this action, I wish you would let\nme know without delay. I have already conferred informally with many of you,\nand since it appears that we may raise something in the nature of $10,000., this\nwill be a welcome addition to RAEBâ€˜s treasury.\n11/21/50\nS. U. Siegel"
