It follows logically, therefore, that\neach of us should feel responsible for seeing\nthat these air waves are used to serve our\ninterests and needs, as well as those of our\nfamilies, our communities, and our nation.\n“On the other hand, the local broadcaster\nis required by law (Communications Act of\n1934) to operate “in the public interest,\nconvenience, and necessity.” This is an\nagreement which he must reaffirm periodi¬\ncally when he applies for renewal, of his\nlicense.\n\"When the broadcaster carries out this\nresponsibility to the people and when the\npeople become actively interested in the\nway in which their air waves are used, then\nwe shall have better radio and television.”\nNews of TV Programs\nABC—TV\nJohn Daly has been made vice-president\nin charge of TV news for ABC.

The following programs of news\nand discussion were rated excellent by the\nmajority in the 1953 Look-Listen Project.\nThese were the chief reasons given:\nEdward R. Murrow, 7:45 p.m., (EST)\nCBS, “Always says whether what he says\nis a fact or his own opinion.” “Reports all\nimportant facts, uncolored by personal bias.\nEach report means a statement by the of¬\nficial most closely connected with the hap¬\npening and often by an official in opposition.\nAnalysis, when given, is fair, logical, and\nintelligent.” “I like his calm delivery.”\nWorld News, Morgan Beatty, 7:30 p.m.\nNBC, “Reports by several reporters.” “Quite\nobjective, though sometimes shows prefer¬\nences.” \"Somewhat sensational manner of\ndelivery; otherwise good.” \"I like his using\nmen on the spot. But must we always have\nheadlines?”\nJohn Cameron Swayze, 7:45 p.m. NBC\n\"Excellent choice of events.” “Too Repub¬\nlican.”\nErwin Canham, Tues., 9:45, ABC,\n\"Points out positive, constructive phases of\neach side.”\nAdverse comments on news programs:\n“Stresses the sensational, and appears to\nput emphasis on strife and prejudice.”\n“Too many sensational or showy items.”\n“Highly emotional—appeals to American¬\nism, Patriotism, etc.” “Strives for the thea-\natrical and sensational; dramatizes every\nitem.”\nTown Meeting, Tues. 9:00, ABC, “Time¬\nly; gives different viewpoints.” “A thought-\nawakener.”\nCapitol Cloakroom, Fri. 10:05, CBS,\n“Gives candid opinions of public figures.”\nNorthwestern Reviewing Stand, Sun.,\n11:30 a.m., MBS, “Stimulating and informa¬\ntive. Assertions were explained.”\nMeet the Press, Sun. 10:00 p.m., NBC,\n“Frankness and directness.” “Questions in¬\ntelligent, pertinent.” \"Whole interview was\nconducted courteously.”\nWhat people want is easily discernible\nfrom the reasons for their preferences.\nThe Look-Listen Project\nSince the public domain of the air waves\nis leased, free, to private groups who pro¬\nmise to use them in “the public interest,”\nit behooves the public to do some thinking\nabout what IS iN ITS INTEREST. The\nthinking won’t get good programs unless it\nis expressed. One person s opinion has less\ninfluence with broadcasters than many\npeople’s. The Look-Listen Project is a\nmeans whereby many citizens can express\ntheir opinions at the same time.\nEach person participating is asked to rate\neight radio or television network programs,\non one station, 3-10 p.m. and tell why he\nso rated them. It is important that various\ncivic, religious, educational, and socially\nminded groups present the project to their\nmembers as something to help in. Radio\nand television are shaping our nation, and\nmembers will want to express their opinions\nwhere they will count. The results of the\nratings and opinions will be sent to spon¬\nsors, broadcasters, and the Federal Com¬\nmunications Commission.\nThe Look-Listen Project was- chosen, .by\nthe Council as the nation-wide effort on\nwhich all would this year unite, because it\nis already seven years old as sponsored by\nthe Wisconsin Association, and last year\nhad monitors in 16 states. Thus it has\nproved itself useful in all parts of the\ncountry.\nIt has also proved its influence. One sta¬\ntion responded, “The entire programming\nand management staff have read and re¬\nread your letter”; another, “We have made\nseveral changes in our programming, fol¬\nlowing receipt of your past survey.” Na¬\ntional sponsors say, “a very constructive\njob,” “a remarkably fine job,” “The listen¬\ner comments on all programs were highly\ninteresting,” etc.\nChoosing a Month\nOrganizations may. choose any month,\nOctober through March, as their Project\nmonth. However, it is hoped that most\ngroups will choose a month before January\n31. We want the 1954 Project Report to\nbe an effective voice of the Council; and\nonly returns reaching Headquarters by Jan.\n31 can be included in it.\nSend for your material early, please. The\ndirection sheet that goes to each participant\nand report sheets for the chairman are\nfurnished free of charge; the cards, at cost\n—3c for the eight cards each person needs.\nMoney will be refunded for unused cards\nreturned. So estimate the number of monitors\nyou will have optimistically. Send that\nestimate and your check to Mrs. G. F.\nMatthews, 4539 Winnequah Road, Madison,\nWisconsin.\nOther Local Projects\nIn the Look-Listen Project, network pro¬\ngrams are monitored. It is the big united ef¬\nfort of the year.\nWhen it is finished, local communities\nmay want to follow it with a monitoring\nof local programs or with other undertak¬\nings. It is hoped that local enterprises will\nspring up and thrive, and that accounts of\nthem will be sent to Newsletter.\nYoung Members of the\nCouncil\nThough the majority of members of this\nCouncil will undoubtedly be adults (college\nstudents among them) high school students\nare cordially invited to membership—as\nindividuals, as classes, as schools. There\nis work for them to do."
