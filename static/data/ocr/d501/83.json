SIEGEL\nDirector\nJOHN DE RROSPO\nExecutive Officer\nMay 21, 19&\nHr. Frank Schooley, Chairman\nRadio Program Planning C omit tee\nStation WILL\nTJrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nI have just received a cony of the Library of Congress\nproposal for a series of programs for consideration by our Com¬\nmittee •\nWNYC had been carrying these programs for the past two\nor three years through the facilities of the W Continental Network.\nNaturally, when Armstrone- support was withdrawn the entire network\nfell apart. The public's response to ^ie series was not vocal until\nthe service was discontinued. Then the brickbats fell..\nThe,programs musically were undeniably sofrce of the finest\nor their type. I wish I could say the same about the intermission\ndiscussions which were stilted, dull a*Vid long. If the manner of\npresentation could hive equalled the content it would have been a 1\nwonderful job. Certainly the participants were top rate.\nFrom the standpoint of artists' reputation and prestige\nof the intermission guests, a series of' this sort wo^ld be a definite\nasset to NAEB member stations, excellent recording job\nand is a pretty good outfit to3o^6nsiness with! \" '\nUnless I am completely mistaken, I believe Parker Wheatly\nwill bear out these views in his comments to you. If there is any\nother information which I may be able to furnish, please don't hesi¬\ntate to let me know.\nTills is the first opportunity for me to note your acces¬\nsion to your new post and I congratulate you most heartily. #\nWith all best wishes.\nCordially yours,\nm #\nBernard R.
