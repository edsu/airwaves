Monday morning at 8:00\na, m. will be fine for me. I hope to be able to\nmake it. X will look forward to seeing you and\nothers to share ideas again in our oonnon cause\nfor educational broadcasting*\nincidentally, Betty McKenzie sent me a copy of\nher note to you regarding my suggestion that l\nmight write an editorial for the magazine. She\nwrites me that the Committee adopted a policy\nagainst editorializing. I wasn't aware of this\npolicy, hut now that 1 know, X am 100 per oent\nfor it. i don't think the editor of the flAgB\nJournal should use the magazine to sound off\nhis views. Contrary to Betty's suggestion to\nyou. therefore, X would prefer that you not\nbring this matter up at the meeting of the com-\nmittee.\nWhat X actually had in mind was a short statement\ncommending Betty for the excellent work she is\ndoing, for the excellent cooperation the national\nofficers are giving the magazine, and for the\nincreasing interest being shown by our constituency\nas manifested by a larger number of good quality\npapers being submitted for publication in tne mag¬\nazine. Xf you believe this(and x am sure you do),\nperhaps you as Chairman of the Publications Com¬\nmittee would be the one to write this.\nin any case, X like the present policy of the\nCommittee, and, under no circumstances, would 1\nwant to change it.\nSincerely yours,"
