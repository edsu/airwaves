Inasmuch as the exhibit will be set down by the\nRailway Express at the point of display and inasmuch as the display has been\ndesigned for ease of erection, dismantling, and packing, we feel that the local\ncosts, if you do not have to pay for display space, will amount to §25*00 or less\nHence, for §50*00 or less, member stations can be assured of a beautiful exhibit\n•sdiich should do much to call attention to the fine programs offered on the Tape\nNetwork with particular emphasis on the new shows being dona by the NAEB Adult\nEducation Project* I hope you will all be able to use this fine exhibit.\nJim Miles"
