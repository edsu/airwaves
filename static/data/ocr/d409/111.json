Skornia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters *\nlU Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry,\nThe annual convention of the DAVI in Los Angeles last week seemed\nto be a success, although attendance was about half as large as it\nusually is when the meeting is held in the mid-west or in the east.\nThe organization is planning to write and to distribute to its member¬\nship a booklet on educational television. The purposes of the booklet\nare to show each member the stake of the audio-visual director in ETV,\nto describe organization of ETV work as a part of the authority of the\nA-V Director, and to limn some of the technical problems and costs of\nETV. The information is to be compiled in the Washington headquarters\nof DAVI, The question of Whether DAVI should seek help in this project\nfrom organizations such as NAEB and AERT was discussed. The sense of\nthe discussion was that the aid of other organizations is neither ne¬\ncessary nor especially desirable because the problems of A-V people are\ndifferent from those of other people. This attitude was more sharply\nexpressed by the rank and file members of the discussion than by its\nleaders. Careful missionary work seems to be in order.\nBest wishes to all of you there.\nCordially,\n-germeth Harwood\nFirst Vice-President, NSSC\nairmail\nkh:gb"
