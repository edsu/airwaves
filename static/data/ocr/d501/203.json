Oakenwald\nChicago 15, Illihois\nDear Dr. Kirk:\nIt always strikes me as a groping action to answer a letter received\nsome eighteen months ago, and not sent to me in the first place. But\n•your letter of Lay 28, 1S54 came to me, in copy, shortly after you wrote\nit. I made some comments on your series and heard no more about it.\nThis is an effort to revive your interest, which I believe must have\nflagged considerably by this time. At the time, I was a member of tho\nNetwork Planning Committee; at present, I am Chairman of it. and can\nassure you that any effort you make will lead to a definite decision\nand very shortly.\nI was and still am very favorably impressed by the 13 units you\npropose. I discussed the entire series as much as possible with tho\nbrief notes I had with the committee on December 3, The reaction was\nquite good and I was authorized to write you. w© would like to have a\nsample tape'of one ©f the programs as soon as you can provide one! If\nyou will send it directly to me, I will see that other members of the\ncommittee and the Committee on Acceptance hear it without delay.\nI personally hope very much that you have not lost interest in doing\nthe series for us or become otherwise engaged to the exclusion of time\nfo^ such a project. We all understand how likely such things are after\nthis lapse of time, but I want to make an attempt to work out the project\nwith you. I hope to hear from you soon.\nSincerely,\nKenneth D. 'right\nChairman, Sub-Committee on\nRadio Program Planning\nKDWsss"
