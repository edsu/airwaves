Dick feels that the ItABB should toiediatoly get a\ncomplete file of the facb~sheeteand have thorn bound with hard covers and\nadboseed with aonethlng suck as “Bsrsonal copy for use of Dr* lay Hall*\nDick thinks tot tills sort of gesture is quite important -** mid tot the\norganissaiion sliould go all out cm it*) hnyv^y. Hall - (Be must be quite'\na poker player — pl^rs a cool hand and hides Ids cards close to his belly.)\nHall in.dcaifed that Stone5 s |yrfjmxp function would be the clearLng-liouse\nfunction. Whether tide lets trie 11MB out completely, he did not say — but\nheld out no encouragement. I think you ought to ccotitiuo to f#llow up on\nit however* He had to specific tilings which he finally told me tlmt he\nwould like the KAHB to do. Both are research projects for which formal\nproposals should be rmdo if you want to do then. Ih© first was to discover\ntlio Modes to acceptance of tlio new media. The second project# which I boliove\ntlmt the 1IAEB is far more able to do, is to do research aimed at discovering\nthe best kinds of equipment, production, perfonianco, etc* for instruction^,\nbroadcasting * I believe tlmt by calling upon tlio meiiiership of the UAE8# using\nthe pooled experience which this represents, w© have a hell of a start on this\nlatter project alreaty* W siiggostiaa would b© an immediate proposal in this\ndirection. This would provide them with some helpful materials which they could\ndistribute early and thus show Congress that they arc already helping tlio\nschools* (This last Hoy did not say, but I would guess tlmt it is in the back\nof hie mind.)\nThis last sotfrids as though I trail trying to psychoanalyse Hall-which is\ncorrect# especially after he started to feel mo out on whether I was interested\nin becoming Director of the Title VII program — a result, I gator, of your\nputting a bug in his oar* Thin came as quite a surprise to no* Fortunately#\nho did not want an ievaedtato answer* This is for next June — if at all*\n®ils gives ise plenty of tire to think- give me southing to cogitate on\nat ni$vt ton I cannot sleep —* and it will ’probably b© to thing vArlch\nkeeps m from sleeping. What do you think of the idea?"
