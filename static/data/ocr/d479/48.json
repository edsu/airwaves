Rudolph\nOn Abstract Art and Abstractionist Painters\nBackground: In the Rue Campagne Primier, in the Montparnasse\nsection of Paris, there stands a tenement building which in any\nother city except Paris would be regarded as totally uninhabitable\nBut because its windows enjoy some of the best north light in the\ncity of Paris, it is the living quarters and studios of some of\nthe best working artists in the city. It was there that Milton\nMayer Interviewed Monsieur Edgar Pillet, one of the most dist¬\ninguished leaders of the modern French school of abstractionist\npainting. The translator is Mile. Rudolph."
