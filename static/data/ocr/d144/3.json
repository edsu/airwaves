University Village\nEast Lansing, Michigan\nDear Lee:\nYour letter dated January 22 was forwarded to me from NAEB\nHeadquarters in Urbana.\nYou are right in your premise that ETV stations, in general,\ncould do a better job in the area of public relations. Our\nexperience indicates a growing awareness of the importance\nof community involvement in station promotion and we feel\nour NAEB Public Relations Committee has done much to impress\nNAEB member stations of the vital role a carefully planned\nPR program should play in every station operation.\nConcerning your proDosed study: I am sure you are aware that\neveryone in business is weary (I am being kind; I could use a\nmuch stronger word) of graduate students* surveys. The feeling\nis that, in many cases, the professionals are asked to do the\nwriting for the student—and the result is, the survey question¬\nnaire is deposited in the round file.\nThe survey may be essential to your thesis; in fact, it might be\nuseful to the industry to have this information. However, if your\nthesis is to contribute anything really worthwhile, I feel it should\ngo a steo further and include a proposed public relations program\nwhich could be used as a blueprint by any ETV station that recog¬\nnized its importance.\nOur NAEB public relations committee preDared a PUBLIC RELATIONS KIT\nlast year which was a step in this direction, although not nearly\nas complete or detailed as your thesis would be if you follow ray\nsuggestion. The KIT might prove useful to you. It was designed\nfor NAEB members but I am sure it could be made available to you for\na small fee. Write Miss Betty McKenzie, Publications Editor, NAEB,\n119 Gregory Hall, Urbana, Illinois for the KIT.\nGOOD\nSCHOOLS\nDEVELOP\nGOOD\nCITIZENS"
