Subject to your permission, I want to dis¬\nseminate pootions of the letter in a Memo to^ Managers\nscheduled for March 3 mailing.\nIf productions from this series of grants do, in fact,\nwarrant national distribution, the facilities of the\ntape network could be made available — both for members\nand non-members — assuming minimal financial support\nfor distribution to non-members.\nPerhaps we*11 have an opportunity to develop some of\nthese ideas at WRTA. If not then, I hope we’ll have an\nopportunity for another visit prior to the time the\nadvisory radio committee convenes.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. MOtt\nRAM: lkl\ncc: Robert Swezey"
