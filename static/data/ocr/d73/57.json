Draw up a national plan for the comprehen¬\nsive development of educational television.\n2. Prepare detailed budget proposals for large-\nscale public and private financing.\n3. Establish general timetables for the build¬\nup of open-circuit and closed-circuit systems, plus\ntape-and-film libraries.\n4. Seek to enlist the wholehearted support of\nthe Department of Health, Education and Wel¬\nfare, the Foundations, and other interested prin¬\ncipals.\n5. Mount a massive informational campaign to\npersuade every American that failure to support\nthis effort will mean the forfeiture of our chil¬\ndren’s educational heritage.\nOurs is a task of formidable proportions. It can\nbe accomplished only if we pursue it with energy,\nintelligence and dedication. We must, all of us,\nkeep pushing buttons everywhere—and keep re¬\nsponding when our own buttons are pushed.\nThank you.\n10"
