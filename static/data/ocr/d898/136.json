While the system might begin on a less than\nfull schedule due to financial limitations, nevertheless,\nit would be essential that the participating key stations\ncommit themselves in principle to a complete schedule. A\n24 hour/day station operating schedule is ultimately\nenvisaged with the hours between midnight and 6 a.m.\ndevoted to repeat broadcasts and live presentations from\nthose parts of the world active at those hours? e.g., the\nmid-morning programs of BCC from London would make inter¬\nesting early a.m. program fare for the U.S. east coast.\nOf the 6 a.m. to 12 midnight daily schedule (a total of\n18 hours) the key stations would agree to carry up to\n9 hours at times and in blocks agreed to with the manage¬\nment of the system and up to an additional 6 hours of\nsystem programming each day at times within the day\nselected by the local station.
