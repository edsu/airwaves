Yo 10010\nDear Mr. barkeri\nThe National Association of Educational Broadcasters will\nfile a comment during the proposed rule-making against\ndiscrimination in broadcast employment.\nAs you may know, we have a committee of the Association on\nEmployment Practices which has been extremely active this\npast summer in gathering data on educational broadcasting\nstations' performance record in reference to employing\nminority groups and formulating recommendations for what\nshould be done to foster greater participation of such\npeople in our field via special recruitment and training\nprograms. We plan to publish a station handbook for\nsocial action which will provide guidelines to stations,\nboth commercial and non-commercial, about how they can\nimprove their activities in programming and employment with\nreference to members of racial minorities.\nSincerely yours.\nWGH s1m\nWilliam G.
