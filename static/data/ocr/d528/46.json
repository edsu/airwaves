Have talked with Estell and the NER Board will meet following\nthe October 28 Advisory Council meeting. We will have a late\naf ter noon- earl jry evening session designed primarily to react\nofficially to the detailed proposals presented at the radio\nadvisory meeting earlier in the day.\nI believe this catches me up with your excellent report.\nI hope we can set some dates in late September and early October\nwhere detailed planning can begin.\nSincerely,\nRobert A.
