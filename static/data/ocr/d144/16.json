  "text": "Mr. Marion Corwell\npage 2\nApril 16, 1963\nI realize that this does not entirely answer your questions,\nhowever, I think a questionnaire posing the question of Federal\naid to TV compiled from the various states through the members\nof NAEB would be a great asset in the furtherance of public\nrelations between the Federal government and the progress of\nETV. Of course, the other preliminaries used in a questionnaire\nof this nature with regard to a manâ€™s position in life, his civic\nactivities, etc. should be inserted.\nIf there are any additional questions you would like to\npose, please let me know. I might add that I have used in all\nof my talks to P.T.A. groups and clubs definite statements\napproving Federal aid in the field of ETV and thus far I have\nreceived no criticism. I am also certain it is acceptable by\nArkansas because we passed an appropriation for $250,000 Federal\nfunds, if and when available, by a vote of 86-0 in the House\nthis last Session.\nWith regard to the meeting at Columbus Institute this year,\nat this time I would say that it is possible for me to attend.\nHowever, should the meeting be set, I would like to know at\nlease 60 days prior to the meeting so that I can make the necessary\narrangements.\nBest regards.\nChairman\nEducational Television Commission\nTET/jm"
