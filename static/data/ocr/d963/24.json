  "text": "amount accumulated during each of the next three years would total $36,000 which would\npractically provide the funds indicated abosre as needed from Other Income.) To this we\nshould be able to add a few thousand more each year from the following: profit-making\nseminars, administrative charges on other foundation supported projects, sale of publiÂ¬\ncations, reimbursable services, etc. There is also, at present, approximately $65,000\ntotal surplus in the general NAEB Treasury and the Network account, which could be drawn\nupon in case the aforementioned sources of income did not materialize to the extent\nanticipated. It seems appropriate and feasible, if we are to look to a future at all,\nthat we should be willing to appropriate $10,000 - 15,000 from the reserves, in the next\nthree years, to keep the present operation going with a minimum curtailment of services.\nIf we do keep the operation going at approximately the present level, and educational\nbroadcasting enjoys the growth we all expect, the problem of support will be lessened\nas the movement grows and the Association will not have suffered a serious set-bach which\nmust be overcome. If, on the other hand, we put our heads in the sand and cut back too\nmuch (in order to save the present reserves intact) we may not be in a position in a few\nyears to assume again a more active leadership in the growing field. The Association\nhas made tremendous strides in the past eight years. It would be a shame to, in effect,\nwaste that progress by reverting to practical inactivity."
