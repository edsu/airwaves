Can we\nescape into understanding, as well as into success as it were?\nOBJECTIVES\nIn starting a syllabus for media instruction in high-\nschools, vie might assign as long-term objectives for such a\ncourse of instruction:\n(a) Identification of major media develop¬\nments in our environment, and their\nrelation to new science and technology,\n(b) Familiarity with the various and often\ncontradiotoiy qualities and effects\nof media.\n(c) Greater awareness of ways in which\nwords, concepts, and data may be\nused, or misused, in the handling of\nmedia matters.\nOne reason for the greater awareness of all media matters,\nwhich we now take for granted, is quite simply the co¬\nexistence and constant inter-action of many media in our\nordinary environment. What we might call the climate of educa¬\ntion has undergone radical change because of the co-presence\nof several major media. Their daily operation upon one another,\nas in the mere use of newspaper or the use of the telephone."
