  "text": "- 4 -\nRetirement Benefits - Supplement\nAt the time Harry J. Skomia (President) and Harold E. Hill (Administrative\nVice President) were employed, the entire Headquarters staff was considered\na part of the University of Illinois and all members of the staff were\nthus participants in the University Retirement System.\nSince participation in the Retirement System was considered to be an\nadditional inducement to remain with the HAEB, so far as the President\nand Administrative Vice President were concerned, the NAEB Board of DirecÂ¬\ntors decided that, when the Headquarters operation was removed from the\njurisdiction of the University of Illinois, retirement benefits, in cash,\nshould be paid to Messrs. Skomia and Hill at a rate equivalent to the\ncontribution paid for them into the Retirement System by the HAEB. This\nincrement amounts to 8.477$ of the base salary paid to each of these men.\nHEH:jl"
