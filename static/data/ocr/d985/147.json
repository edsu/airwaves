These admin¬\nistrators will meet at Spokane, Washington,\nand Allentown, Pennsylvania, this fall in\nregional drive-in conferences sponsored by\nA AS A, the NEA Department of Rural Edu¬\ncation, and the Council of Chief State School\nOfficers. Other professional organizations,\nagencies, and institutions in each region are\ncooperating.\nNorthwest Conference\nIn the Northwest Regional Drive-In Con¬\nference on Community School Administra¬\ntion, which will meet in Spokane, Novem¬\nber 17, 18, and 19, superintendents from\nIdaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington\nwill be looking for hints and helps to make\nteaching better. Carl Jensen, superintend¬\nent of H i g h 1 i n e\nSchool District, Se¬\nattle, Washington,\nas general chairman\nof the conference, is\nshaping up the pro¬\ngram details. He has\nthis to say about the\nSpokane conference:\n“Talk to almost\nany administrator in\nthe Northwest re¬\ngion about his work,\nand nine times out\nof ten he will tell\nyou he believes that leadership in improv¬\ning instruction is his most important re¬\nsponsibility. Yet despite this belief he is\nmore likely than not to tell you that he is\nnot meeting this responsibility nearly as\nwell as he ought to meet it.\n“Planning, constructing, and equipping\nschool buildings, developing and adminis¬\ntering the school budget, employing a school\nstaff, keeping the public informed about\nwhat the schools are doing, and the hundred\nand one other jobs that must be done to set\nup the school organization and keep it under\nway, keep the superintendent’s nose so close\nto the grindstone that he has little or no\nenergy left to devote to the all-important\njob of instructional improvement.”\n“In this conference,” Superintendent Jen¬\nsen says, “we are trying to learn how to\nget out of this dilemma.”\nC. C. Trillingham, AASA president¬\nelect, fresh from two years’ experience as\nchairman of the AASA commission for the\n1957 yearbook, The Superintendent as In¬\nstructional Leader, will keynote the confer¬\nence. Dean Zeno B. Katterle’s general ses¬\nsion address on “The Inservice Education of\nSchool Administrators” will be another high¬\nlight.\nIn smaller discussion group meetings and\nthrough special reports of actual experience,\nthese school administrators will get down to\nsuch practical problems as taking stock of\nactual educational needs, developing com¬\nmunity readiness for improving instruction,\nusing research findings to make teaching\nbetter, the job of the principal as an in¬\nstructional leader, and effective staff com¬\nmunication.\nConference at Allentown\nThere is another brand new drive-in con¬\nference in the making. Superintendents from\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and New York will\nmeet, November 14, 15, and 16, at Allen¬\ntown, Pennsylvania, in the first drive-in\nconference in this middle-states region.\nNow that this conference is a reality, or\nalmost a reality, it must have a name, and\nwhat to name it has become a perplexing\nproblem. There has been no lack of sug¬\ngestions. Seems like everybody wants to\nhelp. Just to mention a few of the helpful\nhints—the Lake Erie Conference, since all\nthree states border on Lake Erie; the Middle\nStates Conference, since these three states\nare midway between something or other;\nthe Tri-State Conference, mainly because\nthat was an easy name to think up; and the\nPONY Conference, which is one of the first\nof the alphabetic discoveries, so common¬\nplace in recent years, we have seen that\nmakes sense.\nAnyway, there is a new drive-in confer¬\nence coming soon with a bang-up program\nunder the leadership of Superintendent\nJohn S. Cartwright of Allentown, Penn¬\nsylvania, chairman; John H. Moehle, su¬\nperintendent of Onteora Central School,\nBoiceville, New York; and W. E. Weagly,\nWill You Help AASA Grow?\nNEW MEMBERS who join NOW for\n1958 will be placed on our mailing\nlist for all publications for the balance\nof 1957 and receive a paid-up mem¬\nbership for 1958 besides receiving one\nyearbook, of their choice, free as a\nspecial bonus.\nWhy not invite a nonmember to join\nAASA now?\ncounty superintendent of schools, Sandusky,\nOhio. Attention will be focused on such prob¬\nlems as school building needs, school legis¬\nlation, personnel practices, and school pub¬\nlic relations.\nAmong the high¬\nlights of this con¬\nference will be gen¬\neral session ad¬\ndresses by Professor\nNorton Beach, of\nTeachers College,\nColumbia Univer¬\nsity; Lewis Harris,\nexecutive secretary\nof the Ohio School\nBoards Association;\nR. Merle Eyman,\nJohn Cartwright assistant state su¬\nperintendent, Colum¬\nbus, Ohio; and Mayor Donald V. Hock of\nAllentown.\nIn a series of special reports, superin¬\ntendents in this region will share their ac¬\ntual experiences with movable school build¬\nings, financing building programs through\nstate authority, buildings without corridors,\nmunicipal: annexation for school government\npurposes, recruitment practices, and orienta¬\ntion programs for new teachers.\nTHE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR\nVol. 15, No. 1, September 1957\nAmerican Association of School Administrators, NEA\n1201 16th St., N.W., Washington 6, D.
