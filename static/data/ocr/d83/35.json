The office of Health, Education, and Welfare also sent\non a legal item concerning the matter of grants being mad e to\norganizations and not to individuals. In a sense,this\nperplexes the issue somewhat further insofar as our internal\nrevenue department is concerned • There is nothing on their\nbooks to cover such a case. They have no more to say than\nthat educational grants are tax free. The whole matter,then,turns\nupon my relation to the NAEB. Was I an employee,o r was I,\nin QffQct» the receiver of an educational grant? I think a\nsharp lawyer could manage the matter quite easily since the\nNAEB is an educational and non-profit or ganization, distributing\nto its investigators purely educational funds, which the said\ninvestigators in practice have applied for. In a word, it is\npure;y a matter of technicality at this end • The spirit\nand intent of our law are in no way designed to tax anybody\nin my position in regard to you.Now it is merely in the\nmachinery of handling and distributing these grants that our\ntax officials find confusion and uncertainty. The entire intent\nof our own legislation is nullified by the accidental features\nof bmu£$ratic administration in the United States.\nThe fact, of course, that educational grants are not taxable\nin Canada is not unrelated to the great scarcity of such grants\nin this part of the world.\nOl"
