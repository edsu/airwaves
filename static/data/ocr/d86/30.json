Television broadcasting is making traditional jurisdictions in\neducation obsolete. To date there are 45 educational television sta¬\ntions either on the air or planning to start operation later this\nyear. Teaching by closed television circuit already has provided much\nexperience in the best ways of using TV for instruction in schools and\ncolleges.\nWith this growth comes an increasing demand for policy decisions on\nboth television applications in education and its long range support\nprovisions. Many of these decisions will have to be made at the level\nof state government. You are probably aware of the legislation now\nunder consideration in Washington to provide assistance to the states\nin fostering the creation and growth of educational television stations.\nSome of the bills under consideration make provisions for statewide sur¬\nveys to predetermine the most effective use of the funds. Some require\nmatching fund provisions by state or local entities and all require sub¬\nadministration by state bodies in their use. An advisory committee in\nthis important field can hasten these decisions and assure equitable allo¬\ncation of any funds that might become available.\nI am proposing to reactivate the Governor's Advisory Committee on\nEducational Television and I would greatly appreciate your accepting\nappointment to serve as a member of this committee.\nI am enclosing a list of persons whom I am inviting to serve as members.\nWill you please let me know whether you will find it possible to accept\nappointment as a member of this committee.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Edmund G. Brown\nEDMUND G. BROWN, Governor\nEnclosure"
