Commentaries of Dr. Schmitt from various capitals of countries participating\nin the European Coal and Steel Community or maintaining accredited missions thereto\n2. Interviews with leading individuals who are either directly concerned with the\ncommunity or who are notably pro or anti ^European.1'}\n3. Reports from sites and locations which represent in some unique way the\nachievements or problems of integration: places of relocation of workmen, such\nas the steel producing areas of Lorraine, which have absorbed workers from central\nFrance, where inefficient coal mines had to be closed as a result of integration,\nthe Saar, which will be returned to German control, etc.\nThese recordings will be made in Europe and forwarded to WNAD which will screen\nthe tapes for quality."
