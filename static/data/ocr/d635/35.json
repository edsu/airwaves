I hope that next year we will e able to divert ore money for\nresearch than we have been able to do this year because of the emphasis\nthat was placed upon research in the original grant* In this regard# by\nthe.way, wouldn't it be & good idea for you. to write : 11 : 1. ©di&tely\nand request th t he begin right away the comparative analysis that bllbur\nsuggested, balancing BAI3 operations. (st tion logs, personnel, otcf) of a\nyear ago with a ccKapsrable week at this -point# hy guess would be that Balias\ncan dr: this with the aid of one part-time cretary for a couple of months\nat very little cost to us.

It will take\nsome time.\nAfter this last meeting, I begin to feel that our operations are not\ntil just something we are planning to do but 1 am sudceutly aware that wa\nhave accoe^lished a great deal and now have scmo thing to show. I%ch of\nthis accomplishment may be attribute a directly to your leadership, tc\nyour being one jump bead in the thinking and planning#\nTurning to more immediate matters, do you want me to plot the agenda\nfor the Columbus meeting or will you? If the former# please compile a\nlist of subjects which you feel must be covered at Columbus -.nd we can\ngo over them at the Oklahoma meeting* If I am to be responsible for\ndrawing up the agenda# I will write each member of the Board about the\nmiddle of March ..sking for suggestions for the agenda and then compile\nthe agenda from those suggestions, as well rs suggestions Tom you# Jim#\nand from my own thinking* The Columbus meeting will be a rough session"
