  "text": "TO: NAEB Board of Directors Item No. 12\nFrom: Frank E. Schooley\nRe: Authority to Cancel Memberships and Bad Debts for\nNon-Payment.\nThere are a number of accounts on the N.*EB ledger\nfor non-Dayment of dues, non-payment of Newsletter subscriptions,\nand a few miscellaneous items. These should be removed in\norder to bring our books into better shape, give us a better\npicture, and make it easier on the Treasurer.\nWe have a few accounts that have run three and four\nyears. We should no longer count or carry such. In some\ncases membership was taken out by an interested individual\nand the institution now ignores our billing. I think we\nshould get these off the books after appraisal of individual\nsituations, providing this action is indicated.\nI recommend that the Treasurer, the President,\nand the Executive Director be authorized to cancel such\nbad debts providing that cancellation of memberships for\nnon-payment of dues be reported to the Board of Directors."
