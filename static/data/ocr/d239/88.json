Also, X indicated that we had\nresolved the questions X had had in mind earlier in the day*\nIt’s my understanding that all rights in the\npresentations and the recording® prepared by you or under\nj^our direction in this project are to be retained by the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\nAll personal services paid from the grant are to\nbe paid by the HASB Treasurer subject to deductions for\nincome tax and social security, as required by law* As I\nexplained, this is not a decision of NASS but that of th®\nInternal Revenue Bureau, W® must deposit withholding amounts\nmonthly, make quarterly and annual reports regarding such\nservices and sums Involved,\nI appreciate the fine way in which you kept the\nrecords on the current project, all of which are entirely\nsatisfactory with me. Personally I would be happy to let\nthe personal services for the next project be paid without\nall the difficulties imposed on us. It’s just extra work*\nUnless there is .a compelling reason indicated to\nus by th® Rockefeller Foundation X see no reason why you\nshould not keep the small balance until the next part of the\nproject is put in motion®"
