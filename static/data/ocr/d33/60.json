However, this\nyear, all program series submitted to the network have been auditioned, and the\nselection made, by the committee, this has resulted in a more satisfactory oper¬\nation and has brought about a general up-grading of programs offered by the net¬\nwork. this procedure has also resulted in the need and use of more tapes, be-\noause so many are required to send audition copies to the several members of the\ncommittee.\nlhla y®ar> through a special grant from the V. K. Kellogg Foundation, the\nKAKB was able to purchase a new mass dupliaator and, also, to have the original\nduplicator returned to the manufacturer for badly needed repairs, The new dup¬\nlicator, plus improved operation of the old one, hat resulted in better service\nto the network members. It has increased the number of tapes that can be a.~n.e\nand has assured a butter technical quality. Vithout this special grant the\noperations of the network would have been greatly hampered. This special grant\nalso included funds for the purchase of approximately 1,000 new tapes which were\nbadly needed and are now already in use.\nAppendices J, K, and I give evidence of the expended activities of the netwerk\nand show the present tape status."
