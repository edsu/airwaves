  "text": "President Charles E0 Friley\n2\nHay 13, 1952\nMr. Ralph Steetle of the Joint Committee on Educational Television\nindicates the American Council on Education would very probably like\nto endorse this conference and offer any assistance possible as well\nas the JCET itself.\nWe would propose, on the basis of recommendation by the subcommittee\n(Marvin, Lorch, and Hull) and the general committee, to have a 2-day\norientation session idxich would attract perhaps 100 or more people and\nto follow this up with a workshop for a more restricted group which\nwould proceed on a seminar basis to examine some of the problems more\nclosely.\nDr. George Town really keynoted the concept of the conference when he\nsaid, \"Iowa State is the only institution with actual experience. We\nshould endeavor to base our conference on that fact.\"\nIn addition to the $1,500 anticipated from the EASE it is estimated\nthat an additional $2,500 would be required either from General College\nFunds or from W0I-T? Ford Foundation Research Funds or both to handle\nexpenses of some consultants in the engineering field, some FCC personnel,\nand an attorney in addition to costs of printing, etc.\nWe are requesting your tentative approval for this proposal in order\nthat we may negotiate more effectively with the NAEB and Kellogg people\ntomorrow.\nSincerely yours,\nRichard B. Hull\nRadlo^T? Director\nJoseph H. Worth\nCoordinator of Radio\nand TV Education"
