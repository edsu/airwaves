Large-class instruction in some subject fields has released other\nteachers to give more time to smaller groups in basic needs, such as remedial\nreading, mathematics, counseling, increasing use of libraries, etc.\nDADE WILL CONSTRUCT ANOTHER STATION\nThe Dade County School Board is applying to the Federal Communications Commis¬\nsion for a permit to build and operate a second ETV station! Just not enough hours in the\nday for its one station -- WTHS, Channel 2 -- to meet all the needs. Pittsburgh and\nOklahoma City Schools already operate two ETV stations in their areas.\nIN SEVEN COUNTIES OF THE PINELLAS-HILLSBOROUGH AREA, Director\nThomas Rothchild of the in-school instructional program broadcast by ETV station WEDU\nChannel 3, Tampa-St. Petersburg, says that among 27 schools in that area using educa¬\ntional television, there was a net instructional saving of $180, 000 last year and a class¬\nroom construction saving of $430, 000.\n\"With educational television, \" he sums up, \"we can teach more children more\neffectively -- and save money doing it! \"\n(Of course TV does NOT -- and cannot -- \"replace\" classroom teachers.

THE EXTENSION OF ETV IN FLORIDA\nThe ETV Commission and the STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION will soon\nannounce plans for submission to the 1961 Legislature for proposed extension of ETV\nservice to more county school systems and public institutions of higher learning.\nAmong other proposed extensions, the ETV Commission is working with a recently"
