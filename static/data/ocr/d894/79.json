C„\nBear Marcus §\nThis letter is to tell you that the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters has decided to withdraw from appearances in the so-called\n•Mayflower* hearings before the FCC.\nThis, as you well know, is an extremely complex issue or sequence of\nIssues. Apparently there are sufficiently varying points of view\nwithin the NAEB membership so that a joint statement would not be\nreadily feasible.\nAfter conversations and correspondence with people at the University\nof Minnesota, the University of Illinois, Including Harold Engel,\nHarold McCarty, Frank Schooley, Wilbur Schramm, and many others, it\nappeared wiser to withdraw.\nThe public notice of the FCC regarding this hearing, giving the order\nof testimony indicates that such people as Nathan Straus of WCMA* the\nInstitute for Education by Radio* Ce A. Slepmaa, The American Civil\nLiberties Union, and others together with several of our own members\nsuch as WILL (University of Illinois), WHCU (Cornell University) and\nMorris Novik, NAEB Secretary have filed for appearances.\nIt would appear that the basic tenets of our composite points of\nview will be represented whether or not the organisation appears\nitself—and—as we previously discussed it—unless unanimity is\npresent* it is likely to detract, not add to NAEB stature.\nSincerely,\n/«/ Richard B. Hull\nRichard B. Hull\nPresident - NAEB\nRBHsmp\nees ■ All NAEB Officers\nAll NAEB Birectors\nEdwin Helman, WBOE (AES liasion)\nWilbur Schramm\nHarold Engel\nBirectors of Clear Channel Station* (NAEB)"
