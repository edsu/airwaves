  "text": "Storage of Archival Copies\nThe undersigned has talked to Mr, Downs and Mr. Stone of\nthe Library School about the possibility of storing NAEB file\ndiscs in the Quarters provided for the Library School collection.\nThis is agreeable to then: Provided funds are made available\nto purchase the necessary, shelving* This would be a temporary\nmove pending a permanent solution—the solution being mostly\na matter of space and funds for shelving and cataloguing,\n(See copy of letter attached.)\nThe matter of retaining file copies of NAEB programs was\ndiscussed when the headquarters was moved here* it is felt\nthat an archival file is of extreme importance. The material\nwill have some historical value in the future, and a fair\namount of it is significant material with permanent usefulness.\nIt is the fond hope of the present manager that some day the\nUniversity will operate a complete library service of recorded\nmaterial. Such a library should contain many of the NAEB programs\nWhether the file should be on tape or disc is still a matter\nfor discussion. We have tentatively started to make them on discs\nDiscs are perhaps a little easier to store permanently, we are\nshore of tape, and Discs are a little bit cheaper. We are holding\nall programs until such time as discs are cut.\nIn view of the abo\\e the undersigned strongly recommends\nthat funds be furnished to buy the necessary shelving so that\nthese'” file discs can be stored in the library.\nManager-\nNAEB Tape Network"
