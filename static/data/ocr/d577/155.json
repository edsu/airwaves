No other organisation, to our knowledge, has through the years so\nstubbornly insisted that there are essentially equal roles for both media to play,\nand that both can be eminently useful, if the educational needs of the nation are\nto be served and the realities of educational financing are to be faced. Therefore,\nthese two electronic media, with such related potential developments as facsimile,\nmultiplexing and stereophonic broadcasting, are approached together, rather than\nseparately, in isolation, or unrelated to all the other materials of instruction which\nare available.\nOptimum use of television and radio for education also requires the maxi¬\nmum possible knowledge of films and all other audio and visual aids, as well as\nof the learning theories involved in the uses of any \"tools** for teaching. Radio\nis a synthesis of all known aural methodology and fools, as well as offering the\nadvantage of immediacy and emotional reinforcement of the intellectual. Tele¬\nvision provides a synthesizing factor and force for ail the visual as well as aural\naids and techniques so far available, as well as sharing with radio the new dimen¬\nsion of immediacy r- a dimension greatly needed at a time when textbook chapters\ncan be made obsolete virtually overnight. The utmost cooperation with ail other\nmedia organizations is requisite in the development of teacher-training courses,\nparticularly, in this field."
