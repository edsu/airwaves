  "text": "The Fund for the Advancement of Education informed me on\nJune 9 that they are providing me with a travel grant so\nthat I can spend the year from September 1958 to August 1959\nIn the United Kingdom and on the Continent continuing my\nresearch into European broadcasting* I learned today that the\nUniversity of Minnesota will give me a sabbatical leave,\nthus enabling me to accept the grant from the Fund* Accordingly,\nmy family and I will go abroad in September*\nAll this, unfortunately, will require me to resign from\nthe presidency of NAEB* I leave Saturday, June 14, for Los\nAngeles, to spend si?, weeks teaching at the University of\nSouthern California* We should return here about August 10*\nThen, after three or four hectic weeks, we shall set out for\nLondon* Adding the European trip, on very short notice, to\na summer in California, puts my family and me on a schedule\nthat is positively cruel, and which will leave insufficient\ntime for anything like adequate attention to the affairs of\nIfAEB* Therefore, in fairness to the organization as well as\n[to myself, this resignation had better take effect immediately*\n1 shall, of course, be available for consultation with my\nsuccessor, and shall make every effort to answer my mail and\ntelephone between now and September 1* But circumstances\nclearly will limit what I can do for NAEB during the next\ncouple of months*\nTlJ3 thought of resigning from the NAEB presidency disturbs\nme. While I am very happy over the study opportunities made\npossib'.e by the FAE grant, I naturally hesitate to leave this\noffice before the end of my second term* The members of NAEB\nhave elected me to office on eight occasions: secretary\nthree times, vice president twice, regional director once,\nand president twice* NAEB, therefore, means a great deal to\nme* Unfortunately, I never have been able to give NAEB as\nmuch as it deserved. The president should work full time on\nthe affairs of the association alone* Yet, as director of a\ngrowing radio-television department at the University of\nMinnesota, I frequently have had to stop long before the NAEB\njob was finished® But, with the kind of cooperation which\nhas been so freely given by our capable officers and\ndirectors, our various hardworking committees, and our devoted\nHeadquarters staff, I feel that we have continued to make\nprogress during the past eighteen months*\nEven though this will be my last communication as\npresident, my interest In NAEB will continue, and I shall\nremain available to serve the organization and its cause in\nevery way possible* During the next ten weeks, I shall do\nwhat I can to help my successor take over the functions of\npresident* In Europe next year I shall always be ready to\nrepresent the organization in every way possible* And upon\nmy return in the fall of 1959, I shall be available for what¬\never duties the then-president wishes to assign me*"
