SIEGEL\nWNYC, Municipal Broadcasting System\n2500 Municipal Building\nNew York 7, N. Y.\nMr. Frank Schooley\nRadio Station WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Franks\nNovember 23, 1951\nOf*\nAs our expert on ihe Constitution and By Laws, will you give me\nsome advice — and quick? {J\nI was ready today to mail out your proposal about changing Article VI,\nSection 2, of the By Laws, but upon looking into Article XII, I found\nthat such an amendment is only to be submitted ‘‘provided at least\nthirty days advance notice is given in writing to the members before,\nactual voting is taken upon any proposed changes.”\nNow, Irank, having heard you cry out in stentorian tones at our\nconventions, wYou can‘t do that—its unconstitutional!1^ I shudder to\nproceed now without your prior approval. True, your proposal was\nsubmitted to the membership at the Biloxi meeting, but it was submitted\norally not in writing.\nShould I now (a) assume that the reading at the November ij. meeting\nmeets this requirement, and that if I circulate these proposals on or\nafter December 1* the members may properly vote on them; or (b) should\nI mail out a statement as soon as possible, notifying the members in\nwriting of the intended amendment? In the latter case, I could either\nenclose the ballots you prepared, with the request that they be\nmailed back thirty days later (which may not be strictly according to\nrule, and in which case many of the members may misplace their ballots)\nor I could mail out the ballots thirty days thereafter.\nAdvice please, Mr. Schooley 1\nWill you also help me out on this one? I have before me an application\nfor membership received from the Pacifica Foundation. We voted this\ngroup into membership at our Biloxi meeting. Our practice in the past\noftenhas been to charge dues effective on the date of original\napplication which in this case Pacifica applied in October. But it\nseems to me that their dues paying liability should take effect only\nafter they are admitted and have access to all of our services —\nsay December 1, 1951 — rather than on the date they originally applied\nWhat do you think about this? I am going to notify them officially\nof their election to membership in a day or two. May I hear from you.\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
