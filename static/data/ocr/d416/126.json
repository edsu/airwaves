Weather maps are one method of studying the weather — they show\nthe high and low pressure areas all over the country. Other information shown on\nweather maps includes wind direction, kind of precipitation, and temperature.\nThings to Do;\n1. Try forecasting the weather in the following ways: guessing, observing clouds,\nkeeping temperature records, using a barometer, studying weather maps.\nSources:\n1.

The moon is the nearest body to the earth.\n2. The moon revolves around the earth..\n3. The moon causes tides and eclipses.\nThe moon is the nearest body to the earth — over 200,000 miles away. The moon\nrevolves around the earth in a little less than a month, always keeping the same\nside turned toward the earth. There is probably no atmosphere on the moon.\nScientists have studied the surface of the moon which is turned toward the earth,\nand have found that it has many mountain chains and craters. The moon causes an\neclipse of the sun when it gets in a line between the sun and the earth. Tides\nare caused by the sun and moon pulling at the earth.\nThings to Do;\n1. Use a flashlight and two round objects in a darkened room to demonstrate solar\nand lunar eclipses.\n2. Study photographs of the craters of the moon.\n3. Observe the quarters of the moon.\nSources:\n1. Parker - ”The Sky Above Us”\n2. Fletcher - Earth Science\n3. Smith and Jones - Enjoying Modern Science\n4- Carroll - Understanding our World\n-6-"
