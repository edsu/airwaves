New York\nMy one sm/lli critlCism\\of this is that the interviewer,\nAlraa,TJ?tt?lng»r, is \\a bit \\on >he gushy side.\nHowever,il like the putpo^e and the general presentation\n/cyf the sefriesV I particularly like the idea of empha¬\nsizing sonix or-th* lesser-known but constructive and\ndifo£t«rof the United Nations — the\nthat’a going forward without benefit of news-\nPines. The guests on the two audition samples\nent -- straightforward and sincere and un-\nous.\nI think there’s a big need for this one, so it gets my\naffirmative vote.\n(2) \"Citizens at Work\" — NBC-Municipal League\nI like this even better than MThe People Act”, its ob¬\nvious predecessor. Well written, produced, and acted,\nand effective in getting the idea of citizen-action\nacross.\nOne of the sample tapes dealt with Greenwich, Conn.,\na town I happen to know well. The description of the\noverall spirit and flavor of the town was right on the\nbutton, and so was the statement of the town’s political\nproblem, so I’m sure these are thoroughly documented.\nLiked also the touches of humor and human interest. I\nthink this is a top-drawer series."
