Perhaps with this as a background,\nsome of the fertile minds in this room and else¬\nwhere in education and broadcasting, can refine\nand improve my suggestions in order to bring the\nmost urgent necessity of our times into being\nmore quickly.\nTo get educational television off the ground,\non a national scale, will require a massive injec¬\ntion of money, in the area of two-and-a-half bil¬\nlion dollars. It would be one of the most prudent\ninvestments we, as a nation, could make, because\nit would offer our best hope—and surely our\nmost realistic one—for achieving a substantial up¬\ngrading of educational quality on a short-run\nbasis and at a cost we could afford.\nThis $21/2 billion investment would buy:\nAnother 150 ETV stations giving us a nation¬\nwide educational network comparable to our\nnation-wide commercial networks. Approxi¬\nmate cost: $100 million.\nBranching closed-circuit systems for all schools\nin the United States. Approximate cost: $900\nmillion.\nStudios and television tape centers for origi¬\nnating programs for these closed-circuit sys¬\ntems. Approximate cost: $900 million.\nTelevision receivers for our million-and-a-quar-\nter classrooms. Approximate cost: $600 mil¬\nlion.\n3"
