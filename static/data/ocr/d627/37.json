Tettemer\nChairman\nStation KTCA-TV\nTelevision Sub-committee\nNAEB Utilisation Committee\nSt. Paul 8, Minnesota\nDear Clairt\nHave discussed with Harxy your \"thoughts* about going to Cincinnati to\ntalk to Lee Campion and Jim McPherson. Wte think it might be sell for\nyou to go, if you can arrange to do so.\nHarry will be down there for two or three of the days of the PAVI convention.\nHe*11 get in there the evening of March 1 and will likely leave the afterÂ¬\nnoon of March 3. That first evening (the 1st) is when he is apt to have\nthe most free time, in case you want to conifer with him.\nThere has been some exchange of information and some discussion about\ninvolving NAEB and DAVI in some co-operative efforts, but nothing firm\nhas been established. Therefore, I think it would be well for you to\ngo in there with an open mind and just see what they have to say. It\nis possible that McPherson may favor just a joint effort, too.\nThe letter you sent out looks good. Now, if you can work out something\nfor a project to McPherson*s satisfaction, we*ll be moving right along.\nHope you hear so on from some of the Chicago administrators, but I suspect\nthat It will be okay to proceed on the b$.s of Liz*s assurance. I expect\ntbs? main thing she wanted was merely to have the letter written, as a\n\"protection\" device, and you*ve done that.\nThanks for keeping us so well posted, and good luck with your meeting\nwith McPherson.\nCordially,\nHEH/kh\nHarold E, Hill\nAdministrative Vice President"
