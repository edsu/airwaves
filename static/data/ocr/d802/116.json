I think there are probably a few (Mr. Stevens\nfor sure) who would do the cause of acceptance of\nmodem poetry more arm than good.\nBert and I vote *YSS\" for Frost and MacLeish, and\nprobably most of the series. But only if we can,\nwithout diplomatic repercussions, eliminate the\nsuper-esoteric representatives."
