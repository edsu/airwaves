More elab¬\norate publication or printing would mean somewhat more.\nThe network suggestion I made to Bob would, of course, run to a good\ndeal more. I won’t go into that unless you think you’d be interested.\nOMs, I fear, may have confused the issue at the outset, in an effort\nto see what terms you were thinking in*\nIf you’d be interested in the Research Orant-in-Aid project, we’d\nbe delighted to go into tills further with you.\nI guess you know we were proud to have been able to help get funds\nto get S.FF& started, and to support them a hit in years when they\nwere more pressed and we were less so* Our interest in their kind\nof broadcasting, and your generaous support of them with your gift\nof WBAI, should indicate our common interest. We’ve felt pretty\nlonely in past years, asking that radio not be forgotten.\nSincerely,\nBarry J. Skornia\nPresident\nHJSljp\nBLCC: Dr. Sam Becker\nMr. Robert Lewie Shayon\nMr. William Harley\nMr. Richard Hull"
