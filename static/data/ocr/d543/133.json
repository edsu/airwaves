The more I think of all the work\nthe Board will have to do, and the fact that Convention starts Tuesday, with\nfirst business session at 2:00, the less I like being squeezed too much.\nEach year, so far, I (and often the whole Board) have been unable to be with\n\"our people\" in early stages of our own Convention — and I don*t think that«s\ntoo good. We changed Board times, because of Center meetings, at St. Louis,\ntoo. Does it always have to be the HAEB which moves? If we*ie so far committed\nwe can*t change, of course, 1*11 understand."
