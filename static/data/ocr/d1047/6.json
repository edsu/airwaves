I'll be glad to serve on\nthe Board...subject only to the absence of travel\nfunds to make possible travel at University expense.\nI hope that won't be an obstacle.\nRe: Arno Huth.. I had thought of his knowledge of\nAfrica and other places...and had planned to do essenÂ¬\ntially what you have done...Would it be possible to\nretain him as a general consultant, as well, for a small\nsum per year? I also intended to see if what we got would\nmake something like this poasible..Since his name as\none of our advisors would, I know, command considerable\nrespect..\nGlad you got to meet the Shinkmans. Hope something\nmaterializes there.\nFinally, guess Hill gets to be in Washington for a\nsnow-storm...Hope all of Jrou are not too paralyzed...\nOh, yes..In your letter, you say that Pearl and the\ngang send regards.. I know a Jewell, for instance, and\na Cam (ee-yoh?)...but a Pearl? Unmystify me..\nRega\nHarry Sk"
