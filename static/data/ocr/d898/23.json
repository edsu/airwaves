Blasi, Chairman\nEssex County Cultural & Heritage Commission\nHall of Records - Room 558\nNewark^,New Jersey 07102\nDear Mrs, Blasi:\nBy copy of his March 17 letter to you, CPB\nPresident John Macy indicated that I would\nforward appropriate information to New Jersey\nETV and radio stations concerning the Cultural\nand Heritage Commission established in your\nstate.\nIn discussing this with a member of the\nCorporation staff, it was felt that it might\nbe more appropriate for this office to supply\nyou with a listing of the New Jersey ETV and\nradio stations thus permitting you to make\nyour own distribution of materials-of to\ndevelop whatever contact you wish.\nI would suppose that a Cultural and Heritage\nCommission for each county in New Jersey would\nwant to work with educational broadcasting\nstations in the development of public service\nspot announcements and programs. Certainly,\nthe stations could be utilized to publicize\nthat activation of the commissions and to\nreport to the public their accomplishments and\nplans.\nI would imagine that s^rne of the commissions\nmight want to develop programs or series\nrelated to the stateâ€™s cultural growth and\ndevelopment as well as its great historical\nheritage. Educational stations should be\ninterested in carrying such programs if they\nare professionally produced.\nThere are no ETVsstations licensed in New Jersey\nbut the list of educational radio stations is\nattached.\nVery truly yours,\nRobert A. Mott\nEnel."
