  "text": "March 20, 1956\nMr. Gordon Campbell, Director\nProvince of Saskatchewan\nDepartment of Education\nAdult Education Division\n1100 Broad Street\nRegina, Saskatchewan\nDear Mr. Campbell:\nProfessor Leo Martin, our national president, has forwarded to me\nyour letter of March 2 requesting information on memberships for nine\nindividuals plus a menfcership for the Adult Education Division.\nThe Association for Education by Radio-Television does not have a\nplan for memberships on a group basis. I suggest that the best resolu¬\ntion of the menfcership situation which you cite is the following. You\ncan take out one institutional membership for the Adult Education Div¬\nision which entitles you to receive three copies of each issue of the\nJournal. You, in your capacity as director of the Division, plus any\nother members of your staff, would be covered by the institutional\nmenfcership. Then, in addition you can take out individual memberships\nfor each of the nine members of your television committee. These\nindividual memberships cover one copy of each issue of the Journal,\nplus the privileges of attendance at the AERT national convention, of\nvoting in elections for national officers and directors, participating\nin consnittee work, and participating in the exchange of ideas, research,\nmethods, and materials. I might add that these same general privileges\nare attached to the institutional menfcership. Generally, our institu¬\ntional members cite one person to serve as their representative.\nThe rate of the institutional membership is $15.00 annually, and\ntiie fee for individual r embers is $5.00 annually. I am enclosing a copy\nof our membership blank which contains a statement of the objectives of\nthe Association.\n(Continued)"
