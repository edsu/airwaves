We are communicating with the wrong media.\nVie must use the mass media not only to provide motivation through visual\nand aural action rather than through non-meaningful (to that child) print\nsymbols~~but we must use the mass media to provide a socializing situation\nfor the child, to make the real world a part of the classroom, to provide the\nproblems of the real world as the learning problems; the solutions learned--\nor at least the understanding obtained-~is what constitutes education.\nA comment by Marshall MacLuhan is appropriate here: \"All the young are\nin the same position . * . . The discrepency -between the riches of the TV\nfeast and the poverty of the school experience is creating great ferment,\nfriction and psychic violence . . . but the new era and the new violence does\nnot have an end in view ... it is the process itself that yields the new\nimage. When children go to school they are filled with rage at the puny\ncurriculum . . . the children in Watts ‘were quite right in thinking 'Why\nshould we go to school to interrupt our education?*\"\nPertinent to our discussion here today are the words of President\nJohnson on November 7, 1.967, when he signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967,\nThe President stated that \"while we work every day to produce new goods and to\ncreate new wealth, we want most of all to enrich man's spirit .... Today we\nrededicate a part of the airwaves--which belong to all the people-»for the\nenlightment of all the people .... We must consider new ways to build a\ngreat network for knowledge--not just a broadcast system, but one that employs\nevery means of sending and of storing information that the individual can use."
