It appears to me to be a wholly\nnegative statement. While I realize that you\nwant these people to pay tip or get out, I\nstill feel that the immediate reaction would\nbe to say \"to hell with itlw\nTherefore, stiggest a substitute letter, similar\nto the suggested one attached, which still\ncontains the same statement about cancellation of\nmembership within thirty days, but also suggests\nthat the individual might be missing something\nif he werenft to remit but fast.\nf'J J\nOm"
