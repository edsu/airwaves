This Committee should then:\n1. Draw up a national plan for the comprehensive development\n• of educational television.\n2. Prepare detailed budget proposals for large-scale public\nand private financing.\n3. Establish general timetables for the build-up of open-circuit\nand closed-circuit systems, plus tape-and-film libraries.\n4. Seek to enlist the wholehearted support of the Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare, the Foundations, and other interested\nprincipals.\n5. Mount a massive informational campaign to persuade every\nAmerican that failure to support this effort will mean the forfeiture of our\nchildren’s educational heritage.\nOurs is a task of formidable proportions. It can be accomplished\nonly if we pursue it with energy, intelligence and dedication. We must, all\nof us, keep pushing buttons everywhere — and keep responding when our\nown buttons are pushed. Thank you.\nO"
