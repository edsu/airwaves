John’s paper covered a\ndescription of the equipment and the facilities used\nat Hagerstown.\nWhile in Philadelphia we had the opportunity of\nvisiting the studios of WHYY-TV and being con¬\nducted on a tour of their new facilities by Samuel\nBarbour, Chief Engineer. He reports that present\nprogramming from 9:00 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. is primarily\nfor in school use. Programming will be expanded later\nto include evening hours. Reports of excellent re¬\nception on Channel 35 are very encouraging, Mr.\nBarbour states. WHYY-TV has a 12% KW RCA\ntransmitter with an ERP of 155 KW from a 500 foot\ntower.\n* * * * *\nA television film camera for $89.50! That’s what\nMerlyn Rawson paid for a surplus iconoscope camera\nwhich he has modified for use at the University of\nSouthern California Telecommunications studio at\nLos Angeles. While the definition can hardly be cal¬\nled broadcast quality, (about 250 lines) this ike chain\nenables them to integrate film and slides with live pic¬\ntures from the vidicon cameras used in teaching TV\nproduction.\nThe unmodified' camera has free running oscillators\nand internal sync such that the video signal is suitable\nfor feeding a monitor. However, the modification\nnecessary to use standard RETMA pulses is very\nsimple. A type 1846 iconoscope tube is used as the\npick up tube. Since this is not available from stock,\na spare camera tube was provided by purchasing a\nsecond camera. By the use of a simple mirror multi¬\nplexer, pictures from either a slide or film projector\ncan be projected directly on the mosaic of the icono¬\nscope.\nThe camera filaments operate from a 28 volt dc\nsupply although instruction sheets furnished with\nthe camera provide for AC operation by filament and\nplate rectifiers. A plate voltage of 400 volts at 175\nmils is required as well as 50 volts of bias. This\ncamera was built by RCA for aircraft use. We can\ntell you where it may be obtained on the West Coast\nalthough we’ve seen it advertised elsewhere. The data\nsheets mention this camera as belonging to the ATK\nor ATJ series although the heading is Television\nCamera CRV-59.\n*****\nA new list of available FM, and FM-AM combina¬\ntion receivers on the market has been compiled by\nRay Cheydleur of WFSU-FM at Florida State Uni¬\nversity. They are including the list in their fall pro¬\ngram bulletin recently released. With the thought\nthat other FM stations may want to include the list\nin their program bulletin or offer it to listeners, Ray\nhas supplied us with a number of copies of the list.\nWe’ll be glad to send it to you upon request.\n*****\n“Fundamentals of Light and Lighting,” Bulletin\nLD-2 of the General Electric Company, is an 86\npage text covering lighting terms, measurements,\ncolor systems and design fundamentals. Dick Lawson\nof the WILL-TV staff recommends it highly and\nuses it as a reference in his course work in TV pro¬\nduction. If you’d like a copy, write to the Inquiry\nBureau General Electric Co., Nela Park, Cleveland\n12, Ohio. They also have available a multilithed list\nof lamps for studio and theatre spotlights and flood¬\nlights. It covers lamps for virtually all of the units in\nuse in television studios. It might be helpful to our\nreaders in selection of proper lamp types for studio\nuse.\n*****\n“Operation Shoestring” a television project of the\nSchenectady Public Schools received considerable\nnotice in the trade press last summer. A letter from\nMr. Bernard F. Haake, Administrative Assistant, ex¬\nplaining the project, arrived too late to be included\nin the October Newsletter. Perhaps the point most\nemphasized last summer was that the system cost\nonly $3000.00.\nMr. Haake states that they did not intend to\nimply that a complex closed circuit television installa¬\ntion could be obtained at this price. The purpose of\nthe project was to place minimal equipment in the\nhands of teachers so that they could become ac¬\ncustomed to working with it. The teachers did use\nthe equipment, and now regard television in the same\nlight that they regard a tape recorder or movie pro¬\njector.\nThe equipment used a GPL vidicon camera and\nmonitor, which fed used television receivers purchased\nfor the project and installed in three rooms adjacent\nto the transmitting classroom. Speakers were bor¬\nrowed from film projectors to supply audio and room\nlighting was supplemented by photo floods in the\n“studio.”\nMr. Haake believes that many school systems\nwould be willing to spend $3000, as they did, to be¬\ncome familiar with this new medium and to see for\nthemselves that it has application and value to edu¬\ncation. Then they might be willing to consider more\nelaborate systems involving perhaps $40,000 to equip\na high school of 2000 students.\n*****\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year\nDECEMBER 1957\n5"
