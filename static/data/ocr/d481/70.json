You\nwere also kind enough to refrain from saying that the stickiness was In\nlarge parts, of my own making.\nI know, that you are deeply concerned about the future of the NAEB, and,\nas one who has the same depp-seated loyalties and emotional pre-dispo¬\nsitions, I can fully understand your feelings. I give you my pledge that\nI will not knov&ngly do anything to injure the NAEB or Impair its strength\nand growth. I do feel, however, that some of us “old-timers'* have\ndifficulty in seeing the organization in any other image than the one In\nwhich it was created. If the organization Is to be truly dynamic and strong,\nwe must be less concerned with keeping It as It wasyand more concerned\nwith allowing It to become as the Greeks say, \"What It has In It to be.\"\nIt was good to see you on the Board again, Carl, and I will look forward\nto our meeting in Columbus.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. H«rley\nPresident\nWGHrrkf\nP.S. The voucher for your expenses has been tramsitted to our bookkeeper\nin Urbana; you will be receiving a check shortly."
