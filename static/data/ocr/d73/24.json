Gifted students\nin small rural schools are taking college preparatory courses; classroom\ndemonstrations are being enriched by treasures from art, science and\nhistory museums; the abstractions of higher mathematics are being brought\nto a nation-wide audience of early-risers; students are completing as much\nas two years of college in their living rooms; parents are tuning in to follow\nthe daily lessons with their children.\nIt is also true that we have registered statistical progress. Our\n56 educational stations can reach 70 million people; 150 closed-circuit\nsystems operate in schools and colleges; 7, 500 schools use television\nfor regular instruction; 250 colleges and universities give academic credit\nfor televised courses; altogether, more than 4 million students receive\npart of their instruction by TV.\nThese figures indicate that we are out of the incubator -- but\nno more than that.\nEven after eight years, only 2 per cent of our students get\nany significant portion of their education from the picture tube. At the\npresent growth rate, educational TV will not be the primary instrument of\ninstruction until the year 2, 360 -- when our great, great, great grandchildren\nare enrolling in the first grade!"
