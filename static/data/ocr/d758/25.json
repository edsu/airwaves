  "text": "Minutes of NAEB Publications Committee Meeting Page 2\nOctober 30, 1957\nSchooley requested members of the Committee to procure other types\nof material, particularly articles on radio, book reviews, and a\nbibliography of materials in radio and TV for the past year,\nSulzer suggested that the Committee investigate the possibility of\nproviding for the membership a binder in which copies of the Journal\nmight be kept permanently. He thought that a price of about one\ndollar, with a possible additional charge of for imprinting the name\nof the Jour**al on the cover would meet with general approval.\nDunham described the type of spring binder used at the U.S. Office\nof Education, and offered to investigate manufacturers and secure\nestimates.\nThere was a brief discussion of policy in regard to Book Beviewers, and\nit was agreed that the names of suitable would be sent to\nFather Grady, who would assume the responsibility for keeping a\nfile of reviewers to whom books might be sent for review. Schooley\noffered to send a circular letter to the membership, requesting\nmembers to submit names of people they thought ready, able and\nwilling.\nSulzer opened the question of the style and content of the NAEB\nNewsletter. He expressed the opinion that it should be less chatty\nand personal, and more in the professional style of the NAEB8s\nown Engineering Newsletter, or the NARTB Newsletter, or even of\nTV Digest. After considerable discussion, it was found that there\nwas considerable agreement among the Committee members present, and\nSchooley was delegated to transmit the feeling of the Committee to\nthe Board of Directors.\nMeeting adjourned at 500 p.m."
