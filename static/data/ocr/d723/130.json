The Network distributes\napproximately eight hours of programming, by tape recording, weekly, to members\nsubscribing to its service. This fee is also based on power (with the same power\nclassifications as membership) and a new station does not have to pay the full fee\nuntil the third year it is in the Network. The fees are*\n3BL3BfiE\n$800.00\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\n500.00\n300.00\n375.00\n225.00\n250.00\n150.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from Network\nHeadquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A station paying its\nfull third-year rate is paying only a little over $2.00 an hour for better than\n/tpn hours of programming from the Network in a year. This is about the most\ninexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you have further\nquestions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHjdfc\nEnclosures"
