I certainly don't intend to let this drop merely because\nthe Center has made an offer to provide duplicating facilities for\nsuch a service. There will be a lot of stations coming on the\nair (like WNYC-TV not affiliated with the Center) and, of course,\na lot of closed-circuit operations will have an interest in such\nmaterials. Will keep you au courant.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH/mlg"
