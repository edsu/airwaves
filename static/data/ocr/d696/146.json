Marion Corwell kindly-\nconsented to supply me with the minutes of the session, and\nwhen she does, I will see that you get a copy pronptly.\nAmong the things we took up was a matter of seeking a grant\nto establish a PR position with NAEB. Lou Peneguy was asked\nto make that his chore and go into the matter. As you can see\nfrom the thermofax of his letter to me of October 30th, Lou\nis on the ball and is already making mental plans. However,\nsince this is a matter that might conflict with some of your\nthinking, I temporarily put the brakes on Lou, as you will\nnote from my attached letter. Both Lou and I will be glad to\nget your comments so Lou will know how to proceed.\nWhen you reply, please give us your ideas regarding the ques¬\ntions raised by Lou in his letter to me.\nI sincerely hope that you are feeling better. I believe that\nyou and your staff are entitled to great credit for one of the\nfinest conventions we have ever had, and I hope that all of\nyou are now getting a well-deserved rest.\nElmer G. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGSjvz\ncc: Miss Marion Corwell\nMr. Lou Peneguy"
