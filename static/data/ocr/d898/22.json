I have\ngiven no indication to anyone that we've met or\ntalked in recent days but Swezey seemed more\naware of our actions than I’d prefer. How\nshould I play it?\nReal reason for writing: I'm told that you have\ngood rapport with Mrs. Armstrong of the PM\nArmstrongs. Recently she gave $10,000 to NAFMB-\nand that gives me an idea. Especially since NAFMB\nnow spys that they should disband and be absorbed\nby 1 regular' NAB.\nIf we pulled a proposal togfefcher, could you lead\nus to a point of discussion—presentation-\ngrant with Mrs. Armstrong?\nSincerely,\nRAM/cb\nRobert A. Mott\nExecutive Director, NER"
