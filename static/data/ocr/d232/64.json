This cooperative assistance continued and increased with the\nexpanded activity of the Tape Network. Last year with the creation\nof the radio programs production grant at the Lowell Institute from\nthe Fund for Adult Education, one of the program elements in which Fund\nofficials expressed most interest was the area of international under¬\nstanding o\nAccordingly, pl.ans were made not only for the forthcoming series of\nprograms on USSR (People Under Communism) which by the way is to be re¬\nleased September 14th at tine same time as the Jefferson Heritage, but\nseveral other projects were planned and put in motion.

Plans for the international exchange of programs have been\ncarried forward and some of these programs will emerge in late fall for\nthe tape netvaork."
