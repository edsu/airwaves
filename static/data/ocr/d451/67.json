We are doing a\nrough draft....then a finished script...then a rough draft..then a\nfinished script, etc. Under this arrangement, the rough drafts won’t\nbe completed until almost the same time the finished scripts are com¬\npleted. All of which would be immaterial if I were John D. Rockefeller.\nBut I am Chub Benjamin,..in need of cash.\nTherefore.,.the model, indicating that somewhere between the\nfirst and the middle of August (because of interruptions in writing\nbrought about by measles, travel, production chores, preparation of\noutline, etc.) I shall probably have finished three rough drafts\nand three finished scripts.involving more tim.e and effort than\nsix rough drafts.\nAs of now, I have completed two rough drafts and two finished\nshooting scripts.which constitute two-sixths or one-third of\none-third and two-sixths or one-third of another one-third,, ..and\nsome of the kit^materials for these films.
