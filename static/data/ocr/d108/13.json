I can give\nyou, at that time,professional and character\nreferences, as well as financial security assurances,\nwhich I think ought to be considered somewhere along\nthe line.\nYou see, Mr. Holt, I am quite concerned about\nREPORT in EUROPE and want very much to have it\nsucceed and to measure up to highest expectations.\nTo this end, I am willing to bend every effort and\nalso to put in whatever financial contribution is\nnecessary: I do not regard it primarily as a 26\nshow affair. This number is arbitrarily arrived\nat for convenience sake; and, I think, too, that\nNAEB*s sponsorship for one year ought to be a\nmutually safe testing period; that is, I shall\ndeliver 26 tapes or more within a 12 month period.\nThis figure can very well and easily be made nearer\n40.\nI should welcome your opinion on this, and\nalso will ask you to hold up final judgment until\nyou have another tape of the Trieste program as\nwell as the new Finland show.\nCordially yours,\n/ yJbtjn H Lerch"
