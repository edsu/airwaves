Harley\nPresident\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nDuPont Circle Office Building\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Mr, Harley:\nLes Martin, Jr., WNED-TV General Manager, has asked me\nto answer for him your memorandum of May 25, 19^2 regarding\nexperimental TV production by NAEB.\nWe feel very strongly that the action taken by the\nBoard of Directors was somewhat arbitrary and bypassed those\nmost concerned—the ETV stations themselves—some of whom\nmay have reservations or questions concerning the proposal.\nIt is for this reason that the Region I ETV station managers\nmet recently and requested our regional director, Hartford Gunn,\nto write to you stating our case. I believe his letter fairly\nexpresses our feelings in the matter.\nWe are a relatively new member of NAEB and had been led\nto believe that the Association operated democratically, and\nthat major policy changes were made by the membership. We\nwere disillusioned by the manner in which the suggestions of\nMr. Gunn and Mr. Stone regarding the polling of ETV stations\nwere rather summarily dismissed.\nWe feel this is quite a change in direction for NAEB,\nand as such should be brought to a vote of the members.\nMAY is 11952\nNEW YORK STATE’S first EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION STATION"
