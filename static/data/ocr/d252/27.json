From such centers as\nMoscow, Peiping, Pyongyang, and Vladivostok, regular and\nfrequent radio programs are beamed to the Japanese, Until\nlate last year, the Communists operated a station, ironically\ncalled “Radio Free Japan11 devoted entirely to Japan and broad-\ncasting from Red China. Commercial trading companies,\ndealing almost exclusively in material from the Communist\norbit, import large quantities of reading matter that is\nsold for ridiculously low prices. It is often possible to\npurchase a dozen high quality Communist magazines for the\nprice of one popular American magazine. In addition to the\nSoviet Union and Red China, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,\nPoland, Bulgaria, North Korea, and strangely enough, the\nCommunist Party of the United States have provided material\navailable to Tokyo’s millions and, :n considerably lesser\namounts, throughout the country. The secret of the Communist\ntactic would appear to be their close cooperation with and\nreliance upon local groups who do the actual spreading of\nthe material to the public.\nThere are, of course, anti-Communist publications, including\nstrong and influential dailies such as the “Tokyo Shimbun,”\nIn spite of their ingenuity .and industry, the Communists have\nnot gained the suppbrt thatmignfbe expected from their\nactivities.\nIn the final analysis, it must be remembered that Japan has\nthe most well informed, intelligent population in all of\nAsia. They are not likely to be led astray easily. They\nwill make final decisions themselves.\n( 7 )"
