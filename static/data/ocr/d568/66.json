A regular program of workshops, seminars, fellowships*\nscholarships, internships, staff and personnel-exchange, and\nexchange of persons and programs with foreign broadcasting systems.\ne„ Emphasis on research, evaluation and impact-study to\ninsure that the broadcast media shall, as much as possible,\nserve the best, most significant interests and needs of mankind\nin a changing world 0\n* A A\nN01E TO ALL OFFICERS; This is offered for your reaction only, I prob¬\nably have forgotten something. But 1“ve tried to combine, sharpen and\nsimplify earlier statements. Done, like everything else, in haste, so\nI know style could be improved. I hope we can get such a statement\napproved in time to go in to Kellogg, and to use at various upcoming\nmeetings. Please react, with copy to Ausmus (and all other officers\nif you believe desirable), I m not trying to seise the initiative or\nfoist off my ideas. Please 'consider only as an honest effort on my\npart to help clarify this area,\nI expect this still needs about one more \"beating out\" to\neliminate the rest of the many repetitions there were in our earlier\nstatements.\nIn haste, with thanks,"
