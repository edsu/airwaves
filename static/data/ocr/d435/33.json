I just talked\nto him on the telephone re the enclosed letter.\nI have advised him on AFRA but I ducked out\nof taking a position on AFM until I could clear\nwith you. Is there any objection to ray discussing\nthis matter with Petrillo? I saw him the other\nday when he was here for last week* s meetings.\nI will be seeing him at the Convention in SeptemÂ¬\nber.\nPlease let me know if you think it is O.K.\nto follow through on it.\nMSNsck\ncc: H.
