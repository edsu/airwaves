This belief is strengthened,\nobviously, by President Johnson’s Educational\nMessage and the introduction of the Public Tele-\nvision Act of 1 Ml by Senator Magnuson in the\nSenate last\"witifiST For the first time, educational\nradio is a part of the package!\nAs you know, HER is in the final stages of completing\na major research project on the needs and status of\neducational radio in the United States. This pro¬\nject will result in a Report, perhaps as compre¬\nhensive in its own way as the Carnegie Report was\nfor ETV. It will serve as the basis for documenting\neducational radio’s case before Congress. While\nthe definite hearing dates have not been set yet,\nthe latest grapevine suggests that it could happen\nin a number of weeks.\nIn short, I need help—I need your help—and I need\nit as soon as possible. In a moment of weakness, you\noffered to help me in this crucial undertaking in\nany appropriate way. Since I believe you implicitly,\nI respectfully request the pleasure of your company\nat the nA£B headquarters in Washington for as many\nhours and days you can find (hopefully in the next\nweek or two) to aid in the analysis of material as\nit relates particularly to the Eastern states."
