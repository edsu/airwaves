On January 26,\nsame went to the printer. On February 14, we\nobtained 6 proofs from Mills (who had had to go\noutside their own shop to obtain the special\ntype ordered by the ad agency). Dutifully the 6\nproofs (as demanded by said agency) went off to\nNew York....with a letter asking for their re¬\nturn by February 24. (Forgot to say the proofs\nwent to New York on February 14, the day we got\nthem from Mills.)\nOn February 23, we received from the ad agency\na proof asking for many changes—which involved\nresetting five lines of type. Some of this was\nmisunderstanding of what was wanted in the first\nplace—but some of it was that the agency changed\nits mind on type. We had the type reset, as the\nagency wanted (with Mills having, once again, to\ngo outside their shop to get the exact type). On\nMarch 7, we sent via air mail 6 proofs of the\nrevised version, asking them to return one copy"
