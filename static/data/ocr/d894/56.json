Hull, Pres.,\nWOI, Iowa State College\nAmes, Iowa\nDear Dick:\nI am glad to know that NAEB is making\nAN APPEARANCE BEFORE THE FCC IN THE nMAYFLOWERtt\nhearing. Personally, I hope NAEB can agree with\nTHE NAB POINT OF VIEW AT THE HEARING. lT*S THE\nMATTER OF PRINCIPLE INVOLVED, BUT IF IT COINCIDES\nWITH THE NAB VIEWPOINT, FINE. Si EBERT HAS NO\nOFFICIAL CONNECTION WITH NAB, BUT IS FREQUENTLY\nCONSULTED BY THE BOYS IN THAT GROUP.\nHowever, l think what should be said\nIN THIS HEARING IS PURE AND SIMPLE. EDITORIALÂ¬\nIZING ON THE AIR SHOULD BE PERMITTED.\nSincerely yours,\nFES:mw\nFrank E. Schooley\nAssiSTANT D|RECTOR"
