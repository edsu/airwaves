The Network stations pay an annual\nNetwork Assessment Fee which is levied in accordance with the individual station^\ntransmitter power * The Network Assessment Fee for the fiscal year 1953-54 (July 1\nto June 30) is as follows:\nGlass A (5 kw or more) $400\nGlass B (1 kv - 4.° kw) 250\nClass G (less than 1 kw) 150\nAt the current rat-©, a Class A stfticn (usually belonging to a large university,\ncollege, or school system) pays only $1*10 per hour of programing* This figure is\nmuch lower for smaller stations, of course. Either figure is considerably lower\nthan if the station attempted to do comparable programming with its own resources.\nFees proposed for the next three years appear in the table below* The gradual\nincrease is due to an over-all plan which will* it is hoped, make the Network self-\nsupporting at the end of 1956.\n1954-55\n1955-56\n#1956-57\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\n1600\n375\n275\n$P 00\n500\n300\n$1,000\n625\n375\nOne hour of programming during the year 1954-55 (at 7 hours per week) would\ncost a Class A station only $1.66. During 1956-57, one hour of programing (at\n7 hours per week) would cost the same station $2*75* Again,* this is stiJl con¬\nsiderably less than what it would cost the station itself to produce similar pro¬\ngrams, In future years,, it is highly unlikely that the Network distribution will\nonly be 7 hours per weak. As the output increases,,, it is hoped that the oust per\nprogram hour will be reduced.\nIn spit© of these obvious savings * many stations who previously took Network\nservice have dropped out. They say that the Network service has been invaluable\nto them; but because of very limited budgets, they are not able to pay the nominal\n*0n!y tentatively proposed, as fees which would, in the light of\nrising expenses, obviously need to be charged, revising earlier\nestimates for final rat© likely*"
