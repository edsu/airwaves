It’s REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT ALSO IN\nTHE AREA WE’RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. The NEGRO PARTI¬\nCIPATES IN THE AMERICAN CULTURE. He IS BOUND TO BE\nINFLUENCED 3Y -AMERICAN VALUES WITH REGARD TO ‘WHAT IS\nGOOD, WORTHWHILE, WORTH HAVING. aND OURS IS STILL A\nCULTURE THAT PLACES APPRECIABLE STRESS UPON VARIOUS\nMATERIAL THINGS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED WITH MONEY. But\nAT THE SAME TIME THE NEGRO IS BY VIRTUE OF H|S LOW\nINCOME, LOW EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AND BY VIRTUE OF OTHE\nTHINGS STILL, ESPECIALLY HANDICAPPED IN THE EFFORT T\nOBTAIN THE SO-CALLED \"gOOD THINGS OF LIFE1’ THROUGH\nLEGITIMATE CHANNELS.
