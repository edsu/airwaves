I learned from Mr. Ewing of The Ohio State’s\nWOSU that a similar tape series : Voices of Europe\nconducted by Milton Mayer had been handled through\nNAEB. I have now heard some of these and seen the\nannouncements for the t hrfcc series. There certainly\nis no duplication of effort or .even overlapping of\neffort, as far as I can see.\nI should appreciate very much having you\naudit the tape and give me your candid opinion. I\nwrote the script here, from information gathered\nfrom the New York Times, the Atlantic, and clippings\nfrom newspapers. My intention on this sample tape\nis to creat the feeling of hearing something on-the-\nspot from Europe.\nI should like to go to Salzburg after the\nfirst of the year; and I have a tentative lease on\nan office there now. You will see from the attached\ncurriculum vitae that I have spent some time in that\npart of the country and know the area well. My reasons\nfor operating in and around Salzburg are stated, but\nthese two predominate: it is strategic to all points of\ninterest; and it is cheap.\nI regret that the copy dubbed off is somewhat\nlow in volume at first, and that a hum has occurrred.\nAt any rate, I think you will have a more detailed\nnotion of what REPORT in EUROPE is about after listening;\nand if there is sufficient interest from your staff at\nNAEB I should be happy to drive over for a few days.to\nexplain and Outline the whole procedure in detail. I might\nadd that local reaction among broaacasters here has been\nf avorabIe."
