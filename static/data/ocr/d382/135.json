Nelson:\nPending consideration and action by the Foundation on the recent\nNAEB requests for funds to cover proposed activities In the use\nof radio and television for education during the next two years,\nthis is to request permission of the Foundation to use unexpended\nfunds in the next fiscal year.\nAs you know, the present grant was for a one-year period, and for\nspecific purposes. We have found it impossible to hold two of\nthe seminars before June 30. Too, we have some moral commitments to\nsome of our staff, as Or. Skornia pointed out in our recent discus¬\nsions.\nTherefore, may we have your authorization to expend unused balances\nafter July 1, in order to carry on the same work contemplated when\nthe grant was made?\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hull, Chairman\nFoundation Committee\n2480 North Starr Road\nColumbus 21, Ohio\nRBH/mh\ncc: Burton Paulu\nHenry Chadeayne\nHarry Skornia\nFrank Schooley\nJames H)les"
