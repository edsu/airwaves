  "text": "DRAFT\nAs President of the NAEB, I wrote in October 1965 to your Secretary-General\nto enquire about the possibility of rayJe^eeiastien becoming an associate\nmember of the ABU. At that time I said that the operational expenditure\nof all our members could not be exactly stated but might be in the vicinity\nof $US35,000,000. I also said then that we would find it difficult to\npay more than $US 500 per annum. You will understand that our members\ninclude many schools, colleges, universities and State Education Departments,\nmost of whose operations are run, in varying degrees, on a voluntary basis.\nI should explain that the figure quoted in 1965 included the cost of\nmaintaining educational programmes transmitted within educational institutions\nby mean of closed circuits and which, therefore, are not strictly\n\"broadcast‚Äù services. The tol&l also included a rough estimate of the\nvalue of services provided on a voluntary basis. If these two factors\nare excluded from your calculations, as we believe they should, the operational\nexpenditure of NAEB could be estimated at less than $25,000,000 and therefore\nwould place the NAEB in the category or group which, I understand, pay\n10 units of $100 each, an amount which the NAEB would be prepared to pay."
