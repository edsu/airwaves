C,\nDear Mr. Street:\nI discussed your letter of November 21st with the netwol sub¬\ncommittee on program planning on December 3 and was author, tod to\nwrite the following observations.\nW© think that the goals arid general ideas of your Centenntl are\nexcellent and all of could think of many ways in which the p: nciples\ncould be used in radio programs. I believe that the network Dds a\npowerful, revealing series on American education past and pre&nt, and\nthis Centennial may provide the springboard for such a series. :r®\nfurther feel that if a top notch plan could be well developed,\nfunds might be secured for the production costs.\nWe are not close enough, however, to the Centennial and to the\nwhole problem of education’s story to be able to envision what the.\nseries would contain. So we are calling on you for further detail*,\nthat you say you can provide. Please do not spend too much time on\nthis, since we are merely exploring at this point. But some of yo:r\nideas about series content, advisory specialists, production cente’S,\nand even formats vrould be most helpful to us.\nWhat do you think; can you provide us with some additional information\nso I can approach the network or other people with a more firm proposal?\nI appreciate your letter and hope to hear from you again soon.\nSincerely,\nKDW • ss\nKenneth D. Wright\nChairman, Sub-Committee on\nRadio Program Planning"
