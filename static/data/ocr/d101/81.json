C.\nDear Walter:\nOctober 8 and 9 are fine for me for the meeting\nof the field reader group. 1 could also make any of the\nother dates mentioned in your notice, though I would be\nhappier if October 10 was not among them.\nPlease tell Guy McGee that I received two packages\nof proposals. He was worried that 1 had not received\nthem because of some confusion about my address. I am\nat the State University of Iowa, not Iowa State University.\n(It was confusing enough when the latter was called College.\nIt is terrible now.)\nLooking forward to seeing you again next month.\nBest,\nSLB:mw\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
