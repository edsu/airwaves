In order to get Goggin and others help\npromptly, as you know, I*ve had preliminary discussions\nwith Morris Novik (see attached).\nHarry expressed the hope that w@*d check since\nthey also were going into this. My reaction was that this\nappeared to me to be a natural area for NAEB to cover (both\nradio and TV) for its member stations, and that we’d proceed.\nI*d like your authorization to have Morris go ahead , and we\nshall keep Newburn informed. 'We can reach modest agreement\nwith Novik if we get no funds9 be more generous if we do get\nfunds. But time is of the essence, and I should like to\nkeep NAEB claim to all such areas as positive and clear cut\nas possible.\nI suggest advisory committee take this up, as well\nas NAEB Board, or many of ©ur services are likely to be adopted.\nI can see Center interests in individual cases, but hope the\nstation union relations problem as such is seen as unequivocably\nours.\nFor Board Discussion in January.\n12-10-53"
