During that period, television has\nbecome a proven educational tool in the United States. The concept of using\nthis medium for the dissemination of information, knowledge, and training is\ncapturing the minds of responsible persons all over the world. It is mandatory\nthat ICA policy be consistent with the presently known facts.\nThe facts are clear. There is ample research and experimentation to\nindicate that television is a useful ingredient in the education and training\nof both in-school and out-of-school groups.\nFrom the broad point of view, ICA should establish a research and\ndevelopment program inâ€™ communications to facilitate the movement of knowledge\nregardless of the present intellectual growth of the recipients. Such a\nprogram would include television materials.\nSpecifically, in regard to television, ICA policy should provide\nfor the following;\n1. Feasibility studies concerned with the establishment of television\nfacilities.\n2. The establishment of closed circuit, or low power open circuit,\ntelevision facilities in educational institutions or groups\nof institutions.\n3. Where television broadcast stations exist, assistance in the\nestablishment of an agency capable of using the facilities for\neducational purposes.\n4. Participant training for television personnel.\n5. The exploration and possible establishment of receiver assembly\nplants, and the provision of receivers for educational and\ntraining purposes.\n6. Assistance in the establishment of large stations and national\ntelevision systems where circumstances warrant.\n7. Review of television policy on a regular basis to insure that\nICA thinking is in harmony with worldwide developments.\n-w"
