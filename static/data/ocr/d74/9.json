February 15> 1961â€”Just what does education need in the\nway of television channels, now and in the future? This is the question the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters hopes to answer in a project it\nhas undertaken with the U. S. Office of Education. The contract under Title VII\nof the National Defense Education Act was signed this week.\nThe survey has the blessing of the Federal Communications Commission, which\nhas announced as its No. 1 problem that of proper allocation of TV spectrum\nspace. Without specific evidence as to how much space educational groups will\nneed, the FCC has indicated that education might be seriously slighted in any\nredesign of the TV allocation system.\nIn announcing the contract, NAEB President William G. Harley said, \"The FCC\nis under constant pressure for channel space in a spectrum already crowded, and\npressure can be expected to increase. We are hopeful that this project will\nresult in specific documentation of education^ needs.\"\n(more)"
