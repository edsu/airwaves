lede: Whether in women’s history or in sound studies, preserving audio,
  especially the voices of housewives, has rarely been prioritized. To tell the
  story of women’s lives in twentieth-century America as told on radio, for
  example, history can’t be written only from what is found, but by stringing
  together pieces of audio and archived documents that together tell a more
  complete story. The Broadcast A/V project offers opportunities across four
  non-commercial media collections to piece together how rural women were
  imagined and addressed by educational radio throughout the twentieth century

**Background**

One of the hardest lessons to learn when conducting historical research is that the artifacts you find are only a part of the story you need to tell. We learn critical information from exploring the alleyways, the side streets, and the dead ends of archival research and probing the gaps in the historical record. When assembling a narrative, we must look at objects both lost and found, erased and recovered, to assemble a more truthful account of the past. This methodological perspective is particularly important when studying the historical relationship between marginalized groups and the media. Whether in women’s history or in sound studies, preserving audio, especially the voices of housewives, has rarely been prioritized. To tell the story of women’s lives in twentieth-century America as told on radio, for example, history can’t be written only from what is found, but by stringing together pieces of audio and archived documents that together tell a more complete story.
