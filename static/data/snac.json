    "description": "<biogHist><p>Chalmers Marquis, a longtime lobbyist for educational television, attended the University of Chicago College before moving on to the University of Illinois, where he trained in journalism and broadcasting and studied under Frank Schooley . While at the University, Marquis created a campus radio station that broadcast from a photography store in Urbana. Upon completion of his courses in 1950, Marquis accepted a job as a \"dolly-pusher\" at WGN TV, where he remained for three years. He then took a position at WBBM TV, the CBS affiliate in Chicago. There, he produced and directed numerous commercials in addition to his work with regular programming.</p><p>Marquis's desire to see television used as an instrument of learning rather than merely passive entertainment prompted his acceptance in 1955 of a position with WTTW, Chicago's public television station. First working as a producer/director, Marquis soon moved into the realm of public relations and development, and eventually became director of programming. He remained with WTTW for nine years, during which time the station was the largest public broadcaster in the United States, setting the standard for educational broadcasting.</p><p>Despite various obstacles, such as a lack of funding and a kilowatt signal approximately one quarter as powerful as those of commercial stations, Marquis fostered the genesis of numerous projects and expanded WTTW. He organized Chicago Area School Television (CAST), which broadcasted two channels into local classrooms.</p><p>In 1965 Marquis became the first full-time executive director of Educational Television Stations (ETS, created in 1963), the newly-formed television arm of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) . He participated in the establishment of the Educational Television Stations Program Service (later the Public Television Library ), which supplied programming to public television stations. He was also involved in the movement to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) .</p><p>Due to the consistent lack of funding for public television stations, Marquis spent increasing amounts of time lobbying for government funding, particularly from administrative departments such as Health, Education, and Welfare. He fought to push through the House of Representatives legislation that eventually became the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 .</p><p>Marquis's work at ETS led to his position in 1970 as Executive Vice President of NAEB, which he followed with a term at the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Marquis then became a full-time lobbyist as legislative liaison for the National Association of Public Television Stations (NAPTS), which later became America's Association of Public Television, Inc. (APTV), a lobbying arm of the Association of America's Public Television Stations (APTS).</p><p>Along with his work for NAPTS, Marquis frequently lobbied Congress on behalf of the Children's Television Workshop . He spent much of his time gathering evidence, later presented to various congressional committees, demonstrating the positive impact of public broadcasting and the necessity for its continued existence. His work involved efforts to obtain funds from the National Science Foundation, to procure government funding for CTW programs such as 3-2-1 Contact, Square One TV, and Ghostwriter, and to further the development of the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television.</p><citation>From the guide to the Chalmers Marquis Papers, 1978-1993, and undated, 1985-1992, (Mass Media and Culture)</citation></biogHist><biogHist><p>Public broadcasting lobbyist.</p><p>Director of programming, WTTW (Chicago, IL) 1955-1964; Executive director, Educational Television Stations division, National Association of Educational Broadcasters, 1965-1970; Legislative liasion, National Association of Public Television Stations; Lobbyist on behalf of the Children's Television Workshop.</p><citation>From the description of Chalmers Marquis Papers, 1978-1993 and undated (University of Maryland Libraries).

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Born on January 10, 1910 in Lyon, the French conductor and composer, Jean Martinon entered the Lyon and Paris conservatoires to study the violin. At Lyon, his teacher was Maurice Foundray and at the Paris Conservatory, he studied violin technique with Jules Boucherit. While at the Paris conservatory, Martinon took composition with Albert Roussel and Vincent d'Indy. After completing the composition courses, he studied conducting with Charles Munch and Désormière. He graduated from the Paris Conservatory in 1928, winning a premier prix.</p><p>Martinon's familiarity with conducting started in France, followed by various appointments in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. In 1946, he embarked on a conducting career directing the Concerts du Conservatoire in Paris and the Bordeaux Symphony. The successful debut with the LPO led to his appointment as associate conductor of the orchestra in 1947. From 1947-1950 Martinon directed the Radio Eireann orchestra, Dublin and in 1951, he returned to Paris to conduct the Concerts Lamoureux until 1957. From 1957-1959, Martinon conducted the Israel Philharmonic. His appointment as the next conductor of the Düsseldorf Symphony occurred in 1959. Martinon was in Düsseldorf until 1963 when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra selected him as their music director, a position he held until 1968. During that same year, he returned to France to direct the French National Radio Orchestra and served as the principal conductor of the Hague Residentie–Orkest from 1974 until shortly before his death in 1976.</p><p>Martinon's extensive experience as a composer led to his approach to conducting. The Symphoniette pour orchestre á cordes, piano, harpe et timbales, op. 16, from 1935, is one of three first attempts at composition. After enlisting in the war, Martinon's imprisonment in a German camp, Stalag IX A, resulted in several new compositions, Psaume 136, le Chant des Captifs, Musique d'Exil, Sonatina No.3, Sonatina No. 4 for wind instruments, and various choral works. In 1946, the city of Paris awarded a prize to his composition le Chant des Captifs. After the war, other notable compositions include Symphonie no. 3 (Irlandaise), the Concerto no. 2 pour violin et orchestre, op. 5, dedicated to Szeryng, and the Concerto pour cello et orchestre, op. 52, composed for Pierre Fournier. For the stage Martinon composed two works, the ballet Ambohimanga ou la Cité Bleue and in 1949 the opera Hécube with a libretto by Serge Moreux. Symphony no.4 Altitudes was the outcome of a commission from the Chicago Symphony to commemorate its 75th anniversary.</p><p>Martinon had recently taken on a position at the Paris Conservatory to teach conducting when he died from a serious illness on March 1, 1976.</p><citation>From the guide to the Jean Martinon papers, 1923-1994, (Music Library)</citation></biogHist>",

Rockefeller, by act of the New York State Legislature, \"to promote the well-being of mankind throughout the world\". From its earliest years, several separate organizations and divisions have carried on the Foundation's work in carefully selected fields. In 1913, the International Health Board (originally the International Health Commission) was formed in order to extend the work of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradicationof Hookworm Disease. The following year, the China Medical Board was established as a division of the Foundation to develop modern western medicine in China; the Board ceased to be a division of the Foundation in 1927. In 1919, a formal Medical Education Division was established to carry outa program of medical education outside the United States. With the 1929 reorganization of the Foundation, the International Health Board was disbanded and an International Health Division was organized. The China Medical Board was established as a separately incorporated institution, and the China Medical Board of the Foundation ceased to exist. The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was combined with the Foundation and the Spelman Fund of New York was chartered to continue activities of the LSRM which were not absorbed by the Foundation.</p><p>The Foundation adopted a program which it largely continues today, which included public health work, the advancement of knowledge in the medical and natural sciences, the social sciences, and the arts and humanities.</p><citation>From the description of Rockefeller Foundation Archives,1910-(1912-1989).

    "description": "<biogHist><p>The American Literature Group was formed in 1921, after the Modern Language Association (MLA) reluctantly acknowledged a growing scholarly interest in the writing of the United States. At the time such literature was studied primarily in secondary schools, and most colleges and universities had no courses on the topic. Those that did, usually offered only a single survey course. The idea that American literature could stand on its own as a discipline was viewed with skepticism, it being understood at the time as a branch of the literature of England - a branch almost wholly lacking the greatness of its parent.</p><p>The members of the new group felt that in order to prove their subject reputable, they must bring it into line with the model of disciplines that had come into being in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. This model was based on the empiricism of the sciences, which had been modified in English as philology, author biography, textual history, and in its furthest speculative reach, influence study. Interpretive criticism was viewed as insufficiently scholarly, the domain of the \"amateurs\" who had dominated writing about American literature up to this point. Similarly, some in the Group thought that it should organize a way to better train secondary school teachers in the area, but this was rejected as insufficiently academic.</p><p>The Group met each December at the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association. Many of the early papers presented under the auspices of the Group dealt with the problem of how to build a proper discipline. Work was immediately begun on bibliographies and on lists of manuscript resources and dissertations written (or needed). In 1926, as an aid to research, the field was divided into three areas: the Puritan tradition, Romanticism in American literature, and the frontier spirit. In 1928, the Group's approach was documented by the essays in The Reinterpretation of American Literature (edited by Norman Forester), which added a fourth area, realism. Efforts to establish a quarterly journal that dealt exclusively with American literature began in 1924. Duke University eventually won a small bidding war for it, and the first issue of American Literature was dated March, 1929. In 1928 a full scheme of officers and procedures was put into place with the first version of the articles of organization. This document would be periodically revised over the following decades. One project that never got off the ground was a history of American literature. Almost from its inception, the Group was dissatisfied with the existing one - The Cambridge History of American Literature (1918) - because it was written prior to the discovery of much information, gave no relative weight to different figures and genres, and had no overarching vision of the area. A committee headed by Robert Speller worked toward a plan for a new history during the thirties, but conflicting positions concerning readiness and approach caused the plan to be abandoned by 1941. (Speller proceeded with the project outside of the Group, his work resulting in The Literary History of the United States (1948).)</p><p>After World War II, with American literature firmly in place as an academic area, the Group became less central to the discipline's development. The rise of American studies in the early 1950s prompted discussion and dispute concerning the difference between cultural-historical work, and more traditional emphases on literary excellence and the humanistic approach to literature (particularly in the classroom). Insurgent movements occasionally have arisen as the Group was felt to be behind the critical times. In 1968 younger members staged a protest at the annual meeting, agitating for a direct denouncement of the Vietnam War and more explicit politics in general (particularly regarding the college students whom the professors were serving). Meanwhile the Group (which became a full-fledged MLA Section in 1966) has periodically had to fight for particular kinds of recognition and privilege within its parent organization.</p><p>A full list of the Group's/Section's Chairs and Secretaries (later Executive Coordinators) is appended to this inventory and may be used as a cross-reference with the container lists to interpret the collection's coverage of various periods and figures. A fuller listing of officers from 1921-1948 is provided in Kermit Vanderbilt's book (cited below) on pages 545-548.</p><p>For more information on the American Literature Group/Section, see the following books, parts of which were written using the American Literature Section Papers: Kermit Vanderbilt, American Literature and the Academy(Philadelphia: U.

Plans for the new library were underway when the university's first President, William Rainey Harper, passed away in 1906. To honor his service to the university, it was decided that the new library would be dedicated to his memory. Construction began in 1910 when the first cornerstone was laid. The building was completed in June of 1912, when the first dedication ceremony took place. Harper Memorial Library served as the main library for the university until the Regestein Library opened in September of 1970. At this time, Harper Library and Wiebolt Hall (originally constructed in 1928) were renovated to preserve their unique architecture and make them better able to meet the university's growing needs. The rededication ceremony in 1973 marked the completion of these renovations and the transformation of the Harper Memorial Library from the university's main library to the new College Center, designed to be the distinctive home for the undergraduate College.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

From its initial concept, presented in 1924 by President Burton, the residential hall has had a core aim to create a community within the larger University. The neo-Gothic building south of the Midway is comprised of six houses: Dodd-Mead, Chamberlin, Vincent, Coulter, Linn-Mathews, and Salisbury.</p><p>Jonathan Fanton was Resident Master of Burton-Judson Courts from 1978 to 1982. Under Fanton's efforts, the Faculty Fellows program of the residence hall took form. Fanton invited faculty members to become involved in the social events of the residence hall, attend special dinners in their honor with small groups of students, and provide personalized mentorship to incoming freshman residents. Fanton also led the organization of a momentous fiftieth anniversary celebration of the residence hall in November 1981.</p><p>Harold and Marlene Richman led Burton-Judson Courts from 1982 to 1992 as Resident Masters. They inherited Fanton's burgeoning Faculty Fellows program and built its ongoing, yearly success. Under the Richmans, a wide variety of resident activities and quarterly events flourished, including Cabaret Nights, the B-J Olympics, and the B-J Players' yearly musical theater productions. The B-J newsletter, Courtside, was started in 1984 and sent to the Faculty Fellows, among others, to keep them informed of the many events occurring in their adoptive residence hall.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

Lecture-Study Department speakers went on tours throughout the Midwest to present evening and weekend courses. The Class-Study Department provided off-campus instruction in the city, offering courses similar to those available on campus; in the early years of the twentieth century, Class-Study began giving courses in subject areas requested by specific groups of people. Basic and remedial courses by mail came under the jurisdiction of Correspondence-Study. By 1897 the other three units-Examination, Library, and Training-had been absorbed by the first three; a department devoted to Bible study had been dropped even more quickly. Not until 1905, when the American Institute of Sacred Literature merged with the Extension, was Bible study restored.</p><p>In 1900 the Extension faculty lost its separate and statutory existence. The Board of University Extension assumed governing responsibility until 1916, when the Extension's administration and governance reverted to its Director.</p><p>Especially during the first quarter-century of its existence, the Extension served teachers and aspiring teachers. In 1898, aided by a grant from Mrs. Emmons Blaine, the University organized the downtown College of Teachers. Two years later it merged with the Class-Study Department under the name University College. University College was conceived as \"an arrangement for selecting and conducting courses of study at a place and time convenient for those who cannot attend ordinary courses at the Quadrangles.\" By 1911 the Lecture-Study Department had also been incorporated into University College, and its circuit riding program was discontinued. The Correspondence-Study Department remained part of the Extension and in April 1924 was renamed the Home-Study Department.</p><p>Beginning in the 1920s, but particularly during the 1930s and 1940s, University College developed educational programs in cooperation with specific professional groups, among them the American Chemical Society and the American Institute of Meat Packers. Other specialized courses included those for mechanical and electrical engineers as well as for members of the printing and lithographic industries. During this same period University College expanded its services by tailoring courses to the needs of businessmen, civic leaders, and government administrators. Innovative offerings in the liberal arts, particularly the Great Books series and the Basic Program in Liberal Education for Adults, proved to be extremely popular. Capitalizing on the success Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler had with the Great Books courses, the Basic Program was a four-year liberal arts training program designed around group discussions and lectures on classical and modern literature. Other programs, such as the Institute of Statistics and the Institute of Public Service, survived only briefly in wartime conditions.</p><p>By the 1960s, University Extension enrollment had declined precipitously from the two previous decades. After 1963-64 the Home-Study Department ceased to exist, and the Downtown Center closed in 1974. By 1982 the University Extension had become part of the Center for Continuing Education. Though Its programs and course offerings have been reduced from earlier years, this entity continues to offer adult educational services, most of them non-credit, in the following areas: liberal education, including the Basic Program; business and professional courses, particularly in publishing, communications, and marketing; and higher education, including faculty symposia and seminars.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. University Extension. Records, 1892-1979, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>Primavera was a feminist literary magazine founded at the University of Chicago in 1975. It was conceived of by Janet Ruth Heller, Celia Josephson, and Deborah Gordon Fisher, and was proposed at the first meeting of the University of Chicago Feminist Organization. The intention was to give women an outlet for their creative work and also to counterbalance another campus publication, Wild Onions, which at the time published work mainly by men. The magazine had several unique attributes from its inception, particularly the invitation extended to all contributing authors and artists to sit on its editorial board, and the commitment to providing feedback for manuscripts that were not selected for publication. These practices could not be sustained for the life of the magazine, however, and by Issue 8 it was operating with a 6-person editorial board. In the mid-1980s the policy of returning all manuscripts with feedback was modified and authors given the option to request comments on their work.</p><p>Initially a student organization, the magazine received funding from the University, though that had to be supplemented by grants and loans to cover printing costs. In the 1980s Primavera began to have difficulty in continuing to secure University funding due to their women-only acceptance policy, though it remained affiliated with the University of Chicago until 1990. When the magazine went its own way, a nonprofit corporation was established (Moveable Type, Inc.), under whose auspices operations continued. It was around this time that Primavera began accepting submissions from men, though the focus remained on the lives and experiences of women.</p><p>Primavera came into being among many similar publications, among them Black Maria, Calyx, and Sing, Heavenly Muse! While these were all in some sense women's literary journals, they varied in focus. Primavera is notable for its lack of political content; very few essays were published, and the editorial focus was on the artistic merit of the pieces selected. The magazine was more concerned with reflecting the experiences of women than with encouraging activism or overt political messaging. The women reflected in its pages were often older than the demographic reflected by many feminist magazines, were more likely to come from the Midwest (or other areas besides the Northeast and West Coast, which were well represented in the mainstream feminist movement and its associated publications), and there was less of an emphasis on lesbian issues or experiences in Primavera than in some journals.</p><p>Issues for the feminist movement at large were also issues for Primavera. That Primavera was a Midwestern magazine placed it somewhat outside the (largely coastal) mainstream of the feminist movement. There was some initial difficulty in getting the magazine reviewed in Ms., which the editors may have felt had to do with the differing values, experiences, and needs of women in large coastal cities and women in the Midwest and south.</p><p>The magazine was the recipient of multiple Illinois Arts Council grants and literary awards, awards from Chicago Women in Publishing, and a Puffin Foundation grant used to translate poems by women from around the world. Notable authors who appeared in its pages include Louise Erdrich, 1997 Pulitzer Prize winner Lisel Mueller, Pamela Gemin, Michael Lee West, Diane Seuss, Lori Ostlund, and Chitra Divakaruni.</p><p>Members of Primavera's editorial board undertook other publishing-related work as well. In 1986 designer Lisa Grayson and editor Ruth Young worked on a side project preparing and publishing a booklet of early poems by Margaret Pearce Rummel, entitled The Other Side of the Hill. Grayson also work as a designer for other periodicals.</p><citation>From the guide to the Primavera. Records, 1975-2006, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>After the initial money-raising effort for $400,000 to complement John D. Rockefeller's gift of $600,000 (which was to establish \"a new institution of higher learning in the West\" under the auspices of the American Baptist Education Society), public solicitation of funds played a very small part in building up the endowment of the young University of Chicago. Wealthy subscribers, headed by Mr. Rockefeller, provided the major share of necessary funds. Prior to 1924, the only fund-drive involving mass contributions from alumni and friends was the Harper Memorial Library Fund (begun 1908) when $250,000 was raised to complement the sum of $750,000 pledged by Mr. Rockefeller [see President's Papers 1889-1925.</p><p>In 1924 when the University announced a public campaign to double its endowment, many people including alumni were genuinely surprised that this University, which had by President Harper's wishes opened its doors in 1892 as if long established, should have pressing financial needs. The public assumed that the University was under the perpetual patronage of the Rockefellers and various wealthy Chicagoans. In fact, the University itself had not made any significant attempt to cultivate giving among its alumni--who were, after all, not yet strong in numbers. The 1924-26 Development Campaign was thus the first major public as well as private fund drive.</p><p>In 1941, with the experience of the 1924-26 campaign behind it, the University initiated another major development campaign to coincide with its Fiftieth Anniversary celebration. This too was a new departure since previous anniversary celebrations (or celebrations of \"Founder's Day\" as they were first called) had not been explicitly connected with development. As originally conceived, the Fiftieth Anniversary Committee on Development was a group of trustees appointed to oversee the Anniversary plans. It was, however, the Executive Committee of the Committee on Development under the direction of the Executive Chairman (a trustee) which provided the coordinating core for the 1941 events; the other members of this committee included the President of the University, the Executive Director the directors of the Alumni Foundation, the Anniversary Celebration, Foundations, Publicity, the Citizen's Committee, and various other administrative and staff personnel.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

The competitions represented in this collection are mostly privately-endowed prizes, awarded by the university to University of Chicago students. A brief account of some of the more notable prizes follows.</p><p>The Academy of American Poets Prize was established in 1955 by the academy for students at colleges and universities across the country. Participating schools can set certain standards for the competition, though no restrictions on poetic format/form are allowed. The prize is still in existence, but the University of Chicago no longer participates.</p><p>The Chicago Folklore Prize originally honored any contribution to folklore studies – essay, monograph, collection of material etc. It was established in 1904 by the American Folklore Society. The prize is still awarded, now for book-length works.</p><p>The David Blair McLaughlin Prize is an internal University of Chicago prize. It honors critical or scholarly essays in English prose in a range of subjects. The prize is named in memory of David Blair McLaughlin, 1895-1914, a University of Chicago student who died tragically in a diving accident. His parents established the prize in 1914; the first competition took place in 1916, and the award was $50.</p><p>Beginning in 1895, a handful of prizes were offered annually for essays in economics, adjudicated by a committee of professors from various universities including the University of Chicago. The prizes were sponsored by three Chicagoans and the competition was open to undergraduates and others throughout the country.</p><p>The Fiske Poetry Prize was established in 1920 by Horace Spencer Fiske, in memory of his father John Billings Fiske. Open to University of Chicago students, it was judged annually by the chair of the English Department, a prominent American poet, and an American literary critic. The prize is no longer offered.</p><p>The Florence James Adams Prize, first awarded in 1912, was for excellence in artistic reading, generally of poetry.</p><p>The Gellhorn Prize in Neurophysiology was established in 1963 by Ernest Gellhorn, a neurophysiologist at the University of Minnesota. It was administered by the University of Chicago's Physiology Department.</p><p>The Olga and Paul Menn Foundation Prize was established in 1949 in accordance with the 1946 will of Olga Menn. Four yearly prizes were offered originally, for short stories, novels, or plays, to University students between the ages of 20 and 26. The first prizes were awarded in 1950. By 1956 musical compositions were also accepted. Currently, one prized is awarded annually, for plays only.</p><p>Another early prize was offered by the New England Free Trade League, for an essay on the topic of trade protectionism. Prizes were offered at five colleges, and awarded in 1899.</p><p>The Political Institutions Prize began in 1918 as the Civil Government Prize, but was renamed in 1944. It was awarded annually to an undergraduate on the basis of an essay on a political topic. It appears that the award later became the Goettler Political Institutions Prize, and that it is no longer awarded.</p><p>The Ronald S. Crane prize in criticism was named for the founder of the Chicago School of Literary Criticism.</p><p>The Sergel Drama Prize is awarded by the University, but open to playwrights of any age, from anywhere in the world. The prize is awarded biennially. It was established in 1934 by the widow of Charles H. Sergel, a publisher and politician with a particular interest in drama. Awards are presented to plays of different specified sorts in different years. Winning plays are produced at the University. Judges of the competition have included Thornton Wilder and Frank O'Hara.</p><p>The Snowday Prize, named for Ronald H.

Throughout World War I, the University offered the United States government use of its laboratories and many members of the of the Board of Trustees and the faculty engaged in a variety of war work outside the University.</p><p>Prior to the United State's official declaration of war, a Reserve Officer Training Corp was established and the Committee on Plans and Organization of Military Resources was created to prepare the University for wartime. The Committee was active during the onset of World War I, but as the war progressed, more specialized committees were created to fulfill the needs of the University. In time, ten committees were formed: Intelligence; Military Training; Medical Work and Training; Quartermaster and Ordinance Service Training; Publicity; Relief and Social Work; Woman's War Aid; and Women Student Activities.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

She received a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1963 and was awarded the Alumni Association Public Service Citation in 1981. A founding member of the Hyde Park Historical Society, Block also served on the boards of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Chicago Architecture Foundation and International House.</p><p>Block was a renowned expert on the architecture of the University and its surrounding neighborhood. Her 1978 book, Hyde Park Houses: An Informal History, 1856-1910, describes the neighborhood's sociological and architectural transformation from bucolic suburb to urban neighborhood through photographs and text. Block next turned her attention to the aesthetics of the university itself. In 1983, the University of Chicago published her second book, Writing in The Uses of Gothic: Planning and Building the Campus of the University of Chicago 1892–1932. Block was a lead author and coordinator of The Uses of Gothic, a 1985 exhibit in the Special Collections Research Center. At the time of her death, Mrs. Block was writing a history of apartment houses and their effect on Chicago neighborhoods from 1910 to 1950.</p><p>Block died in 1988 at the age of 76. She was survived by two children and five grandchildren. The sunken viewing garden directly north of the Joseph Regenstein Library was named the Jean F. Block Memorial Garden after her death.</p><citation>From the guide to the Block, Jean F. Papers, 1980's, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>For the first years of the University of Chicago, there was considerable ambiguity as to its colors. In 1892, a committee of trustees recommended orange and grey as the university's colors, but only the color orange was officially adopted. However, this decision was far from final. Not only did the use of orange upset Syracuse University, it clashed with University of Chicago students' tradition of using gold as the university color. Complicating this was the use of many different shades of orange and gold in different combination at student events. At different points during the early 1890s, gold, yellow, Etruscan gold and orange were used as the colors of the University of Chicago.</p><p>Due to the ambiguity and controversy surrounding the color of the University of Chicago, two meetings were held to determine a new color for the University of Chicago. In the first meeting, scarlet was voted by a large margin as the university color, but in a smaller second meeting maroon was selected. Despite controversy over the choice of maroon and the meeting in which maroon was selected, Marion Talbot, chair of the council tasked with recommending the new color to the trustees, recommended the color maroon to the board of trustees and in 1894 maroon became the color of the University of Chicago.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago.

Collection, 1894-1911, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>The University of Chicago band started in 1898 as the University of Chicago Military Band. It received the hearty support of President William Rainey Harper, himself a cornet player in the band. The first director was physics professor Glenn Moody Hobbs, and the band's first performance was in concert in Kent Hall on December 16, 1898. The band operated initially under the auspices of the athletics department, and members (all men) were paid a modest amount for their service. They performed in uniforms of maroon sweaters, white shirts with maroon ties, white wool pants, and, in inclement weather, overcoats and sailor caps.</p><p>In 1922 C. D. Greenleaf, university and band alumnus and president of the Conn musical instrument company, donated 100 instruments to the band. This donation included Big Bertha, the 8 ½-foot bass drum that became a sort of band mascot. Photocopies of articles and photographs of Big Bertha remain in the University's General Archival File.</p><p>In the late 1920s efforts picked up to make the band a year-round organization, offering concerts outside of football season. In 1935, administrative and financial oversight and support of the band was transferred from the athletic department to the music department. That same year, accomplished bandleader and music educator Harold Bachman was hired as director. As reflected in some of his correspondence, he was also a consultant to the Educational Music Bureau, a Chicago organization devoted to school music. Despite Bachman's leadership, advocacy, and reputation, the band occasionally had a difficult time justifying its musical bona fides (and therefore its existence) to the department. Bachman's tenure at the university ended in 1942 when he was called to active duty in WWII.</p><p>The history of the band is spotty from WWII onwards. After Bachman's departure, the band program largely died out, re-emerging from time to time as a pep band, performing in the stands at athletic events but not performing field shows. The concert band gave occasional performances as well, before the creation of the University Wind Ensemble.</p><p>Big Bertha was sold to a Texas oilman in 1955, who had her refurbished. She is now in the possession of the University of Texas Longhorn Band.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. Band.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Mills Edwin Godwin, Jr., was born November 19, 1914, at Chuckatuck in Nansemond County, now the City of Suffolk, Virginia.</p><p>He completed public school and attended the college of William and Mary. He obtained his degree in law from the University of Virginia in 1938. Honorary doctorate degrees have been awarded him by Elon College, Roanoke College, Elmira College, the College of William and Mary, Washington and Lee University, Hampden-Sydney College, the University of Richmond and Bridgewater College.</p><p>While awaiting a commission in the U. S. Navy in World War II, he was appointed a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he served for three years prior to resuming the practice of law in Suffolk until he was elected governor of Virginia in 1965.</p><p>He first entered politics in 1948 when he began service in the House of Delegates. From 1952 to 1962 he served in the State Senate of Virginia. He was lieutenant-governor of Virginia from 1962 to 1966. During the 26 years he held public office, he ran seventeen times and was never defeated.</p><p>His first election as governor in November 1965, came after he had received the Democratic nomination without opposition.</p><p>During his administration from 1966 to 1970, he became known as \"Virginia's Education Governor,\" taking the lead in upgrading education at every level from kindergarten through graduate school. Initiated and developed during his first term was the State's system of community colleges, two-year colleges offering occupational-technical and liberal arts training at minimum tuition. Salary increases and other improved benefits were granted teachers and faculty members. State aid to kindergartens, summer schools and classes for the handicapped encouraged broader opportunities throughout Virginia, and a number of other innovations were made in the public schools and higher education. The momentum followed a series of governor's conferences on education early in the administration. He persuaded the General Assembly to enact the Retail Sales Tax which was the first new broad-based tax passed in Virginia in more than one hundred years.</p><p>He continued and enlarged the emphasis on industrial development begun by his predecessor, Governor Harrison. He led the first two foreign trade missions and engaged in other efforts designed to attract high caliber new industry to Virginia and to encourage expansion by firms already located in the State. He saw industrial development and education as the principal means of continuing progress in Virginia.</p><p>During his tenure, Virginia made major strides also in water and air pollution control, port and park development, interstate, arterial and other highway construction, highway safety, mental health and other areas of State concern.</p><p>A blue ribbon commission appointed by Godwin proposed the State's first constitutional revision in forty years. The result was approved overwhelmingly by the voters. He also proposed the first general obligation bond issue in this century and led the campaign in which Virginia's voters approved it by a margin of more than two to one.</p><p>As governor he served as chairman of the Southern Regional Education Board, Vice Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference and as a member of the Executive Committee of the Democratic Governors Conference and the National Governors' Conference. He also served as Chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission.</p><p>After serving as governor from 1966 to 1970, he returned home and became a Director of Standard Brands, Inc., Norfolk and Western Railway Company, Union Camp Corporation, Virginia Real Estate Investment Trust, and Dan River, Inc. and served as a member of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors of Virginia National Bank. He was also on the Board of Directors of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation.</p><p>He resigned all of these posts after being elected governor a second time in November 1973, the first man ever twice elected by the people in Virginia to serve as Chief Executive. He was elected as the Republican nominee after being unopposed in their State Convention. He remains the only candidate in the country ever to win gubernatorial elections in the same state on both Democrat and Republican tickets.</p><p>During his second term as governor, he faced a series of crises of major proportions. The Arab oil embargo of late 1973 depressed the State's economy and the State revenues. As governor he ordered reduction of State spending by more than $200 million to keep the budget in balance and, as the economy improved later in his administration, he left a sizable surplus in the budget for his successor. Godwin dealt with the crises of shortages of gasoline, natural gas and fuel oil, the problem of Kepone, ten major floods and seven minor ones and the most serious drought in fifty years occurred in the last year of his administration which caused 115 of the State's 136 political jurisdictions to be designated as disaster areas. Despite these problems, Virginia's forward movement continued during his second term with major improvements in all areas, in job opportunities, and especially in our correctional programs and in public and higher education. He obtained approval from the General Assembly in 1977 for a Referendum on a $125 million General obligation Bond Program, largely earmarked for education and corrections, and again led the campaign which resulted in overwhelming approval for all five bond issues presented to the voters.</p><p>His leadership as governor was evidenced everywhere. Virginia's noted Pulitzer Prize winner and editor, Virginius Dabney, wrote that: \"His two terms combine to form a series of constructive advances for the Commonwealth that are unsurpassed in the long history of Virginia's governors.\"</p><p>As governor from 1974 to 1978, he was Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference, a member of the Executive Committees of the National Governors' Conference and the Republican Governors' Conference. He was Chairman for the second time of the Southern Regional Education Board and Vice President of the Council of State Governments.</p><p>Godwin again returned to his home in Suffolk in January 1978, and served as a consultant to management and a member of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors of the Virginia National Bank. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of Union Camp Corporation, Standard Brands, Inc. and the Royster Company.</p><p>Married to the former Katherine Thomas Beale, Governor Godwin lived in Suffolk where for many years he owned and operated the 500-acre family farm. He has been active in the Oakland Christian Church, where he taught the Men's Bible Class for more than twenty-five years, and engaged in numerous community activities. He was a 33rd degree Mason, past president of Ruritan National, and a member of Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Delta Phi, the Raven Society and Sigma Phi Epsilon. He was the recipient of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce's Distinguished Service Award, the Virginia National Guard's Distinguished Service Medal, the Virginia Education Association's citation as \"Virginia's Education Governor,\" the Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Service from the old Dominion Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America, the Centennial Medal from Hampton Institute, the Virginians of Maryland Medal, the FFA State Farmer Medal, also twice received a First Citizen's Award from Suffolk and Nansemond County, and the Colgate Whitehead Darden, Jr. Award from Norfolk State College, an award exemplifying highest caliber of statesmanship and interest in education in the Commonwealth. Virginia Military Institute has given him its New Market Medal, the highest award made by V.M.I.</p><p>On January 30, 1999, Mills E.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Radio station of the University of Michigan; formerly University of Michigan Broadcasting Service.</p><citation>From the description of WUOM records, 1914-1982. (University of Michigan). WorldCat record id: 34421429</citation><p>Radio broadcasting at the University of Michigan began in 1923 when students in the Department of Electrical Engineering set up a homemade broadcasting station in the West Engineering Building. On January 14, 1924 a federal license was issued, authorizing the university to operate station WCBC on 1,070 kilocycles, with 200 watts of power for unlimited time. However, the equipment was experimental and proved inefficient for more than periodic transmission. Consequently, the department submitted to the regents a request for $20,000 to build a more professional station, and a yearly appropriation of $3000 to maintain it. However, the regents, believing that the university's broadcasting program could be carried out with less expense through the cooperation of a commercial station which had an established audience, refused the request. As a result, when the station's license expired in June 1925, no application for renewal was filed, and the station's privilege was canceled in October.</p><p>Lack of administrative support for funding did not mean lack of support for radio broadcasting. In the same year that WCBC's license was allowed to lapse, the regents established the University of Michigan Broadcasting Service (UMBS) and appointed Waldo Abbot, then instructor in rhetoric in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, as director of the Broadcasting Service, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1957. During the 1925-26 academic year arrangements were made with Detroit radio station WJR for the regular broadcasting of programs originating on the campus, chiefly talks presented by faculty and musical programs by School of Music students and organizations.</p><p>The first of these \"Michigan Night\" programs featured University President Clarence Cook Little, who, in his remarks set forth the broadcasting mission of the university: \"to give to the former students, alumni and alumnae, a few reminders of the spirit of the campus [and] to give to the citizens of the State entertainment and a brief opportunity to become acquainted with certain of the policies which are shaping the efforts [of the university] to serve the State as wisely and as widely as we can.\" [1]</p><p>In 1933 UMBS became a unit of the Extension Division. Though Abbot continued as director of the Broadcasting Service, he was transferred from the Department of English Language and Literature to the Department of Speech and General Linguistics, in which he instituted courses in radio speech, dramatics, and writing. These were \"hands-on\" courses that provided students with both \"on-air\" and \"behind-the-scenes\" broadcasting experience. The functions of the Broadcasting Service were increased to include class instruction, the recording of speech for students and for faculty research, and the making of recordings to be used by University of Michigan alumni clubs.[2] Radio programming throughout the 1930s and 1940s would consist of music instruction, art and vocational guidance to schools, and a host of adult programs featuring the academic and cultural resources of the university.</p><p>One of the first educational institutions to recognize the potential in FM broadcasting--a technological marvel first demonstrated at the 1939 New York World's Fair--the University of Michigan applied for authorization to build a non-commercial frequency modulation station in 1943. Although the FCC granted the permit in 1944, construction was delayed until after World War II, and it wasn't until July 1, 1948 that station WUOM made its debut. Since 1928 UMBS had operated out of a small studio located in Morris Hall. When Morris Hall was torn down to make room for a new administration building (now the Literature, Science and Arts Building) in 1945, UMBS moved into temporary quarters in Angell Hall, while awaiting construction of a \"state of the art\" facility that was to dominate the fifth floor of the new building.</p><p>When it first went on the air in 1948, WUOM offered a daily broadcast schedule of forty to fifty hours per week, with scheduled programming from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Then, as now, the largest percentage of this programming consisted of music: faculty chamber music recitals, regular rehearsals of the University Choir and the Symphony Orchestra, an \"informal program of music appreciation\" hosted by Wiley Hitchcock, and recorded classical music. But the new station did not abandon its commitment to sharing the university's cultural and academic resources; rather, it also offered a fairly diverse schedule of radio plays performed, and often written, by the Radio Guild and students in the Department of Speech, a children's story program, foreign language programs, and talks by university faculty.</p><p>By 1949, when WUOM finally moved into its new studios, Waldo Abbot could boast that \"at the present [the station is] on the air fifty-five hours a week, devoting fifty percent of its time to transcribed and recorded musical programs. Eleven percent [is] live music presented by faculty, students, and organizations connected with the University's School of Music. Ten percent [is] programs in which students participate, such as dramatic programs, round tables, campus news, etc. Sixteen percent [are] presented by members of the university faculties, either in talks, round tables, interviews, or quiz programs. Six percent is devoted to sports and seven percent to public service programs from off-campus sources.\"[3] That fall, WUOM introduced \"Treasures Off the Shelf,\" an original dramatic series based upon manuscript materials in the university's Clements Library. This series, the first of many such series WUOM would produce over the next twenty years, not only proved popular with listeners, but received a First Award from the Institute for Education by Radio.</p><p>Prior to 1950 the focus of WUOM programming had been on adult education and enrichment. That fall, however, the station inaugurated the Radio Classroom, through which it offered the university's academic and cultural resources to school systems throughout the state of Michigan. The first--and longest running--of the Radio Classroom series was \"Festival of Song,\" a program of music instruction and singing lessons designed to enhance the classroom experience of every child. Though the series was first limited to schools in Washtenaw County, response was so positive that by 1952 Radio Classroom series were being carried, either via direct relay or distributed programming, by sixteen stations state-wide, including the Upper Peninsula. When WUOM celebrated its tenth anniversary on July 5, 1958, President Harlan H. Hatcher enthusiastically cited the station's efforts to \"extend the important educational resources of the University to an ever-increasing audience ranging from pre-school youngsters to senior adult citizens... Through the maintenance of professional standards and the recognition of radio as serious art, educational broadcasters have made an important contribution to modern methods of communication. We are confident that the next decade will see the leadership of educational broadcasting extended, and the service of the University's own WUOM to the people of the State of Michigan enriched and expanded.\"[4]</p><p>The next decade did indeed see an extension of both leadership and service by WUOM, as well as significant changes in how that service was carried out. In 1961 WUOM received FCC permission to construct an FM station in West Michigan, in order to relay WUOM programming to the metropolitan areas of Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, and Muskegon. WVGR began broadcasting on December 2 of that same year. Though WUOM had always been closely affiliated with the National Association of Educational Broadcasting and its affiliate, National Educational Radio, the 1960s saw an increase in staff involvement. Particularly significant is the role played by station manager Edgar Burrows whose tenure as NAEB chairman encompassed the critical Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as well as the controversy concerning copyright law revision, and NAEB's 1967 reorganizational study.</p><p>Though still responsive to its listeners' preferences for classical music programming, and still committed to its long-standing policy of extending the University's academic and cultural resources to the people of the State of Michigan, in 1960 the station began to increase its emphasis on news reporting and analysis, as well as on broadcasting more of the issues-oriented public lectures and panel discussions held on campus. By 1969 WUOM felt that local, national, and international events were requiring them to spend more time \"interpreting the proper role of the University to the general public, explaining and analyzing the nature of internal conflicts in the light of national and international events, and bringing to the University community itself as balanced and detailed a reporting of events on and off campus as possible.\"[5] Consequently, long-time musical program favorites like The Record Collector, Afternoon Musicale, and Music of the Masters increasingly shared the broadcast schedule with protest rallies, teach-ins and sit-ins, and special sessions of the University Senate.</p><p>Subsequent decades have brought even more changes to WUOM--new network affiliation, rapidly changing technologies, budget uncertainties, personnel and leadership turnovers--all of which have, in some way, influenced station operation and programming. Nevertheless the station remains faithful to the mission established in the 1940s by the University Executive Committee on Radio, to \"interpret and report to its audience the various activities of the University with emphasis upon education, research, and training with the intent to develop a broader knowledge, a fuller understanding and deeper appreciation of the humanities, of the sciences, and of social, economic, and civic problems [as well as offering] entertainment consistent with the policies and practices of an institution of higher learning.\"[6]</p><p>___________________________</p><p>1--Radio Programs Given at the University of Michigan During the Year 1925-1926, Printed Materials, box 34, WUOM, Bentley Historical Library (BHL).</p><p>2--\"A Report on Radio Broadcasting at the University of Michigan\", 1943, Annual and miscellaneous reports, 1933-1945, box 32.</p><p>3--\"WUOM of the University of Michigan,\" Collins Radio Company, Cedar Rapids, Iowa [1949?], Printed Materials, box 32.</p><p>4--WUOM Program Schedule, October 1958, Printed Materials, box 32.</p><p>5--University of Michigan Broadcasting Service - Radio WUOM/WVGR Annual Report, 1968-70, Printed Materials, box 32.</p><p>6--University of Michigan Broadcasting Service - Radio Station WUOM [By-laws], Executive Committee on Radio, 1947-1948, box 2.</p><citation>From the guide to the WUOM records, 1914-1982, 1940s-1960s, (Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)</citation></biogHist>",

Library. University of California, Library Special Collections)</citation><p>George Antheil was born on July 8, 1900 in Trenton, New Jersey. His parents were Henry William and Wilhelmine Huse Antheil. Although Antheil claimed to be of Polish descent, he was actually German and grew up speaking both German and English. He attended Trenton Central High School, but there is no indication that he graduated. Antheil studied piano lessons at an early age and in 1919 began to study with Constantin Ivanovich Edler von Sternberg at the Sternberg School of Music. He also briefly studied piano at the Settlement Music School. In his autobiography, Bad Boy of Music, Antheil claimed to have been a student alternately at the Curtis Institute of Music and what he refers to as the \"Curtis Settlement School,\" which did not exist. Both of these statements were untrue.</p><p>Antheil traveled around Europe as a concert pianist playing \"modern music\" as well as his own compositions. Antheil became friends with many of the important intellectuals of that time, including Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound. During this time, and for quite a few years after, Antheil was financially subsidized by Mary Louise Curtis Bok (who founded the Curtis Institute of Music). While in Europe, Antheil met a student named Böski Marcus from Hungary. They married in 1925. Antheil's best known piece during the 1920s was a composition entitled Ballet Mécanique scored for piano and percussion. The American premiere of this piece was deemed a failure and Antheil's reputation was never the same.</p><p>In the 1930s, Antheil moved to California and concentrated on writing film scores for such directors as Man Ray and Cecil B. DeMille. He continued to compose symphonies during this time. His 1953 opera, Volpone, opened to mixed reviews, but Antheil continued to write.</p><p>In addition to composing, George Antheil was interested in writing in general. He was a music critic, contributed columns to Esqure and other periodicals, and wrote two detective novels based on his hobby of studying glandular endocrinology. His autobiography, Bad Boy of Music, was a bestseller. Antheil is also credited to co-inventing (with Hedy Lamarr) a torpedo guidance system.</p><p>George Antheil died of a heart attack in 1959.</p><citation>From the guide to the George Antheil Papers, 1919-1959., (Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library)</citation></biogHist>",

The program, called Say Brother, debuted July 15, 1968, and offered a variety of public affairs programming relevant to African American communities throughout the United States, such as the desegregation of schools, civil rights, Black political leadership, religion, African liberation, and popular culture, while ensuring coverage of issues in Boston's African American neighborhoods, such as affordable housing, community clinics and health care facilities, local student movements, state politics, and community schooling.</p><p>Say Brother's early producers included Jim Boyd, Ray Richardson, and John Slade (through 1973) and Topper Carew and Marita Rivero (through the 1975 season). In the fall of 1975, under Rivero's direction, Say Brother aired thirteen programs developed specifically for a national audience for broadcast by PBS. National programming, however, was short-lived, and Say Brother quickly returned to being locally-televised in the winter of 1976. Between the fall of 1976 and spring of 1983, Barbara Barrow-Murray produced the program, significantly adding multicultural content (through the 1980 season) that incorporated issues in Boston's Chinese American, Hispanic American and Native American communities. Successive producers--Beth Deare, Juanita Anderson, and Cynthia Johnson--have continued to program based on social, cultural, economic, and intellectual issues relevant to African Americans. The program was renamed Basic Black in 1998.</p><citation>From the description of Say Brother Television Program Collection,f1968-1982. (Unknown). WorldCat record id: 180705492</citation><p>The Ten O'Clock News was a nightly news program produced and broadcast by WGHBH, a public television station located in Boston, Massachusetts. The Ten O'Clock News succeeded Evening Compass, a news program broadcast on WGBH in 1974 and 1975. Evening Compass found an audience through its in-depth coverage of school desegregation in Boston, which began in 1974. Reporters Pam Bullard, Ed Baumeister, Paul de Give, Gary Griffith, Greg Pilkington, Judy Stoia and others covered press conferences with city officials, protests by activists on both sides of the issue and the effect of court-ordered desegregation on the Boston Public School System. The Ten O'Clock News debuted in 1976, and many of the Evening Compass staff members worked on the show.</p><p>Christopher Lydon signed on to anchor The Ten O'Clock News in 1977, and was joined by a series of four co-anchors, including Gail Harris in 1984 and Carmen Fields in 1987. The program featured nightly in-studio interviews as well as coverage of local, national and international issues by a group of reporters including Christy George, Marcus Jones, Meg Vaillancourt, David Boeri and Hope Kelly. The program was broadcast on WGBH until May 1991. The Ten O'Clock News Project has preserved 523 tapes from the Ten O'Clock News library. The tapes focus on news stories related to Boston's African American community, and include coverage of school desegregation in Boston, race relations, politics, education, health care, urban issues and the arts.</p><citation>From the description of The Ten O'Clock News Project, 1974-1991.

A room was set aside for use as a studio and control room and a radio director and program director were hired. Courses such as \"Radio Broadcasting\" and \"Radio Writing\" were offered through the Department of Speech and \"Radio News\" in the Department of Journalism. In addition, two graduate courses were initiated: \"Radio in Education\" in the School in Education and \"Radio Seminar\" in the Department of Speech.</p><p>At the Board of Trustees September 20, 1945 meeting, they approved the establishment of a Department of Radio as an \"unattached department\" under the Dean of Faculties. Beginning the fall of 1950, IU offered a B.S. in Radio and listed the courses under the College of Arts and Sciences, but it wasn't until 1953 that Radio officially began a part COAS, when the Trustees approved the establishment of the Department of Radio and Television. In 1974, the Trustees approved a name change to the Department of Telecommunications in order to better reflect the expanded scope of their academic program. This change went into effect on July 1.</p><p>Harry Skornia served as Director of Radio Programs (and chair of the department once it was established) from 1942-1953.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Lee Metcalf was born in 1911 in Stevensville, Montana. He attended Montana State University for one year and transferred to Stanford University where he majored in history and economics. He graduated from Montana State University law school in 1936 and entered private practice. He was elected representative to the 25th Montana Legislative Assembly from Ravalli County in the same year. In 1937 Metcalf resigned from the legislature to accept appointment as a Montana assistant attorney general.</p><p>During his tenure as an assistant attorney general, Metcalf campaigned extensively for Attorney General Harrison Freebourn who was seeking election to the U.S. Senate in the 1940 primary. During this period Metcalf also represented the Montana State Congress of Industrial Organizations Council from 1938 until 1941. In 1941, following Freebourn's defeat in the primary, Metcalf returned to private practice in Hamilton. Metcalf enlisted in the army in 1942 and was later commissioned. Following the war he served as a military government officer in Germany where he helped set up the civilian court and occupation police system. He also supervised repatriation and drafted the ordinances for and supervised local elections.</p><p>Metcalf was elected associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court in 1946, where he served until he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1952, succeeding Mike Mansfield in Montana's First (Western) Congressional District. After serving four terms in the House, Metcalf was elected to the Senate in 1960, succeeding James E. Murray.</p><p>Although Metcalf is best known for his work to protect the natural environment and regulate utilities, he composed and supported a wide variety of legislation. His prodigious legislative accomplishments are testimony to his parliamentary acumen.</p><p>Lee Metcalf worked throughout his career to protect the nation's natural resources from both wanton exploitation and destruction. He was an early proponent of water and air pollution control; research on the harmful effects of pesticides, strip mining, and highway construction; regulation of timber cutting and grazing; alternative energy development; and many other conservation issues. His efforts to preserve the nation's wild lands and rivers were productive and lauded by national conservation organizations. As a long-time member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Metcalf helped establish many wildlife refuges.</p><p>While Lee Metcalf was an ardent protector of the natural environment, he believed in the responsible development of resources. He supported rural cooperative efforts, public power projects, and diverse types of assistance to independent workers in agriculture and minerals.</p><p>Metcalf advocated the use of government resources to redress the injustices of an imperfect society and to broaden and strengthen access to information for all individuals. He proposed and worked for legislation concerning Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and veterans' benefits; aid to libraries, schools and small businesses; minimum wage laws; work safety laws; job training programs; consumer protection; and the return of control over their own lives to Native Americans.</p><p>Metcalf's long, adverserial relationship with the Montana Power Company and other utilities stemmed from his belief that the power industry held a monopolistic, unregulated control of an essential product. Lee Metcalf's and Vic Reinemer's book Overcharge delineates their position that the utilities exert tremendous influence throughout American society, yet are not subject to the democratic election process and are controlled by a small group of profiteers.</p><p>Closely related to Metcalf's efforts to regulate utility companies was his opposition to the growth of \"corporate statism.\" Especially in his capacity as chairman of the Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditure (later Reports, Accounting, and Management), and in close association with Vic Reinemer, Metcalf worked for disclosure of meaningful information, such as interlocking directorships, regarding corporate activity in regulated industries.</p><p>Congressional colleagues respected Lee Metcalf's thorough knowledge of the workings of government, knowledge which he used astutely throughout his career. In 1959 Metcalf helped establish the Democratic Study Group, an organization which instructed, mobilized, and coordinated liberal Democrats. As a member of the Government Operations Committee, Metcalf worked for many years, especially after Watergate activities spotlighted such concerns, to reorganize government to improve its efficiency and honesty.</p><p>Lee Metcalf enjoyed the cooperation of an able staff. He also provided experience to as many interns, the majority of whom were Montanans, as his time and office space would allow.</p><p>Vic Reinemer joined Metcalf's staff in 1961 and worked closely with him until Metcalf's death. Reinemer was born in Circle, Montana, in 1923, and graduated from Montana State University with a B.A. in journalism in 1948. He worked as a newspaper editor in Washington, D.C., for Freedom amp; Union Magazine in 1950 and 1951, and in North Carolina for the Charlotte News from 1950 until 1955. From 1955 until 1960 Reinemer worked as executive secretary for Senator Murray and then served until 1973 in the same position for Senator Metcalf. From 1973 until Metcalf's death in 1978, Reinemer was staff director of the Senate Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditures, which changed its name in 1975 to Reports, Accounting, and Management. Reinemer concentrated his energies on utility regulation and corporate ownership reporting.</p><p>Other long-time influential staff members include Merrill \"Brit\" Englund, Metcalf's administrative assistant, who worked for United Press Internatinnal and the Associated Press in Helena for six years before joining Metcalf's staff in 1953; Peggy McLaughlin, personal secretary, who worked for the Montana State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Montana Attorney General, and for Senator Murray before beginning her years with Metcalf; and Dorothy Tannenbaum, legislative assistant with special knowledge of education and Native American affairs. Ted Roe replaced Vic Reinemer as executive secretary in 1973. These staff members' contribution to Metcalf's work can most easily be noted by the many letters in the collection which they composed.</p><p>Lee Metcalf married Donna Hoover in 1938. He died in January 1978 during what he declared would be his last Senate term.</p><citation>From the guide to the Lee Metcalf Papers, 1934-1978, (Montana Historical Society Research Center)</citation></biogHist>",

This was only the beginning of an outstanding career which continues into the year 2000. Not only has he proved himself an accomplished writer, he has also spent more than sixty years piloting, climbing, mapping, and exploring the highest mountains in North America, the Alps, and Mount Everest. Along with Barbara, his wife, they have mapped Mt. McKinley, the Grand Canyon and Mount Everest.</p><p>Washburn earned his pilot's license in 1934. He was also fascinated with radio and became an expert in aeronautical radio navigation. In 1937 he spent a weekend with Amelia Earhart and her husband, George Putnam. Because he was well known to Putnam, skilled as a pilot, a radio operator and had lots of experience in the Lockheed Electra, Washburn was considered for Earhart's round the world flight. However, he backed out because of safety considerations.</p><p>He has served as the Director of Boston's Museum of Science from 1939 until his retirement in 1980.

He was educated at the Harvard School for Boys and Hyde Park High School. He received his B.A. from Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1941. In 1944, he received his masters degree at the University of Chicago. During the early 1960s, White received several honorary degrees including an LH.D. from Lawrence College in 1961 and a LL.D. from Cornell College in Iowa in 1964. He married Joan Glasow in May of 1943 with whom he would have three children Susan, Michael, and Christopher.</p><p>From 1941 to 1944, White was the Admissions Counsellor at Lawrence. White returned to Illinois in 1944 to become the Director of Admissions at the Illinois Institute of Technology. White stayed at the Illinois Institute of Technology for six years. He served as Assistant Dean of Students from 1945 to 1946, Dean of Students from 1946 to 1948, and Dean and Director of the Development Program from 1948 to 1950. In 1950, White left the Institute of Technology for Western Reserve University where he was offered the position of Vice President. During his five year tenure, White made his initial move into educational broadcasting as he pioneered development of television as an educational tool at Western Reserve.</p><p>He left his job as Vice President in 1955 to move to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and to become the General Manager of WQED . During 1956, he lectured at the University of Pittsburgh. WQED won the Peabody Award for its programming in 1957. White left WQED in 1958 to become President of the National Educational Television and Radio Center . During his tenure as President, there were a few unsuccessful attempts to bring educational television to the New York City area. White helped form Educational Television for the Metropolitan Area Inc. in 1961 and served as its secretary and as a board member to further this goal. In 1962, WNDT New York went on the air, becoming one of the country's outstanding ETV operations by 1968. In 1963, the National Educational Television and Radio Center put aside all its functions except for non-instructional television programming. It changed its name to National Educational Television and focused on cultural and public affairs programming. John White served as president of the National Educational Television and Radio Center from 1963 to 1969 .</p><p>After eleven years in public broadcasting, White returned to education in 1969 to serve as President of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. During this period, he began collaborating on a history of public broadcasting that was never completed. He retired from active work in 1990 but he continued to work as a consultant for the Aspen Institute from 1980 to 1988.</p><p>White was very active in his community through directorships in several companies including Orange and Rockland Utilities Inc. and Viacom International Inc. and participation in local clubs such as the Century, Tuxedo, and University Clubs. He was also an active church member. He served as Trustee of St. John the Divine in New York City from 1978 to 1988 and as a Vestryman of St. Mary's Church in Tuxedo Park from 1979 to 1986.</p><citation>From the guide to the John F.

WorldCat record id: 84186913</citation><p>On October 13, 1997, Jennifer Gratz, an unsuccessful white applicant for the Fall 1995 term, and Patrick Hamacher, an unsuccessful white applicant for the Fall 1997 term, brought a lawsuit in district court against the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A). On December 3, 1997, Barbara Grutter, an unsuccessful white applicant for the Fall 1997 entering class, brought a similar suit against the Law School. The plaintiffs sued both the university and specific university officials, including President Lee Bollinger, President Emeritus James Duderstadt, and Law School Dean Jeffrey Lehman, in their individual and official capacities. Both cases were certified as class actions for purposes of reviewing the policies at issue.</p><p>The Center for Individual Rights (CIR), a nonprofit public interest law firm located in Washington, D.C., represented the plaintiffs, with the Minneapolis law firm of Maslon, Edelman, Borman, &amp; Brand serving as lead counsel. The CIR had been active in conducting lawsuits seeking to dismantle affirmative action in college admissions and racial preference in a variety of arenas, including a successful case against the University of Texas Law School ( Hopwood v. State of Texas ). The university's lead counsel for the suits was John Payton, a civil rights attorney of the Washington D.C. law firm of Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering, with local counsel provided by Butzel Long of Detroit.</p><p>The plaintiffs in the cases charged that the university unlawfully discriminated against them by taking race and ethnicity into account as a positive factor in admissions. They sought injunctive relief and monetary damages. The university took the position that the Constitution and civil rights statutes, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in its 1978 decision in the case of University of California v. Bakke, permitted it to consider race and ethnicity in its admissions in order to achieve the educational benefits of a diverse student body. (The Bakke decision stated that there must be a \"compelling governmental interest\" to justify the use of race in admissions. The university asserted that diversity was just such an interest.)</p><p>In both lawsuits, groups of students and citizens petitioned to intervene in support of the university's admissions policy. Although their intervention was initially denied by the district courts, in August 1999 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit allowed the intervention and made the student and citizen groups full parties in the case. The intervenors defended the university's policy on the basis that it was needed to remedy past and/or present discrimination against people of color. In the LS&amp;A case, the intervenors included 17 African-American and Latino students who applied or planned to apply to the university and the group Citizens for Affirmative Action Preservation. In the Law School case, the intervenors included 41 students and three groups: United for Equality and Affirmative Action, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means Necessary, and Law Students for Affirmative Action.</p><p>Many organizations and entities filed \"friend of the Court\" (amicus) briefs in the Court of Appeals for both sides of the case. Organizations filing briefs in support of the university's position included General Motors Corporation, the American Bar Association, the American Council on Education, the National Organization for Women (NOW) Legal Defense Fund, the Attorney General of Michigan, and a group of Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Intel, Pfizer and others. Organizations filing amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs included the National Association of Scholars.</p><p>On December 13, 2000, Judge Patrick Duggan ruled without a trial and granted summary judgment in the university's favor in the Gratz case. Finding that the pursuit of the educational benefits of diversity is a compelling governmental interest, he ruled that the university's current admissions policy, in place since 1999, was fully constitutional, but that its admissions policy from 1995 to 1998 was unconstitutional. In a separate opinion, Duggan rejected the intervenors' alternative argument defending the policy. CIR has petitioned to appeal the judgment about the current admissions process and the university has petitioned to cross-appeal the ruling on the unconstitutionality of the admissions process for the years 1995 to 1998.</p><p>From January 16 through February 16, 2001, a limited trial on the specifics of the Law School admissions process was held. On March 27, 2001, Judge Bernard Friedman issued a decision for Grutter finding that the educational benefits of diversity were not a compelling interest, and that the specifics of the Law School's policy were not \"narrowly tailored\" to that interest. He also struck down the intervenors' defense, saying that it was essentially based on remedying societal discrimination and impermissible. He issued an order that the Law School cease considering race in its admissions process. The university immediately appealed the ruling and filed a motion for a stay of injunction. On April 5, 2001, the Court of Appeals issued a stay of the District Court order, allowing the Law School to continue using its current admissions policy while the appeal proceeds.</p><p>In October 2001, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the plaintiffs' motion for hearing oral arguments en banc. The hearings were scheduled for December 2001. In May 2002 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held in the Grutter case that the Law School's admissions policy is constitutional, reversing the March 27, 2001 decision of Judge Friedman. From August 2002 to October 2002 petitions for certiorari, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to view the Grutter and Gratz case were filed. In December 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari before judgment on the Constitutional issue only in Gratz and granted certiorari in the Grutter case. Oral arguments were heard before the U.S. Supreme Court in Gratz and Grutter on April 1, 2003. A decision from the U.S. Supreme Court was delivered on June 23, 2003. In a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court justices upheld the University of Michigan Law School admissions policy ( Grutter v. Bollinger, et. al ) and in a 6-3 vote struck down the university's undergraduate admissions policy ( Gratz and Hamacher v. Bollinger, et. al). On July 18, 2003, the plaintiff in Grutter v. Bollinger et al. filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting to rehear the case. The petition for rehearing of Grutter was denied on August 25, 2003.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the University Michigan Office of Undergraduate Admissions has announced a new process for reviewing student applications that will include more individualized review. This process will be in place for those students applying for admissions for the Fall 2004 term.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Michigan admissions lawsuits collection, 1995-2003, (Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)</citation></biogHist>",

Born February 17, 1904, in Coburg (Germany), died July 19, 1980, New York, NY (USA)</p><p>Educated at the universities of Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich, Morgenthau trained as a passed to bar and practiced in Munich from 1927 to 1930, when he became a teaching assistant at the University of Frankfurt. From 1931 to 1933 he served as acting president of the Frankfurt labor court. In 1932, he went also to Geneva to teach public law for a year, but because of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933, he stayed on until 1935. In 1935/36, he taught in Madrid, where he was professor of international law at the Madrid Institute of International and Economic Studies. Morgenthau immigrated to the United States in 1937 (naturalized 1943).</p><p>He served on the faculties of Brooklyn College (1937-39), the University of Kansas City (1939-43), and from 1943 to 1971 taught international politics at the University of Chicago. In 1950 he became the director of the Center for Study of American Foreign and Military Policy. From 1968 to 1974 he was professor of political science at the City College of New York. Furthermore Morgenthau taught at the New School for Social Research from 1974 to 1980 and also served as consultant to the U.S. Department of State and Defense, as well as commentator on U.S. current affairs.</p><p>Morgenthau was a predominant figure in the post-World War II effort to refocus the study of international relations on the observed regularities of human conduct, rather than the idealistic pursuit of abstract norms. This political realism gained wide influence with the publication of his Scientific Man vs. Power Politics (1947) and especially Politics among Nations (1949), a highly regarded study that presented a modern realist approach to international politics, which became the leading text in field. Central to Morgenthau's theory was the concept of power as the dominant goal in international politics and the definition of national interest in terms of power. He called for recognition of the nature and limits of power and for the use of traditional methods of diplomacy, including compromise.</p><p>A contributor to numerous scholarly periodicals and journals of opinion, Morgenthau was also the author of In Defense of the National Interest (1951), Dilemmas of Politics (1958), The Purpose of American Politics (1960), Politics in the Twentieth Century, 3 vol. (1962), and Truth and Power (1970). Many of Morgenthau's writings were translated into foreign languages.</p><p>Hans Morgenthau was married to Irma Morgenthau (neé Thormann). Their son Matthew was born in 1942, when Hans Morgenthau was 38 years old. In 1944, a daughter Susanna was born.</p><citation>From the guide to the Hans Morgenthau Collection, 1904-1980, (Leo Baeck Institute Archives)</citation></biogHist>",

Library. Dept. of Special Collections)</citation><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins, (1899-1977) was educated at Oberlin and Yale. A dynamic lecturer and administrator, Hutchins began his career as a professor and administrator at Yale Law School. Following the 1928 resignation of Max Mason, Hutchins was considered as part of a long list of candidates for President. His experience and qualifications were much debated, but Hutchins was finally elected in 1929, at the age of 30.</p><p>Almost immediately, Hutchins began making high-profile media appearances, and gained a national presence as a public intellectual and representative of academic ideals. His visionary and sometimes iconoclastic positions promoted the University as a site of vital, innovative intellectual activity.</p><p>Seeing his role as one of leadership and public relationship, Hutchins had his title changed to \"Chancellor\" in 1945. The title of \"President\" now referred to the university's administrative chief, a post filled by Ernest Cadman Colwell. The title of \"Chancellor\" was changed back to \"President\" in 1961, early in the administration of George W. Beadle.</p><p>Hutchins spearheaded dramatic and often controversial changes to the university's administrative structure. Graduate departments were reformed within divisions of biological sciences, physical sciences, humanities, and social sciences. A critic of undergraduate specialization and vocational study, Hutchins overhauled the bachelor's degree program to focus on liberal education, \"Great Books,\" and general studies. Undergraduate programs within academic departments were consolidated into the College, reporting to a single Dean. Causing the most public controversy was the elimination of varsity football, which Hutchins and his supporters saw as a distraction from the mission of the university.</p><p>Hutchins attracted loyal admirers who supported the University of Chicago through difficult and contentious times, including the Great Depression, World War II, and challenges to academic freedom. While many of his positions were controversial, and some of his reforms were overturned in later years, the ideals of the University of Chicago, as well as its public image, are largely the legacy of the Hutchins administration.</p><citation>From the guide to the University of Chicago. Office of the President. Hutchins Administration. Records, 1892-1951, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>Walter Paul Paepcke was born on June 29, 1896, in Chicago, Illinois. He was the son of Hermann Paepcke, a Prussian immigrant, and Paula Wagner Paepcke. Walter attended the University School for Boys and the Boy's Latin School where he graduated in 1913. He received a degree in economics and history from Yale University in 1917 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. From 1918 to 1919, Walter served as an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve Forces. During this same time he also attended night classes at the Kent College of Law.</p><p>Walter's father Hermann was the president of the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company, which was described in 1909 as being the largest lumber and box company in the country. In the spring of 1919, after being honorably discharged from the U.S. Naval Reserve Forces, Walter came to work at his father's company as the assistant to the treasurer. He held this position until 1921 when upon his father's death he became president.</p><p>Through the influence of his parents, who were lovers of music and literature. Walter began a lifelong dedication to promoting and preserving the arts. Due in large part to his father, Walter began a relationship with the cultural community of the University of Chicago. It was in this cultural community that Walter became friends with Professor William A. Nitze, chairman of the Department of Romance Languages, and his family. In 1922, Walter married Professor Nitze's daughter, Elizabeth Nitze, and together Walter and Elizabeth began to make considerable contributions to the liberal arts.</p><p>In 1926 Walter assumed dual positions in both the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company and a new company he founded called the Container Corporation of America. This new company had begun as a side line business making paper containers during the economically lean period of World War I. Walter saw the potential of this new enterprise and merged it with businesses he had recently acquired, the Philadelphia Paper Manufacturing Company and the Midwest Box Company. By the late 1940s the Container Corporation of America (CCA) had become the largest domestic producer of paper containers.</p><p>Walter had an unusual vision for his new company. CCA set out to promote the service offered by its products not the product itself. It could be said that every household contained something made by CCA. Walter also felt that design was central to the success of his new enterprise. In the 1930s Walter Paepcke and CCA became innovators that brought the concept of modern design and business together. CCA launched an advertising campaign that established the company as the best known in the industry. It also helped to focus considerable light on the modern art and design world. By 1955 Walter was honored for his vision and named Industrial Advertiser of the Year.</p><p>Beyond his business interests, Walter and Elizabeth were patrons and promoters of the musical, literary, and artistic worlds. Walter Paepcke served as a trustee or as a member of the board of directors for the University of Chicago, Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago Orchestral Association, Cliff Dwellers Club, Great Books Foundation, and the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</p><p>One unique project Walter Paepcke undertook was a festival in honor of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. His friend, Robert Hutchins, chancellor of the University of Chicago, and Professor Guiseppe Borgese came to him in 1947 with the idea of honoring the German philosopher and poet on the 200th anniversary of his birth. Walter had read Goethe's writings since his youth and was very much in favor of helping to create a program to honor Goethe. A short time earlier on a trip to Colorado, Walter had seen the town of Aspen and its surrounding countryside. After searching unsuccessfully for a location near Chicago for the celebration, the group decided that the festival could be held in Aspen, Colorado. With considerable involvement on Walter's part, especially financially, the festival took place in June 1949. As a result of the work Walter did to help organize the Goethe Bicentennial Festival, he began purchasing property in and around Aspen for future development.</p><p>The development of Aspen, Colorado led to Walter Paepcke's most ambitious undertaking. Spurred by the success of the Goethe Festival, Walter established the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in 1950. The Aspen Institute, a non-profit institute, was to be an intellectual and cultural center of continuing education. Part of its programs were geared towards giving executives the opportunity to understand their role in society and to develop goals and convictions for their lives.</p><p>It was said that Walter Paepcke sold big business on its responsibilities as a purveyor of culture. He devoted a lifetime to the patronage of the arts while building and leading a company that became the nation's largest producer of paperboard containers. Paepcke died in Chicago on April 13, 1960.</p><citation>From the guide to the Paepcke, Walter P. Papers, 1912-1961, (Special Collections Research Center University of Chicago Library 1100 East 57th Street Chicago, Illinois 60637 U.S.A.)</citation><p>Robert Maynard Hutchins (1899-1977) was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of William James Hutchins, a professor of theology who ultimately became President of Berea College (Kentucky). Hutchins enrolled at Oberlin (where his father taught) in 1915 but discontinued his undergraduate studies in 1917 to serve with the Ambulance Corps of the U. S. Army. For his conduct, he was decorated by the Italian government. He resumed his education at Yale in 1919, graduating in 1921.</p><p>He graduated from the Yale Law School in 1925 while also serving as Secretary of the University since 1923. He joined the faculty of the Law School in 1925, becoming a full professor in 1927. He became Acting Dean (1927) and then Dean of the Law School in 1928. While at Yale, he was instrumental in creating the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary center for the legal, medical, and sociological study of contemporary social problems.</p><p>Hutchins' youth made his appointment as President of the University of Chicago something of a surprise, but according to Harold Swift, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, the search committee was concerned to find an individual with the personality and the intellectual drive to fill the position. Hutchins' gregarious nature and his commitment to curriculum reform, evident at Yale, seemed to make him an ideal candidate to provide the kind of leadership and vision that the University had not had since William Rainey Harper.</p><p>The initial years of Hutchins' administration were dramatic ones. He accepted and implemented plans for a general reorganization of the University that had been in the works since the administration of Ernest D. Burton (1923-25). These reforms were intended to simplify the administrative structure of the University, to promote interdisciplinary work among the faculty, and to redefine the undergraduate curriculum. The so-called \"New Plan\" or \"Chicago Plan\" created four graduate divisions-Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Biological Sciences – and established a consolidated College as a separate division of the University. Hutchins' major interest, however, was in the nature and goals of undergraduate education in general and the College in particular. Curricular reforms, with which his name has become more or less synonymous, emphasized the role of the College in providing general education grounded in philosophy and philosophical analysis. Impatient with the increasingly fine division of academic labor and the intensification of research specialization, Hutchins became an outspoken advocate of the value of general education. He lectured tirelessly on the meaning of college and seemed to relish his self-assumed role as a leading American educator.</p><p>Hutchins' candor and glibness, his self-confidence and (to some) his dogmatism were mixed blessings. The Walgreen investigations (1935) into possible subversive activities on the part of certain faculty at the University put Hutchins in the public eye as an eloquent defender of academic freedom against the claims of naive xenophobes. On the other hand, his style and opinions antagonized parts of the faculty who came to resent what they interpreted as arrogance and a sort of \"party line\" within the University. Their fears of Hutchins' power and their perception of the declining role of faculty governance at the University, stood behind the Senate Memorial (1944) to the Board of Trustees. Protesting some of Hutchins' assertions about the role of the University in contemporary society, the Memorial coincided with widespread administrative reforms designed at least in part to more clearly define the respective roles of the President and the University Senate in the making of educational policy.</p><p>As a public figure, Hutchins championed a variety of issues and causes. Although he opposed America's entry into World War II, he cooperated with the government in the establishment of the Metallurgical Laboratory (1942) on campus as part of the Manhattan Project. Following the war, Hutchins was in the forefront of groups seeking to control the destructive potential of nuclear energy and to evaluate the broader implications of scientific research. He was sympathetic to the idea of a single world order (which he could trace to Thomas Aquinas) and in 1945 established, at the request of G. A. Borgese and Richard McKeon, the Committee to Frame a World Constitution. One year earlier he had been appointed chairman of the Commission on the Freedom of the Press. Funded by grants from Time, Inc. and the Encyclopedia Britanica (of which Hutchins had been a director since 1943), the Commission inquired into the nature, function, duties, and responsibilities of the press in America. It was particularly sensitive to the constraints on a free press in the contemporary world.</p><p>Controversial and opinionated, Hutchins served as President (and then as Chancellor) of the University longer than any other individual. He retired in 1951 to assume the Directorship of the Ford Foundation.</p><citation>From the guide to the Hutchins, Robert M., and Associates.

Board members also play a role in the selection of Presidents of the College as well as those who receive honorary degrees from Mount Holyoke. The Board was established in 1836 and consisted of several \"benevolent gentlemen\" who helped Mary Lyon plan a school for the higher education of women and would its own property and not be a for-profit venture. The original trustees were Joseph Avery, William Bowdoin, David Choate, Joseph Condit, Roswell Hawks, Edward Hitchcock, Heman Humphrey, Andrew W. Potter, Daniel Safford, John Todd, William Tyler, and Samuel Williston. The first woman trustee, Sarah Williston, was appointed to the Board in 1884. Mount Holyoke Principals and Presidents have also been members of the Board since that year. In 1892, in an effort to strengthen the cooperation between the Board and alumnae in planning for the growth and welfare of Mount Holyoke, the trustees invited alumnae of the College to nominate one individual annually to serve on the Board for a three-year term. The trustees changed this practice in 1899 by asking the Alumnae Association to submit names of three alumnae candidates to fill each vacancy on the Board. The practice of adding a Young Alumnae Trustee to the Board began in 1970. The trustees have diverse backgrounds and are primarily drawn from academia, human services, politics and government, and the corporate world. Notable individuals who have served on the Board include Virginia Apgar (Class of 1929), Germaine Bree, Barbara Cassani (Class of 1982), Mary Phylinda Dole (Class of 1886), A. Bartlett Giamatti, August Heckscher, Alice Stone Ilchman (Class of 1957), Henry Plimpton Kendall, Janet Brewster Murrow (Class of 1933), Frances Perkins (Class of 1902), Gloria Johnson Powell (Class of 1958), Joseph and William Skinner, and Henry A. Stimson.</p><citation>From the guide to the Trustees Biographical Files RG 3. 2., ca. 1836-, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was established by educator Mary Lyon, who in 1832 began making plans for a school for the higher education of women that would own its own property and not be a for-profit venture. She enlisted the support of several clergymen and businessmen in and around Ipswich, Massachusetts, where she had been working as a teacher at Ipswich Female Seminary since 1828. Seven of these individuals - David Choate, Daniel Dana, Joseph Felt, George W. Heard, Edward Hitchcock, Asa Howland, and Theophilus Packard - formed a committee in September, 1834 that selected South Hadley, Massachusetts as the location for the school and worked to obtain a charter for the institution from the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that was granted on February 11, 1836. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary opened on November 7, 1837. The academic program expanded from three to four years in 1861/62 and students who completed the prescribed course of study received diplomas. In the late 1880s, in response to competition from degree-granting women's colleges, Mount Holyoke successfully petitioned the state legislature for a charter change that was granted on March 8, 1888. At that time, the name of the school changed to Mount Holyoke Seminary and College and the first degrees were awarded on June 27, 1889. The Seminary Program that did not lead to a degree was phased out and another change to the charter granted on January 31, 1893 marked the institution's transformation into Mount Holyoke College.</p><citation>From the guide to the Origins and Governance Collection RG 2., 1834-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>The Mount Holyoke College War Collection brings together a wide range of materials that show how students, faculty, administrators, and alumnae of the College responded to various wars from the United States Civil War (1861-1865) to the Iraq War (2003-present). Most of the collection consists of records created by College departments, offices, and committees, including the Office of the President, the Appointment Bureau, the News Bureau, the Public Relations Office, and the Alumnae Association. The collection also includes newspaper articles, records of local, national, and international war-related committees, and materials received from alumnae and other donors.</p><citation>From the guide to the Mount Holyoke College War Collection RG 30., 1860-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>The first administrator and teacher at Mount Holyoke was Mary Lyon, the founder of the school who was Principal from 1837 until her death in 1849 as well as a teacher in chemistry classes. Initially, she hired Eunice Caldwell as Associate Principal with Amanda A. Hodgman and Mary W. Smith as additional teachers. Lyon also relied on founding members of Mount Holyoke's Board of Trustees to assist her with managing the institution's finances and supervising the construction, furnishing, and maintenance of the Seminary Building where students and teachers lived and worked. She soon began hiring Mount Holyoke graduates as teachers at the school, a practice that continued for much of the nineteenth century. Teachers usually taught a variety of subjects and often supervised the domestic work system Lyon established whereby students did most of the cooking, cleaning, and laundry at the school (thus keeping the tuition rate low by eliminating the need for a paid staff). Men were hired to perform heavy manual labor and a Steward was responsible for the overall maintenance and upkeep of buildings and grounds. Trustees continued to act as Treasurers of Mount Holyoke until the early twentieth century. Other early staff members included a librarian (Mary O. Nutting, Class of 1852) and the Director of the Observatory (Elisabeth Bardwell, Class of 1866).</p><p>Teachers began specializing in particular subjects in the late 1880s. Elizabeth Mead, President of Mount Holyoke from 1890-1900, required teachers to earn a Ph.D. in their respective fields and by 1896 faculty were organized into a formal group which held regular meetings and actively shaped the College's curriculum. The first male teachers, Asa Kinney (botany) and William Churchill Hammond (music), were hired in 1899. When Mount Holyoke began a graduate program in the 1890s, graduate students (including those from countries other than the United States) began working as teaching or laboratory assistants at the College. The first paid sabbaticals were granted to faculty in 1925. Mount Holyoke's faculty has steadily become increasingly diverse in response to changes in the curriculum and the College's affirmative action initiatives.</p><p>The College has created many staff positions to meet the growth and changing needs of the school. For example, the first Registrar, Caroline Boardman Greene (Class of 1889) was appointed in 1893 and Florence Purington (Class of 1886) became the first Dean of the College in 1907. When students began living in separate dormitories after the destruction of the Seminary Building by fire in 1896, house mothers were hired to oversee students' activities in each residence. Maids and other staff were hired in increasing numbers after the domestic work system ended in 1914. Other staff members have been appointed as needed, such as those who support the technological needs of faculty and staff as employees of Library, Information, and Technology Services.</p><citation>From the guide to the Faculty and Staff Biographical Files RG 19., circa 1837-, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary opened on November 8, 1837 with 116 students. The first graduating class of three students received diplomas on August 23, 1838. Initially, homemaking, teaching and missionary work were the only occupations open to alumnae. By the middle of the nineteenth century, however, increasing numbers of alumnae had entered professions such as social work, librarianship, journalism, medicine, and law. Notable alumnae include poet Emily Dickinson; women's rights advocate Lucy Stone; Olympia Brown, the first woman to become a full-time ordained minister; physician and anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar; playwrights Wendy Wasserstein and Suzan-Lori Parks; Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve as a member of the cabinet of a United States President; and Ella Grasso, the first women elected a state governor in her own right (not as the successor of her husband). A number of these women have been honored on United States postage stamps or with induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame. The Alumnae Association of Mount Holyoke College has also recognized the achievements and contributions of alumnae with a variety of awards including the Alumnae Medal of Honor and the Mary Lyon Award.</p><p>Although Mount Holyoke was established as a non-denominational school, most students during the nineteenth century were affiliated with Protestant denominations and the student body was not geographically, racially or ethnically diverse until the mid-twentieth century. The first Native American students, Elinor S. and Mary H. Boudinot (also spelled Boudinott), attended Mount Holyoke in the 1840s and were the daughters of an assimilated Cherokee father. The first known African American student at Mount Holyoke was Hortense Parker, Class of 1883. The first students born outside the United States came to Mount Holyoke from Canada or the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii) in the 1840s. The first student from Japan, Toshi Miyagawa enrolled in 1889 and the first students from China, Chi Nyok Wang and Ysu Tsit Law, graduated in 1916. Latina and Asian American women began attending Mount Holyoke in the 1930s. In 2010, Mount Holyoke enrolled students from 48 states and nearly 70 countries. On average, approximately one in every three undergraduates is an international citizen or an African American, Asian American, Latina, Native American, or multiracial student.</p><citation>From the guide to the Students and Alumnae Profiles and Statistics Collection RG 23., 1882-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary on November 8, 1837 with one hundred and sixteen students. The first graduating class of three students received diplomas on August 23, 1838. During much of the nineteenth century, each entering student took placement examinations to determine her placement in a particular class. Students were initially organized into three classes (Junior, Middle, and Senior) and until the late 1880s all students followed a set curriculum which focused on the mastery of specific textbooks and laboratory work in the sciences. In the fall of 1861, the curriculum expanded to a four-year program with students organized in Junior, Junior Middle, Senior Middle, and Senior classes. These class designations underwent some changes throughout the years until the s terms Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior were adopted in 1890. In the fall of 1989, Freshmen became known as First Year students.</p><p>In response to competition from degree-granting women's colleges established in the 1860s-1870s, Mount Holyoke's administrators petitioned the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a change in the school's charter. A new charter granted on March 8, 1888 changed the name of the institution to Mount Holyoke Seminary and College and allowed the school to award Bachelor's degrees, the first of which were presented at Commencement in 1889. With an additional charter change on January 31, 1893 the name of the school became Mount Holyoke College. From 1889-1902, Mount Holyoke presented Bachelor of Literature and Bachelor of Science degrees as well as Bachelor of Arts degrees. From 1889/1890-1898/1899, students followed a Classical, Literary, or Scientific course of study. There was also a Seminary program from 1888/89-1892/1893 which enabled students who had enrolled before 1888 to receive a diploma for their work. In 1889/1900, students began pursuing major work in specific disciplines and elective courses were introduced into the curriculum.</p><p>Mount Holyoke has also offered a wide variety of other programs for students. The option for pursuing graduate study became available in 1880/1881 when an Advanced Course for Mount Holyoke graduates was first offered and by 1923/1924 a program of graduate study for all qualified women was well-established. A course of study leading to a Master of Arts began in 1893/1894 and expanded in 1935/1936 to include a Master of Arts in Teaching program which was offered through 1975/1976. Helen C. Flint, Class of 1891 received the first M.A. degree awarded by the College in 1895. In 1966/1967, the graduate program was open to men as well as women and in 1968 Thomas Kelley became the first man to receive a degree (Master of Arts in Teaching) from the College. The Frances Perkins Program for women of non-traditional age who wish to complete the requirements for a Bachelor of Arts degree was established in 1980. Other special programs have included those for teachers wishing to improve their mastery of specific disciplines or for students from other countries who are interested in spending time at a college in the United States. Students enrolled in graduate or special programs have often received scholarships or fellowship from the College and worked as teaching assistants, interns, or residence hall staff while pursuing their studies.</p><citation>From the guide to the Alumnae Biographical Files RG 27. 1, RG 27. 2, RG 27. 3., circa 1831-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation><p>In an 1835 pamphlet outlining her plans for Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, Mary Lyon stated that one of the goals of the school would be to cultivate the missionary spirit among its pupils. Soon after the Seminary opened on November 8, 1837 alumnae began serving as missionaries in the United States and in other countries, where they opened and staffed influential schools, brought aid to orphans and others, and supported social reforms to improve the lives of girls and women. Alumnae were affiliated with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), a Congregational Church organization founded in 1810, or with the missionary boards of other Protestant denominations. The first alumna missionary was Charlotte Bailey (1838), who worked with her husband, Aldin Grout, among the Zulus in South Africa. Other notable foreign missionaries during the nineteenth century were Fidelia Fiske (1842, Persia); Lyon's nieces Abigail Moore Burgess (1838, India) and Lucy Lyon Lord (1840, China); Charlotte and Mary Ely (1861, Armenia); Alice Gordon Gulick (1867, Spain); and Mary Otis Preston Spafford (1879, South Africa). Alumnae were also missionaries to the Cherokee and other Native Americans and to former African American slaves. Members of the Mount Holyoke community actively supported this work by raising funds for alumnae missionaries and establishing a number of organizations for students interested in missionary service, including the Student Volunteer Band and the College's chapter of the Young Women's Christian Association. Many missionaries and officials from mission boards also presented lectures and programs at Mount Holyoke.</p><p>The missionary service of alumnae continued in the twentieth century, exemplified by the work of Alice Browne Frame (1900) in China, Charlotte Allen Ward (1903) in Lebanon and Turkey, Ruth Parker White (1917) in India, Katharine Merrill (1917) in Japan, and Leila Childs Edling (1917) in Angola. Elsie Kimball (1909) and numerous other alumnae supported Near East Relief efforts in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia during and after World War I, while Grace Bacon (1918), Florence Brugger (1922), and many other Mount Holyoke women worked for the American Red Cross and other organizations during both world wars. Beginning in the 1960s, Gena Lee Reisner (1964) and other alumnae demonstrated the College's missionary spirit by joining the Peace Corps, Teach for America, and other initiatives designed to bring education and health care to those in need. Mount Holyoke students such as Sandra Nichols Ward (1965) engaged in this work as undergraduates by participating in Operation Crossroads Africa and similar programs.</p><citation>From the guide to the Mount Holyoke College Missionaries Collection RG 29., circa 1841-present, (Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections)</citation></biogHist>",

Seventy-two years later Dr. Terrell's grandson, William Terrell Dawson, died leaving the remainder of his estate as a bequest - in memory of his father Edgar Gilmer Dawson, an 1849 graduate - to support agricultural education at the University.

WorldCat record id: 699513262</citation><p>In February 1784, just after the close of the Revolutionary War, the General Assembly of Georgia earmarked 40,000 acres of land to endow \"a college or seminary of learning.\" The following year, Abraham Baldwin, a lawyer and minister educated at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who had settled in Georgia in 1783, wrote the charter that created the University of Georgia. Reflecting the exuberance of newfound freedom sweeping through the colonies, Baldwin created a populist document that departed sharply from conventional notions about higher education. The charter asserted that an educated citizenry is essential to a free government, that government has a responsibility to see that its citizens receive an education, and that all people - not just the wealthy and privileged - have a right to education. The legislature's approval of the charter on January 27, 1785, made UGA the first university established by a state government and provided the framework for what would become the American system of publicly supported colleges and universities. For the next sixteen years the university existed only on paper, as Georgia's leaders, occupied with the more pressing business of creating a state, used the land designated for a college for other purposes. In 1801 interest in the university revived, and John Milledge, a lawyer and legislator, bought 633 acres along the frontier on the Oconee River and donated the land as a site for the school. Josiah Meigs, another Yale graduate, was appointed president and sole faculty member and in September 1801 taught the first university classes. The first permanent university building, a three-story brick structure, was completed in 1806 and named Franklin College in honor of Benjamin Franklin. It was the only university building until 1821, and for many years the university was commonly known as Franklin College, though its official name was the University of Georgia. As the school grew, a division for classes in the liberal arts and basic sciences emerged and was named the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. The young school struggled financially in its early years, and only the College of Arts and Sciences existed until 1859, when the School of Law was started. Closed for two years during the Civil War (1861-65), the university escaped possible bankruptcy in 1872 when it was designated a land-grant institution under the Morrill Act. This legislation, and later companion laws, formalized the university's public service mission. Schools of pharmacy, forestry, education, business, journalism, and home economics and a graduate school were started in the early twentieth century, and in 1918 women were admitted as regular students. The creation of the University System of Georgia in 1932 brought the university and the state's twenty-five other public colleges together under the centralized administrative control of the Board of Regents and spun off several university branch campuses as separate institutions. The State College of Agriculture and the State Teachers College were merged with the university.

Before arriving at the University of Chicago he led \"the eight year study\" which measured to what degree students absorbed information given to them by their teachers. The study showed that children learned best at their own pace and students best retained information compounded by experience. This program led to national testing for pre-college students.</p><p>When Tyler met with the President of the University of Chicago to recommend methods for testing applicants, the thirty five year old professor held a reputation as a progressive educator who smoked cigars constantly and raced cars against trains. Although University of Chicago president Robert Hutchins believed in classical education, in 1938 he risked hiring Tyler as the Chief Examiner and Director of the Board of Examinations, Professor of Education, and Chair of the Department of Education. Tyler accepted and moved to Chicago with his entire testing staff.</p><p>Tyler became acting Dean of Social Sciences when Dean Robert Redfield took a leave of absence in 1946. Tyler was officially appointed as dean in 1948. He streamlined the committees between the departments and promoted interdisciplinary studies. Additionally, Tyler participated in University life by contributing to the Great Books Program and to the Chicago Roundtable radio discussions. Additionally, Tyler continuously published the results of his work.</p><p>Through the course of his tenure at the University of Chicago his positions included: Chairman, Department of Education, University of Chicago (1938-48); University Examiner, University of Chicago (1938-53); Dean, Division of the Social Sciences, University of Chicago (1948-53); Director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California (1953-67); Acting President, Social Science Research Council (1971-72); Vice President, Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions (1975-78); and President, System Development Foundation (1969-until his death?).</p><p>Additionally, Tyler served as the official Director of the Examinations Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces Institute from 1943-1954 during which the military asked him to administer tests to measure the effectiveness of its training programs.</p><p>In the 1960's, Tyler worked with his colleagues on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, measuring educational achievements around the United States. Tyler advised six U.S. Presidents and assisted in writing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. After leaving the University of Chicago in 1953, Tyler moved to California as the founding director of the Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, funded by the Ford Foundation (1953-1967). Throughout the 1980's Tyler commuted from California to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to teach and advise the Coalition for School Improvement.</p><p>Tyler's style of testing became common and was known as the \"Tyler Rationale\". His methods were initially considered unorthodox because he advocated the involvement of teachers and parents at every level of school reform. Tyler believed that the purpose of education was to teach children how to function as citizens. He stated, \"Carrying on citizenship is the most important reason for public education…As society keeps moving forward, we need to have more and more education to understand problems that are much more complex than those that were dealt with in 1776.\"</p><p>Tyler's wife, Flora V. Tyler passed away before he did. Ralph Tyler suffered from cancer and passed away on February 18, 1994. He was survived by his brother, Keith I. Tyler; his daughters, Helen Parisi and Ann Fathy; and his son, Ralph W. Tyler, Jr.</p><p>Some of his more famous projects included: Director of Evaluation, Eight-Year Study (1934-42); Director, Cooperative Study in General Education (1939-45); Director, Examinations Staff, U.S. Armed Forces Institute (1943-53); Chairman, Exploratory Committee on Assessing the Progress of Education (1964-68); and Senior Consultant, Science Research Associates, Inc. (1967-82).</p><p>He was also a member of a number of associations and throughout the course of his career held broad associations well beyond the University of Chicago including: Member, National Advisory Mental Health Council (1959-63); Chairman, National Commission on Resources for Youth (1964-79); Chairman, National Commission for Cooperative Education (1962-75); Honorary Life Chairman (1975-?); President, National Academy of Education (1965-69); Chairman, Research Advisory Council of the U.S. Office of Education (1967-70); Member, National Science Board, 1962-68; Vice Chairman (1966-68); and Member, National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children (1965-72)</p><p>Some of his notable publications were: Constructing Achievement Tests (1934); Appraising and Recording Student Progress, with E.R. Smith (1942); Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction (1949); Educational Evaluation; New Roles, New Means, editor (1969); Crucial Issues in Testing, with R. Wolf (1974); Perspectives on American Education (1976); \"Changing Concepts of Educational Evaluation.\" [Monograph] International Journal of Educational Research 10 (1986).</p><citation>From the guide to the Tyler, Ralph W.

He has been called America's \"poet laureate of radio.\" On May 8, 1945, his one-hour live broadcast on the occasion of the end of World War II, On A Note of Triumph, drew 60 million listeners; poet Carl Sandburg praised it as \"one of the all-time great American poems.\"</p><p>Corwin is also the author of several books, including Holes In A Stained Glass Window (1978) and Trivializing America (1983), and his script for the movie Lust For Life (1957) was nominated for an Oscar. His television credits include his 1971 series \"Norman Corwin Presents.\" In the 1990s he began a new series of radio program for National Public Radio, whose casts have included William Shatner, Jack Lemmon, Charles Kuralt, Martin Landau, Hume Cronyn, and Charles Durning.</p><p>As of 2008 Corwin was still very active in his field, writing a monthly column on media, chairing two award committees for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, and serving as a Writer in Residence at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication.</p><p>Corwin was recognized many times over his career for his achievements; his awards include a Peabody (1941, the first year they were awarded), the One World Award (1946), a duPont-Columbia Award, and an Honorary Doctorate from Lincoln College (1990). He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1993, and in 2006 a documentary film on his life ( A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin ) won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Feature).</p><p>\"I have no apology to make for the affirmative tone of these scripts.

As an influential daily columnist, he broke the code of silence on the subject of segregation, chastising a generation of demagogues, timid journalists, and ministers who feared change. When the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in 1954 and southern demagogues led defiance of the court, segregationists vilified McGill as a traitor to his region for urging white southerners to accept the end of segregation.

Shaw's mother worked along side the selfless Melnea Cass. Shaw attended William P. Boardman Elementary School and Henry Lee Higginson Elementary School, was a Girl Scout, and was active at St. Mark's Social Center. A student at Girls Latin School, Shaw was involved with the NAACP Youth Movement; graduating in 1952, Shaw enrolled at Boston University, but left school in 1955 to get married.</p><p>Increasingly involved in community activities, Shaw worked with St. Mark's Social Center and as a member of the Boston Action Group (BAG). Shaw joined other activists like Otto P. and Muriel S. Snowden in 1957; national Student Movement head, Bill Strickland then asked her to head the Boston Northern Student Movement where she coordinated student led voter education, high school tutoring, and economic housing education with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), BAG, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the Unitarians. In 1968, Shaw became involved with Ray Richardson's<span>Say Brother</span>public affairs show on WBEZ-TV; she would go on to appear on the program more than twenty times. In 1969, Shaw was hired by WBZ-TV 4 as Boston's first African American reporter; she remained a news reporter at WBZ TV 4 for more than thirty years. As a civil rights organizer and human services advocate, Shaw demonstrated a rare ability to unite Boston residents and tackle big picture issues. At WBZ, Shaw anchored another black oriented public affairs program,<span>Mzizi Roots</span>.</p><p>Shaw, who helped define minority affairs programming and news content, received numerous journalistic awards for her work, including an award from the Boston Radio-Television News Directors Association, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Association of Black Journalists in 1998, and the Yankee Quill Award from the New England Society of Newspaper Editors. Shaw also volunteered for Boston Partners in Education; served as a board member of Boston Neighborhood Network; and served as the President for both the Boston Coalition of Black Women, and the League of Women for Community Service.</p><citation>From The HistoryMakers™ biography: https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/A2007.067</citation></biogHist>",

(Wyoming State Archives). WorldCat record id: 71013081</citation><p>Jack R. Gage was born on January 13, 1899, in McCook, Nebraska, to Will Vernon and LaVaughn Gage. His father was a physician for the railroad in Wyoming, and they were living in a boxcar at the time of Jack's birth. To avoid giving birth in a boxcar his mother LaVaughn went home to Nebraska. The family settled in Worland, Wyoming, in 1905, where Jack Gage would grow up the only child of Will and LaVaughn. He graduated from Worland High School in 1918. After graduation he enlisted in the United States Army and served in Artillery during World War I. He was honorably discharged in 1919 and went on to complete his education at the University of Wyoming. He graduated in 1924 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Agriculture. While in College he met his wife Leona Switzer from Gillette, Wyoming. They were married September 29, 1922. They had two children, Jack R. Gage Jr., born in 1926, and Richard (Dick) C. Gage, born in 1928.</p><p>Jack R. Gage was a Vocational Agriculture teacher from 1924-1925 at the Cambell County High School in Gillette, Wyoming. From 1929-1934 he was a Geology and Biology teacher at Sheridan High School in Sheridan, Wyoming. In 1934 he quit teaching at Sheridan High School in order to run for Wyoming State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He won the election and served a term of four years, but he failed to get reelected in 1938. There are claims that this position made him the first graduate of the University of Wyoming to hold a state office. In 1941 he was appointed Postmaster in Sheridan, Wyoming. He worked there for seventeen years until 1958. During this time he became involved in Rotary and was the District Governor from 1956-1957. He also wrote the historical novel \"Tensleep and No Rest\" and won the Crusade for Freedom award for a peace plan he had submitted. For three weeks in June of 1957 he went to Russia, and he would later give talks about his visit. In 1958 he resigned as the Sheridan Postmaster in order to run for Secretary of State on the Democratic ticket.</p><p>He won the election in 1958 and served as Wyoming Secretary of State until 1961. In 1960, after Wyoming Senator Keith Thomson died, Governor Joe Hickey was appointed to replace Thomson in the Senate. On January 2, 1961, Joe Hickey resigned as governor in order to take the new appointment. That same day Jack Gage became the Acting Governor of Wyoming until January 7, 1963, when his term expired. Jack Gage ran for Governor in 1962. He won in the primary, beating William \"Scotty\" Jack, but lost in the general election to Cliff Hansen. After 1963 Jack Gage became a well known speaker and was invited to speak at many functions. He also was a published author of historical novels and articles on Wyoming and the West, such as \" The Geography of Wyoming,\" \"Tensleep and No Rest,\" and \" The Horse, The Buggy, The Doctor.\" Jack Gage died of cancer on March 14, 1970, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, at the age of 71.</p><citation>From the guide to the Jack R.

He was educated at Bristol grammar school and Jesus College, Oxford, where as an undergraduate he published his first catalogue of books, thus establishing his reputation as a lover of fine printing and illustrated books. In 1926 Cleverdon opened a bookshop in Charlotte Street, Bristol, and also began publishing, with a limited edition of Eric Gill's 'Art and love' appearing in 1927, and an edition of Coleridge's 'The rime of the ancient mariner' with 10 engravings on copper by David Jones appearing in 1929. The Great Depression brought an end to Cleverdon's publishing venture, but he continued to sell books until the end of the 1930s when he began working part-time for the BBC. In 1939 he became a west regional features producer, and in 1943 a features producer in London. Shortly before the Second World War Cleverdon met Elinor Nest Lewis, daughter of James Abraham Lewis, canon, of Cardiff, Wales. They wed in 1944, and during the course of their marriage had two daughters and three sons. Dec. 1942 saw the first broacast of 'The brains trust', an informational radio program which he created with Howard Thomas. It reached an audience of twelve million, which was at that time about 29% of the population of the United Kingdom. After a brief stint in 1945 as a BBC war correspondent in Burma, he began developing a series of radio portraits for the Third Programme. He dramatized David Jones's In Parenthesis (1948) and The Anathemata (1953), broadcast the poems of John Betjeman, Thom Gunn, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, Siegfried Sassoon, Stevie Smith and Wole Soyinka, and produced the work of Jacob Bronowski, David Garnett, Rose Macaulay, and Compton Mackenzie. In addition to producing programs of folk song with A. L. Lloyd and Alan Lomax, Cleverdon commissioned new music from Lennox Berkeley, Peter Racine Fricker, Alan Rawsthorne, Humphrey Searle, Mátyás Seiber and Aleksandr Tcherepnin. His most famous commission was Dylan Thomas's 'Under milk wood', first broadcast in 1954 with an all Welsh cast and starring Richard Burton. After retiring from the BBC in 1969, Cleverdon returned to publishing. Among the publications of his Clover Hill Editions were works of Michael Ayrton, David Jones, and Reynolds Stone. Douglas Cleverdon died on Oct. 1, 1987 at his home in London.</p><citation>From the description of The Cleverdon-Jones collection, 1972. (Georgetown University).

Schwarzwalder papers, 1935-1992, and undated (bulk 1965-1986). (University of Maryland Libraries). WorldCat record id: 33468555</citation><p>John C. Schwarzwalder, a pioneer in the field of educational television, was born in Columbus, Ohio, on June 21, 1917, to S. J. and Alice Schwarzwalder. He received a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Ohio State University in 1937; a Master's Degree from the University of Michigan in 1940; and a Doctor of Education Degree from the University of Houston in 1953. His master's thesis was entitled \"The Scenic, Dramatic and Musical Ramifications of the Court Masque in Stuart England,\" and his doctoral dissertation was \"An Historical Study of the Technical, Legal and Financial Development of Television.\" On July 10, 1945, Schwarzwalder married Ruth Dierker. They subsequently had two children, Joan Dierdre and Raymond John.</p><p>Schwarzwalder began his military career in 1941 as a private in the United States Army. During his years of military service, he rose to the rank of major. He spent thirty-five months in overseas service in North Africa, Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany. Also involved in combat intelligence and counterintelligence work, Schwarzwalder earned eight campaign stars and was awarded the Medal of Order of Ouissam Alaouite (Morocco). He was a member of the Military Reserve from 1945-1956 with the rank of Major, Military Intelligence. He later wrote about his war experience in We Caught Spies (Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce, 1946).</p><p>From 1945 to 1948, Schwarzwalder served as Associate Director of the Wall School of Music, a private school of nearly 300 students, in Los Angeles. Concurrently, he directed the American GI Chorus in motion picture work for Republic Studios and in concert.</p><p>In 1948 Schwarzwalder moved to Houston, Texas, to become Assistant Professor at the University of Houston. In the course of time he was named Associate Professor and then Professor and Chairman of the Radio-Television Department. It was here in 1950 that Schwarzwalder established KUHF-FM and in 1953, KUHT -TV, the first of the nation's 258 non-commercial, educational television stations. He administered the Department of Radio and Television with a faculty and staff of 43 and 470 students. At KUHT-TV, he developed and produced most of the programs during its first year. Concurrently, he served as news analyst and newscaster for KTRH-AM-FM (CBS).</p><p>In 1956 he left the University of Houston and moved north to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he became Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Twin City Area Educational Television Corporation which owned and operated three non-commercial educational television stations in Minnesota: KTCA -TV and KTCI-TV in Saint Paul/Minneapolis and KWOM-TV in Appleton. None of these stations existed in 1956 when Schwarzwalder arrived. His job included obtaining capital financing, applying for the necessary FCC licenses, supervising construction, arranging for operating funds, finding and hiring adequate operating personnel, setting up programming policies and putting the stations on the air. He later was responsible for arranging for the operation of Midwestern Educational Television, a regional network of 17 stations.</p><p>Leaving Minneapolis to move south again in 1976, Schwarzwalder became the Station Manager of KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Retaining many of his contacts with the Twin City area, he worked as a researcher for Twin City Area PTV Corporation. As a researcher, he completed and submitted bench-mark studies of the implications for PTV of the videodisc and the increasing use and popularity of credit courses.</p><p>In 1978 he was both Executive Consultant to the Twin City Area PTV Corporation and Manager of the Denton, Texas, Channel Two Foundation, Inc. He prepared financial, programming and fund-raising plans for activation of a new station on Channel Two in North Texas, as well as acquiring land for transmitter sites, negotiating with FAA and Department of Defense (Corps of Engineers) and preparing FCC applications.</p><p>From 1977 to 1985 Schwarzwalder was President of DBLS, Inc., a non-profit corporation formed to establish, operate, and maintain non-profit educational television and radio stations in Austin, Texas. At DBLS, Schwarzwalder made applications for television and radio channels to Federal agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and to federal, state, and local government agencies as well as to private individuals, corporations, and foundations for funds and facilities.</p><p>Over the years, Schwarzwalder served as an independent consultant for the states of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Northern Iowa, the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, and the cities of Cleveland, Ohio; Duluth, Minnesota; Fargo, North Dakota; and Little Rock, Arkansas. He also served as a consultant to the University of Maine, the South Carolina ETV Commission, the Alabama ETV Commission, Auburn University, the Louisiana ETV Commission, the Texas ETV Commission, KETC-TV in St. Louis, Missouri, the University of Florida, the Kentucky ETV Commission, the University of Louisville, Milwaukee Technical College, Superior State University (Wisconsin), the State of North Dakota and Lakehead University (Ontario, Canada).</p><p>Always active in whatever community of which he was a part, Schwarzwalder chaired the Committee on Racial Imbalance in St. Paul Public Schools (CRISP) in 1965. He was also a member of the Afro-American Music Opportunities Association from 1968 to 1976. Other organizations which benefited from his time and talents were: American Heart Association; Minnesota Heart Association; Minnesota Metropolitan Planning Commission; Minnesota Planning Association; Minneapolis Citizens League; Minnesota Orchestral Association; School for Societal Development; Minnesota Humanities Commission; and Advisory Committee on Mass Media, Texas Humanities Commission.</p><p>John C.

Bennett Papers, 1903-2001 (bulk: 1949-1992) (University of Florida). WorldCat record id: 19617386</citation><p>Charles \"Charlie\" Edward Bennett was born on December 2, 1910 in Canton, New York. At the age of two his family relocated to Tampa, Florida, where his father worked for the U.S. Weather Bureau. Charles lived in Tampa throughout his youth. He was an Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts of America and received the Eagle Scout Award. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Florida. He was president of the UF student body and served as editor of the Florida Alligator student newspaper. In addition to a wide range of volunteer activities and participation in political organizations, Charles worked his way through college by waiting tables, working on a university farm, and writing articles for local newspapers.</p><p>After graduating from UF with a Juris Doctor law degree in 1934, Bennett began practicing law in Jacksonville, Florida. In 1941, Bennett was elected to a term in the Florida State legislature. In early 1942 he gave up his legislative seat and joined the U.S. Army as a private. Bennett served in the Pacific during World War II, including fighting in the Philippines and New Guinea. While serving in the Philippines, he contracted polio, a disease that left his legs partially paralyzed for the remainder of his life. When Bennett left Army service in 1947 he had attained the rank of Captain. He was awarded both a Bonze and Sliver Star for his outstanding wartime accomplishments.</p><p>Following the war, Bennett returned to Jacksonville and resumed practicing law. In 1949 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as the Democratic representative of Jacksonville's 2nd district (which became the 3rd district in 1967). He was re-elected twenty-one more times, serving from 1949 to 1993, and he rarely faced strong opposition. In 1953, Bennett married Dorothy Jean, with whom he had four children: Lucinda (Cindy), Charles Jr., James, and Bruce. Throughout his life, Bennett was devoted to his Christian faith; he was a deacon and taught Sunday school for many years at the Riverside Avenue Christian Church in Jacksonville. In 1955 he sponsored the legislation which added the phrase \"In God We Trust\" to American currency. Later in his life Bennett revealed that he believed this was his most important accomplishment as a Congressman.</p><p>Throughout his political career Bennett fought against corruption in legislature, promoting a code of ethics for members of government that came to be called \"The Ten Commandments.\" His strict adherence to a high standard of personal ethics resulted in his nicknames such as \"Mr. Ethics\" and \"Mr. Clean.\" He led efforts to establish the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1958, and the \"Code of Ethics for Government Service.\" He also was the first chair of the Congressional Ethics Committee. Fiscally conservative and a great opponent of waste, Bennett's leftover campaign funds were donated to the National Parks Service, and he regularly returned his veteran disability pension to the U.S. Treasury. Bennett also refused his congressional pay raises and voted against the practice in Congress. He received the \"Watchdog of the Treasury Award\" on multiple occasions for his strong support of economy in government.</p><p>During the 1950s and 1960s, Bennett voted with many southern Democrats against civil rights and Great Society programs, including Medicare and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He also signed the so-called Southern Manifesto in 1956, generally opposing the integration of public schools. However, in 1965 Bennett broke with the southern bloc to support the 1965 Voting Rights Act, arguing that it was based on a \"constitutional obligation.\" Throughout his later political career he consistently received a great deal of support from Jacksonville's African-American community.</p><p>Bennett was very concerned with the nation's defense and security, and for many years was second in seniority on the House Armed Services Committee. Bennett strongly opposed worldwide proliferation of nuclear arms, and in the 1960s he supported the creation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In the 1980s, he supported funding for more conventional weapons and reductions in Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) spending. His legislation also set standards for upgrades in military housing, particularly in his own district's naval air stations.</p><p>Domestically, Bennett was concerned with urban issues of poverty, juvenile delinquency and drug use, and the raising of auto safety standards. He also advocated better working conditions for migrant farm workers, increased awareness for animal rights, establishment of the National Teachers Corps, federal aid to hospital and school construction, child welfare programs, and establishment of the Small Business Administration. As a disabled person Bennett promoted the rights of handicapped individuals. He co-sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, fought for architectural improvements to aid the handicapped, and regularly sought to demonstrate the often underestimated capacity of disabled persons. Despite his paralysis, he acquired the longest consecutive record of roll call votes in Congress without an absence - 26 years.</p><p>Bennett also was a historian of Florida and U.S. colonial history, writing and publishing nine books and several articles. He was a proponent of environmental conservation and historical preservation. He often sponsored bills to preserve or improve Florida's environment, including the prevention of erosion on Florida's beaches. He was instrumental in the creation of the Fort Caroline National Park Memorial in Jacksonville and its surrounding Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, as well as the Key Deer Preserve in the Florida Keys. He also was co-sponsor of the Wilderness Preservation Act and the Land and Water Conservation Act.</p><p>In 1993, Bennett retired from Congress to care for his ailing wife. He suffered a heart attack and a stroke in 2002. He died on September 6, 2003 in Jacksonville at age 92 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</p><citation>From the guide to the Charles E.

Then known as Four College Radio (Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst), WFCR initially operated on a very limited schedule, broadcasting only from noon to midnight, six days per week, and it offered little in the way of locally-produced content. After joining the Eastern Educational Radio Network in 1962, however, WFCR began gradually to expand its scope, increasing its on-air presence to seventeen hours per day within two years and pursuing a more ambitious agenda of covering cultural events in the region. By the late 1960s, WFCR became a major public venue for the myriad musical productions originating in the Pioneer Valley region, as well as for local writers, artists, and the steady stream of visiting lecturers at the Four Colleges.</p><p>With Hampshire College joining the Four Colleges in 1966 -- thus creating Five College Radio -- WFCR hired its first Music Director. UMass assumed the license for the station in 1967, the same year that Congress established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and relocated the studio from Springfield to Hampshire House on the UMass campus. The station's community affairs programming began in earnest shortly thereafter with the appearance of Que Tal Amigos, a Spanish-language program aimed at migrant workers in the Pioneer Valley, and soon included programming tailored to women (the Women's Hour), French Americans, and African Americans, among others.</p><p>In 1997, WFCR began to offer a 24/7 schedule and offers a full line-up of news and talk programming offered to the region through WNNZ at 640AM and 91.7FM, and streamed through internet at nepr.net . The station's mix of classical and jazz music, news, and entertainment reached over 175,000 listeners per week in 2012.</p><citation>From the guide to the WFCR Radio Broadcast Collection MS 741., 1954-1987, (Special Collections and University Archives, University of Massachusetts Amherst Libraries)</citation></biogHist>",

His humorous approach to social issues won him a wide readership, and helped him to operate a pro-civil rights publication in the American South.

Between 1921 and 1929, he worked various jobs in New York and became a stockbroker. In 1929, Golden's brokerage firm declared bankruptcy and he was convicted for mail fraud and sentenced to five years in the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta.

Scott Fletcher papers, 1926-1991 and undated (bulk 1944-1971). (University of Maryland Libraries). WorldCat record id: 38868060</citation><p>Non-commercial, educational television pioneer, C. (Cyril) Scott Fletcher, was born July 28, 1904 in Sydney, Australia to Michael Scott and Winifred Sarah Fletcher. He attended Newington College in Sydney, Australia from 1916 to 1918 and then the University of Sydney, from 1919 to 1922. At Sydney University C. Scott Fletcher received a diploma in Economics and Commerce.</p><p>During his enrollment at Sydney University, Fletcher joined Cayce-Paul Motors Limited, the Studebaker distributor in New South Wales, Australia. There he worked as a mechanic in the works and assembly plant. Fletcher eventually joined the Studebaker Corporation of Australasia Limited. At Studebaker, he worked his way up the corporate ladder and served in a variety of managerial positions at various international sites including: China, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States and Rhodesia. He eventually became the international vice-president of Studebaker, just prior to World War II. At Studebaker, Fletcher was able to learn the automobile industry, travel the globe and befriend the president of Studebaker, Paul Hoffman.</p><p>It was Paul Hoffman who requested Fletcher be given leave from Studebaker to join United China Relief Inc. There, he became the Executive Vice Chairman of United China Relief Inc., in 1942, and helped raise over 7 million dollars for the Chinese allies of the United States.</p><p>In the year 1942, Fletcher also joined the Committee for Economic Development (CED), in Washington D.C., and served as its Field Director from 1942 to 1943. In New York from 1943 to 1946 Fletcher served as the Executive Director of the Committee and from 1947 to 1952 he was a trustee. The goal of the Committee for Economic Development was to facilitate a quick transition from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. The aims of the Committee were to stimulate economic development and provide jobs. These goals were reached under the leadership of C. Scott Fletcher until his resignation in 1946 from both the Committee for Economic Development and also the Studebaker Corporation. In 1946 Fletcher was appointed as a trustee to CED, a position which he held until he was asked to join the Ford Foundation in 1951.</p><p>While a trustee at the Committee for Economic Development, Fletcher was asked by William Benton, Publisher of Encyclopedia Britannica, to become the President of Encyclopedia Britannica Films Inc., Chicago, Illinois. With Encyclopedia Britannica Films, he oversaw the creation of films and filmstrips for classroom purposes. This marked the beginning of C. Scott Fletcher's career in education.</p><p>C. Scott Fletcher remained President of Encyclopedia Britannica Films from 1946 to 1951. In late 1950, William Benton, vice-chairman of the Committee for Economic Development, talked with Paul Hoffman who had become the director of the Ford Foundation, about convincing C. Scott Fletcher to become president of an unnamed Fund. This fund was to be established through the Ford Foundation and with its focus on adult education. The unnamed fund in May of 1951 became the Fund for Adult Education. In January of 1951 C. Scott Fletcher joined the Ford Foundation, having resigned from Encyclopedia Britannica Films, and became president of the Fund for Adult Education. It was as president of the Fund for Adult Education that C. Scott Fletcher began his work in the field of non-commercial educational television .</p><p>C. Scott Fletcher, during his ten years with the Fund for Adult Education, helped establish and fund the first thirty non-commercial television stations in the United States. He was instrumental in garnering support from civic and business leaders, government officials, educators and citizens for the establishment of ETV (educational television) stations across the country. He also helped to fund the first National Educational Television and Radio Program Center in 1954, which marked the beginning of the national program service. Under Fletcher's leadership, the Ford Foundation's Fund For Adult Education provided more than $11,000,000 for the advancement of educational television over a ten-year period. During his ten years at the Fund for Adult Education, 1951-1961, Fletcher remained a loyal advocate of non-commercial television as an educational vehicle.</p><p>Eventually the Fund for Adult Education was reabsorbed by its parent, the Ford Foundation. Fletcher decided to retire from the field of education and educational television and establish his own management and communications consulting business in 1961, which he maintained until 1972.</p><p>In 1964 Fletcher returned from retirement to become the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Educational Television Stations (ETS), a division of the National Association for Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) . ETS, under Fletcher, was responsible for the founding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) . CPB was signed into existence by President Lyndon B. Johnson, November 7, 1967, after the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 . The efforts of C.Scott Fletcher combined with those of ETS, NAEB, and the Carnegie Commission, were influential forces that enabled the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Fletcher served as a Chief Liaison Officer between ETS and NAEB from 1967-1971 and then in 1971 he retired from the field for a second time.</p><p>After his final retirement, C. Scott Fletcher remained active in many causes such as the \"save the beaches\" campaign in his hometown in Florida. Throughout his later years he maintained constant correspondence with congressmen and businessmen, stating his opinions and sharing his stories.</p><p>C. Scott Fletcher died in Pasadena, California, March 17, 1991.</p><citation>From the guide to the C.

He then took a job as Deputy Director of Radio Free Asia from 1951 to 1953.</p><p>Immediately after leaving Radio Free Asia, Day received a phone call from the assistant to the president of Stanford University asking if he would be interested in applying for a job that was being developed by the Bay Area Public Television Association. Day was interested and about a week later, he became the founding director of KQED, San Francisco, the nation's sixth public television station.</p><p>Day served as the president and general manager of KQED from 1953 until 1969. Under his leadership, KQED won a worldwide reputation for its imaginative and bold programming and for its innovative fund raising. KQED set a new precedence for nightly news with its program Newsroom .</p><p>For fourteen years, Day hosted his own weekly program, Kaleidoscope, on which he interviewed many notable people including Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert Kennedy, Buster Keaton, Aldous Huxley, and Alexander Kerensky. Additionally, he conducted extended interviews with Eric Hoffer and Arnold Toynbee.</p><p>In 1969, Day left KQED to become president of National Educational Television (NET), then the national network of educational television with headquarters in New York City.

His name is closely associated with some of the NET programming of that period, including The Great American Dream Machine, An American Family, Banks and the Poor, and VD Blues .</p><p>In 1973, Day resigned as president of WNET due to his dissatisfaction with public television and the growing importance of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) . He founded his own production company, Publivision, Inc., which produced and syndicated to public stations all over the world a night interview program, Day At Night . The series of 130 half-hour shows brought Day together with many leaders in the arts, sciences, literature, sports, entertainment, and public service, such as Ray Bradbury, Aaron Copland, Alger Hiss, Muhammad Ali, Jason Robards, and Ralph Ellison.</p><p>Day's service with public television continued even after he had left for the private sector. He served three years on the original board of PBS and fourteen years on the original board of the Children's Television Workshop . He was one of the founders of the International Public Television Screening conference, chairman of the board of The Press and the Public Project, and president of Timely Productions.</p><p>In 1995, Day published the book, The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television, which outlines the history of public television from the early 1950s, through the turbulent sixties and seventies, to the modern problems that face the field in the 1990s.</p><p>Starting in 1976, Day served as Professor Emeritus at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in television and radio.

Lillian Eugenia Smith was born into a large, respectable, prosperous family in Jasper, Florida, on December 12, 1897. When the family business collapsed in 1915, her family moved to their cottage in Clayton, in Rabun County, and started Laurel Falls Girls Camp. Smith studied at Piedmont College in Demorest (1915-16) and then left to help run the family camp. Pursuing her great love of music, she also did two stints at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland (1917, 1919).

From as early as the 1930s, she argued that Jim Crow was evil (\"Segregation is spiritual lynching,\" she said) and that it leads to social and moral retardation. Smith gained national recognition - and regional denunciation - by writing Strange Fruit (1944), a bold novel of illicit interracial love. Five years later she hurled another thunderbolt against racism in Killers of the Dream (1949), a brilliant psychological and autobiographical work warning that segregation corrupted the soul; removed any possibility of freedom and decency in the South; and had serious implications for women and children in particular in their developing views of sex, their bodies, and their innermost selves. From her home in Clayton, atop Old Screamer Mountain, she openly convened interracial meetings, and she toured the South, talking to people from all races and classes. She was unsparing in her criticisms of \"liberals\" and \"moderates\" like Atlanta's famed Ralph McGill and refused to join groups such as the Southern Regional Council until it could oppose segregation as well as racism. In her own psyche she struggled with intensely conflicting desires: to write creatively, following her heart's passions, or to respond to her stern conscience and the intellectual voice of duty.

From 1942-1972 he was editor of the Saturday Review. Following his appointment as executive editor in 1940, he introduced essays that drew a connection between literature and current events, whereupon circulation of the magazine increased 50 percent. Unafraid to criticize, Cousins was outspoken and his articles sometimes bitter. At times he criticized the U.S. government, but he felt strongly that a unique potential for greatness existed in America; he wrote The Good Inheritance: the Democratic Chance (1942) to explore this idea. Cousins felt that modern problems stemmed from the absence of a collective voice and from Americans' inability to see their social and political dilemmas clearly. In 1972 Cousins left the Saturday Review but returned the following year. In 1980 he was named \"editor emeritus.\" In his final years he was adjunct professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral science at the University of California at Los Angeles.

It specializes in communications cases, especially the commercial evolution of television, and is located in Washington, D.C. Clients of Cohn and Marks have included the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) and radio and television stations owned by Lady Bird Johnson.\n\nIn 1955 Leonard Marks, who was at that time NAEB general counsel, encouraged the association to seek federal funds for the construction of educational television facilities. Assisted by Senators Lyndon B. Johnson and Warren Magnuson, the legislation was introduced into the 85th, 86th and 87th Congresses. Enacted into law in 1962, the Educational Television Facilities Act provided matching funds to states for non-commercial television stations. <citation> From the combined records of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), held by the University of Maryland and the Wisconsin Historical Society, and compiled as part of the Unlocking the Airwaves project (unlockingtheairwaves.org).</citation>\n\n</p>",

Began broadcasting 15 April 1949.</p><citation>From the guide to the Pacifica Foundation Publicity brochures and papers, 1949-1984, (Stanford University. Libraries. Dept. of Special Collections and University Archives.)</citation><p>In March of 1946, Lewis Hill, Eleanor McKinney and others began discussing the need for non-commercial, educational, cultural radio in the San Francisco Bay area. Frustrated with commercial radio, which they perceived as narrow in scope and rushed in delivery, Lewis Hill and this small group of people founded the Pacifica Foundation. Nearly three years after its incorporation date, Pacifica's first station, Berkeley's KPFA, went on the air.</p><p>From the station's beginning audience support was quite strong. Volunteers and donations arrived very soon after KPFA began airing, although more volunteers and more money were always needed. Pacifica was granted tax exemption on the basis of being an educational institution, and this also helped with the problems inherent in raising funds from listeners.</p><p>As Pacifica's first station, KPFA was the first listener-supported radio enterprise. The goal behind this revolutionary ideas was to serve as a grass roots forum; to support diversity, freedom of speech, to be funded by listeners and to program according to their interests and needs, not those of a corporate sponsor. These ideals were supported by the programming style at Pacifica. Examples of this practice were allowing programs to be as long or short as would be appropriate for the subject (not cutting them off to fit into tight commercial schedules), using informal speech style in order to avoid any alienation associated with more formal speech, etc.</p><p>Much of this idealism that was so identified with Pacifica was a result of the influence of Lewis Hill, the prime mover of the organization. Hill was a pacifist, who above all else, felt that communication, especially via the arts such as music, drama and literature, could form bonds among people. He also considered discussion of science, religion and philosophy ways to form such bonds, and address the quality of the human spirit. Hill believed that open controversy concerning concerning these and other such realms was a natural and necessary part of learning. As a result, Pacifica encouraged the broadcasting of differing points of view. Over the years, this dedication to freedom of expression created conflicts not only with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but with the Senate (1963 investigation concerning suspected Communist infiltration) and the FBI as well. In spite of a series of investigations and many complaints from listeners who were offended by their seeming lack of discrimination in programming, Pacifica stations did not lose their licenses. In fact, they set precedents concerning freedom of speech in broadcasting, from which communication media have benefited since.</p><p>Lewis Hill's vision set the stage for Pacifica and its open door programming policy. His time with the Foundation was not without problems, however. Between 1952 and 1954, KPFA experienced management related problems as a result of the clashing of the founding group's goals and new staff members' ideals. Hill resigned in 1952, and several other workers associated with the station's beginning left in protest of Hill's absence. The new management struggled, and in 1954, Hill returned.</p><p>Hill's suicide in 1954 shocked both KPFA staff and listeners. Because of his central role in creating the essence and style of the station, it was unclear how Pacifica would be affected. Instead of losing sight of Hill's vision, Pacifica began realizing plans to expand into other communities, and four stations have been added: KPFK, Los Angeles, 1959; WBAI, New York, 1960; KPFT, Houston, 1970; and WPFW, Washington, DC, 1977. Many affiliate stations have signed on in addition to these core stations. As with KPFA, each of these core stations has struggled to address its audience thoughtfully. For various reasons, each has also encountered resistance from sections of the community it serves. For example, KPFT was bombed twice in its first years, and other stations have experienced internal disagreements.</p><p>Pacifica has a unique status in broadcasting history not only for being the first listener-supported radio station, but also for breaking ground in freedom of speech issues, and for taking the risk of providing controversial programming and points of view.</p><citation>From the guide to the Pacifica Foundation Records, 1946-1991, 1950-1980, (Mass Media and Culture)</citation></biogHist>",

He attended public schools in Portland, Oregon, then went on to study psychology at the University of Oregon and Stanford University.</p><p>Prior to coming to the University of Michigan Campbell taught at Northwestern University. In addition, he received a postdoctoral fellowship to study in the Department of Anthropology at Cambridge University, then with the coming of war left to spend several months conducting a field study of the black population of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. Early in 1942 he joined Rensis Likert and a staff of social scientists in Washington, D.C., to work providing information to federal agencies on various social and economic problems that had arisen as a result of the war. His title was Assistant Head of the Division of Program Surveys of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics.</p><p>Campbell was one of a group of scholars who came out of the Division of Program Surveys dedicated to establishing a new kind of survey research facility in a university setting. Given encouragement by the University of Michigan, Campbell, Likert and others came to Ann Arbor in 1946 to set up the Survey Research Center, one of the units out of which the Institute for Social Research ultimately evolved. He headed the SRC from 1948 to 1970, at which time he succeeded Rensis Likert as ISR director.</p><p>Campbell was most closely associated with survey research in three areas: political behavior, racial attitudes, and quality of life studies. He directed a long-time study in political elections that began with the presidential election of 1948. For this and later succeeding studies, Campbell became known as a nationally recognized expert in the field of political surveys.</p><p>During the 1960's and at the request of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the Survey Research Center undertook a study of race problems in fifteen major cities. Campbell and Howard Schuman were directors of the study which was undertaken early in 1968. Periodically thereafter, Campbell continued to monitor trends in racial attitudes by repeating parts of the study (usually every two years).</p><p>Campbell's third major interest was finding ways of conceptualizing and measuring the psychological quality of life. He began work in this area in 1968 with support from the Russell Sage Foundation.</p><p>In addition to his responsibilities at ISR, Campbell was Professor of Sociology and Psychology at the University and a lecturer in the Law School. He also served on many University committees.</p><p>Campbell was active in many professional organizations and served as a consultant to government agencies. He was an author and editor, and much in demand as a speaker. He died on December 15,1980 at his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p><citation>From the guide to the Angus Campbell Papers, 1949-1980, (Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)</citation></biogHist>",

    "description": "<biogHist><p><span>Committee History</span></p><p>Education has been an important issue for the state legislature since it's beginning in 1850. The Committee on Public Schools was the first Senate committee that addressed education in California. This committee was created by the first legislature of California on December 21, 1850. In the next session the name was changed to the Committee on Education and it was resolved that any bill relating to education and common schools be referred to this committee.</p><p>When California officially became a state in 1850, the United States government appropriated 500,000 acres of land to be used for the establishment and support of common schools. The Senate Education Committee was called upon to report on the proper apportionment of money derived from the sale of this land. The committee found that any money made by sale of that land should only fund education. In the first decades of statehood, the committee also dealt with fundamental issues that accompanied creating the state school system. This three-member committee addressed the possibility of incorporating into the state school system institutions of higher education that were previously privately run.</p><p>As the realm of education expanded in California, the committee expanded as well. Over the years the committee has averaged 11 members, reaching a high of 14 members in the 1999-2000 legislative session. In 1951 the committee heard bills that amended the education code or were related to the University of California and any uncodified legislation relating to either. By 1970 the committee's scope changed to include bills relating to education, higher education, and educational personnel other than noncertificated state employees. As the population in California grew, so did the need for more funding for public schools. The committee heard bills that dealt with school districts facing bankruptcy, which would have left many children without education. They also dealt with issues regarding aid for incorporating secondary and higher education institutions into the state school system.</p><p>The chairpersons of this committee from 1962 - 2008 were as follows:</p><p>Donnelly, Hugh P. (Dem), 1962-1966</p><p>Rodda, Albert S. (Dem), 1967-1976</p><p>Dunlap, John F. (Dem), 1977-1978</p><p>Carpenter, Paul B. (Dem), 1979-1980</p><p>Sieroty, Alan (Dem), 1981-1982</p><p>Hart, Gary K.

The network is headquartered at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at 10 Universal City Plaza), and Chicago (at the NBC Tower). NBC is one of the Big Three television networks, and is sometimes referred to as the \"Peacock Network\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, introduced in 1956 to promote the company's innovations in early color broadcasting; it became the network's official emblem in 1979.\nFounded in 1926 by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), NBC is the oldest major broadcast network in the United States. At that time, the parent company of RCA was General Electric (GE). In 1932, GE was forced to sell RCA and NBC as a result of antitrust charges. In 1986, control of NBC passed back to General Electric (GE) through its $6.4 billion purchase of RCA. GE immediately began to liquidate RCA's various divisions, but retained NBC. After the acquisition by GE, Bob Wright became chief executive officer of NBC; he would remain in that position until his retirement in 2007, when he was succeeded by Jeff Zucker.\n\nIn 2003, French media company Vivendi merged its entertainment assets with GE, forming NBC Universal. Comcast purchased a controlling interest in the company in 2011, and acquired General Electric's remaining stake in 2013. Following the Comcast merger, Zucker left NBCUniversal and was replaced as CEO by Comcast executive Steve Burke.\n\nNBC has thirteen owned-and-operated stations and nearly 200 affiliates throughout the United States and its territories, some of which are also available in Canada and/or Mexico via pay-television providers or in border areas over the air; NBC also maintains brand licensing agreements for international channels in South Korea and Germany.",

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Thomas Joseph Dodd, the third generation of his family to reside in Connecticut, was born in Norwich on 15 May 1907. During his career he served two terms in the U.S. Senate, and became well known for his work on the Nuremburg Trials where he served as Vice-Chairman of the Review Board and Executive Trial Counsel. After an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 1970, Dodd retired from public life and died in 1971 at the age of 64.</p><citation>From the description of Thomas J. Dodd papers, 1919-1971. (University of Connecticut). WorldCat record id: 75959581</citation><p>Thomas Joseph Dodd, the third generation of his family to reside in Connecticut, was born in Norwich on 15 May 1907. Young Thomas received consistent training in Roman Catholicism, a regimen that significantly shaped his world view as an adult. He attended Norwich public schools and graduated from St. Anselm's Preparatory School in 1926. The future two-term Democratic senator earned a bachelor's degree from Providence College in 1930 and received a law degree from Yale University in 1933. He served as the president of the Yale Democratic Club and led a group of young liberals, the \"Flying Wedge\", to speak on behalf of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal.</p><p>In 1934 Dodd married the former Grace Murphy of Westerly, Rhode Island and the couple proceeded to raise a family of six children: Thomas J., Jr., Carolyn, Jeremy, Martha, Christopher, and Nicholas.</p><p>In the same year U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, another Connecticut native, was so impressed with Dodd's work at Yale that he convinced the young attorney to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Dodd became a Special Agent and participated in the apprehension of such notorious criminals as John Dillinger, \"Babyface\" Nelson, and the Bremer kidnappers.</p><p>In 1935 Dodd was appointed Director of the National Youth Administration for Connecticut, a position future president Lyndon B. Johnson held for Texas . The NYA aimed to create educational and employment opportunities for young people struggling through the Great Depression. Dodd served as a delegate to the 1936 Democratic national convention. His meteoric rise continued in 1938 with entry into the U.S. Justice Department as a Special Assistant to the Attorney General. He played a pivotal role in the creation of the department's first Civil Rights Division. Dodd's more noteworthy cases included prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina and defending labor's right to organize and bargain collectively in Georgia.</p><p>During World War II, Dodd handled cases involving espionage and sabotage that helped cripple Nazi fifth column efforts to destabilize the United States war effort. His work led to the convictions of Reverend Kurt Molzahn, Wilhelm Kunge, Otto Willimanti, and Count Anostase Vonsiatsky on spying charges. Dodd also helped uncover industrial fraud by American firms supplying military hardware, including such New England companies as Anaconda Wire and Cable, Collyer Insulated Wire, Arrow Machine Tool, and Lincoln Machine .</p><p>As the war ended, the Allied Powers prepared to convene a military tribunal to prosecute accused Nazi war criminals. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, the head of the American legal team, requested that Dodd join the jurists assembling at Nuremberg, Germany . Dodd served as Vice-Chairman of the Review Board and Executive Trial Counsel. The latter position rendered Dodd the second ranking U.S. lawyer and s supervisor of the day-to-day management of the U.S. prosecution team. He shaped many of the strategies and policies through which this unprecedented trial took place and frequently dealt with other Allied legal notables such as Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe of Great Britain and Lieutenant General Roman Rudenko of the Soviet Union . Dodd concentrated upon proving the charge of conspiracy to wage aggressive war and consequently cross-examined German industrialists as well as military and political leaders. He reconstructed the will of the last president of the Weimar Republic, Paul von Hindenburg, to reveal that the Nazis had falsified this document to help justify Chancellor Adolph Hitler 's consolidation of power.</p><p>Dodd presented portions of virtually every aspect of the prosecution's case. He developed a degree of notoriety for displaying the shrunken head of a concentration camp inmate during the trial. Some attorneys deemed such behavior grandstanding and they did not appreciate Dodd's flair for the dramatic. As one of the few civilian lawyers among the U.S. prosecutors, Dodd privately expressed an acute self-consciousness of his unique status. He also experienced the intense loneliness common among Nuremberg staffers separated from their families.</p><p>Dodd's Nuremberg work enhanced his stature and visibility back in the United States . He received a Presidential Citation, the U.S. Medal of Freedom, and the Czechoslovakian Order of the White Lion for his outstanding efforts. In 1949 the Polish government, then dominated by Moscow, offered him a prestigious award for service at Nuremberg. Dodd responded with a scathing, public denunciation of Communism in which he refused to accept honors from a regime that he perceived as barely distinct from National Socialism.</p><p>Upon his return to America in 1946, Dodd began the private practice of law in Hartford and entered Connecticut politics. He sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1948 against a better-known candidate, Chester Bowles, without ever formally announcing his candidacy. Democratic State Chairman John M. Bailey threw his support behind the more liberal Bowles for fear that the potential third party presidential bid of Henry Wallace would splinter Democrats through the People's Party in Connecticut. Bailey then began a \"Draft Dodd\" movement for lieutenant governor, but Dodd refused to join what he perceived as a sellout to Communist sympathizers. He focused instead upon civic, charity, and service work. In 1950 Dodd returned to public life to campaign vigorously on behalf of Connecticut Senator Brien McMahon against Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy 's efforts to unseat him. Despite his ardent anticommunism, Dodd resisted the overly zealous red-baiting of the Cold War. McMahon triumphed in the ensuing election and Democrats encouraged Dodd to pursue a political career.</p><p>Dodd won election to Congress from the First Congressional District in 1952 and was reelected two years later. He was the only Connecticut Democrat to sit in the U.S. House during this period. Dodd served on the Government Operations and Foreign Affairs Committees, as well as the Select Committee to Investigate Communist Aggression. After unsuccessfully running for the U.S. Senate in 1956 against Republican incumbent Prescott Bush, Dodd ran again and defeated Republican William A. Purtell in 1958. Earlier that year he had received the Commander of the Order of Merit award from the President of Italy for counsel provided to help prevent a Communist seizure of power.</p><p>Dodd served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-chaired its Internal Security Subcommittee. He sat on the Judiciary Committee and chaired its Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee. A brief tenure on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee completed Dodd's legislative assignments.</p><p>Dodd championed a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's gun control legislation long before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy with a mail-order rifle. He eventually secured passage of a firearms bill in 1968, legislation that fell far short of his initial expectations. He ardently supported the civil rights legislation of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, particularly with respect to anti-lynching and voting rights laws. Dodd strove to protect children through measures such as curbing the violence on television and stemming the traffic of illegal drugs.</p><p>Dodd vigorously opposed Soviet Communism, which he considered the moral equivalent of German Nazism. He similarly warned against admitting Communist China to the United Nations and advocated the formation of \"freedom academies\" to raise anticommunism to a scholarly level. Although an early and ardent supporter of the United Nations, Dodd grew increasingly disillusioned with this organization as it gradually became more representative of Third World interests. In 1968 he called for the resignation of U.N. Secretary General U Thant for opposing the U.S. presence in Vietnam.</p><p>President Johnson briefly considered naming Dodd as his vice-presidential running mate in 1964, but opted instead for Senator Hubert Humphrey . The publicity surrounding the vice-presidential selection may have served as a reward for Dodd's support of Johnson during the 1960 presidential campaign. In 1964 Johnson enthusiastically endorsed Dodd during a campaign swing through Connecticut and Dodd won his second Senate term with a landslide victory over former Republican governor John D. Lodge . Dodd evolved into a sort of unofficial foreign policy spokesman in the Senate for the Johnson administration. When the President authorized an incursion into the Dominican Republic in 1965, Dodd emerged as one of the administration's most outspoken defenders. Such behavior exacerbated a growing feud between Dodd and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright of Arkansas . The two exchanged condemnatory press releases and subsequently clashed over Vietnam .</p><p>Dodd consciously cultivated an image of himself as a party maverick. In part this stance reflected his poor relationship with John M. Bailey . He championed electoral reform during his 1958 Senate campaign in order to, in effect, \"democratize\" the nomination process against better known candidates such as Abraham Ribicoff . His proposals included a direct primary for all major state offices, the election of the party chairman by the state convention, a binding presidential preference primary, public hearings before creating a party platform, court reform, and reduction of patronage. Dodd's independence from his party extended beyond the state level. In the Senate, he displayed a relatively low degree of partisanship as measured against his Democratic colleagues. Dodd did not hesitate to criticize the Kennedy administration for waging what he perceived as an ineffective campaign against the Castro regime in Cuba . He provided strong support to the Nixon administration over Vietnam at a time when the Democratic Party experienced deep divisions over this and other issues. He never enjoyed particularly amiable relations with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield because Dodd often publicly questioned his party's leadership and policies.</p><p>In 1966 allegations of financial impropriety surfaced against Thomas Dodd. The Senate began holding hearings the following year to investigate Dodd for his alleged transgressions. Senator Russell Long (D-La.) conducted a vigorous and ultimately unsuccessful campaign to clear Dodd's name. The Senate voted 92-5 to censure him for diverting public funds for private use (primarily through the use of testimonial dinners). He escaped censure on the charge of double billing the government by a vote of 51-45.</p><p>In 1970 Dodd withdrew his name from consideration by the Democratic State Convention after learning that he would not receive renomination for the Senate. He proceeded to mount an unsuccessful independent campaign against Republican Lowell Weicker and Democrat Joe Duffy . Dodd retired from public life following Weicker's triumph. He died in his Old Lyme home on 24 May 1971, at the age of 64.</p><citation>From the guide to the Thomas J. Dodd Papers, undated, 1919-1971., (Archives &amp; Special Collections at the Thomas J.

WorldCat record id: 155863009</citation><p><span>The Third Programme of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was inaugurated on September 29, 1946, as part of the BBC's post-war restructuring of radio into three networks. Responding to the public's growing interest in the arts, which BBC programs during World War II had helped to foster, the BBC instituted three complementary networks designed not only to inform and entertain, but to educate the public as well: the Home Service, the Light Programme, and the Third Programme. The Home Service provided a broad range of news, educational, and entertainment services and was the principal channel. The Light Programme, as the name implies, offered lighter fare which was intended purely for relaxation and amusement purposes. The Third Programme was more serious in nature and catered to an esoteric audience. Its purpose, as outlined by Sir William Haley, was to present \"the great classical repertoire in music and drama, and, so far as they are broadcastable, in literature and the other arts,\" things \"culturally satisfying and significant.\" The BBC defined the program as \"being for the educated rather than an educational programme.\" The esoteric nature of the Third Programme proved to be detrimental rather than beneficial to the BBC. Although the BBC was generally praised for its noble ambition of raising cultural standards, the Third Programme's small following made the program less than cost-efficient. Saddled with rising production costs and stung by criticism of the Third Programme's elitist tendencies, the BBC decided in 1957 to curtail the program. Its decision was met with much protest, which came primarily from a small but highly organized following. Several hundred constituents organized The Third Programme Defense Society and enlisted support from a number of well-known intellectuals such as T. S. Eliot, Albert Camus, and Sir Laurence Olivier, who headed the Society's seven-man delegation. Despite the Society's efforts, the Third Programme was truncated--its air time was reduced from 40 to 24 hours a week--but was otherwise materially unaltered. It continued to offer a combination of spoken word and music, though with fewer repeats and fewer long speeches, until 1970. At that point, aware of listener divisions the three-network system had perpetrated, BBC virtually phased out the Third Programme, allotting it only eight hours per week and merging much of the program's material with that of Radio Four, which had been developed for a more general audience.</span></p><p>Paulu, Burton.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Academic administrator and educator during integration, William Charles Akins was born in 1932 in Austin, Texas. He attended segregated Blackshear Elementary School. He next went to Kealing Junior High School and then Anderson High School where he met W.B. Campbell who inspired him to become a principal. He graduated from Huston-Tillotson University with his B.A. degree in history in 1954 and received his M.A. degree from Prairie View A&amp;M University in 1956. Akins also received his administrative certification from Southwest Texas State University.</p><p>In 1959, Akins began teaching at Anderson High School, his alma mater, also known as Old Anderson. Three years after beginning, he was recognized as Anderson's Teacher of the Year. In 1964, Akins was selected to be the first African American teacher at Johnson High School, a recently desegregated school. In 1971, he returned to Anderson High School to serve as Assistant Principal where he served until it was closed due to busing desegregation laws. He was then transferred to Lanier High School before becoming the first principal of the new L.C. Anderson High School in 1973. Akins worked through conflicts to set the school on its feet.

May 4, 2005, Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Saida Gerrard was a performer, choreographer, student and teacher of modern dance. She grew up in Toronto, Canada in a family of Russian Jewish immigrants. Her parents were amateur musicians who exposed her to music and dance at an early age. As a child, she studied music and dance at the Hambourg Conservatory of Music in Toronto and at the Toronto Conservatory of Music, including Dalcroze Eurythmics with Madeleine Boss Lasserre. She would go on to study dance and perform with some of the greatest individuals in modern dance, including Vilzak-Scholler, Margaret Craske, Hanya Holm, Louis Horst, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Martha Graham, Fe Alf, Amy Sternberg, and Benjamin Zemach.</p><p>In the late 1930s Gerrard moved to New York where she studied on scholarship with Hanya Holm at the Mary Wigman School. From 1943-1948, she studied modern dance techniques with Martha Graham. In 1945, she joined the Charles Weidman Company. During this time she studied composition with Weidman, Louis Horst and Doris Humphrey. She was a principal dancer with the Charles Weidman Company on three national and five East Coast tours. Gerrard performed with Hanya Holm and Weidman for a festival at the New York City Center. She was also a principal dancer and soloist at festivals in Vermont, Massachusetts and New York. In addition to her dance performances she served as the Assistant Choreographer and soloist with the New York City Opera in performances of Aida, Traviata, and Love of Three Oranges . From 1945-1953, she frequently returned to Canada to serve as a guest artist with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Gerrard taught the Graham Technique in New York from 1945 until 1950. From 1950-1953, she taught at the Humphrey-Weidman School.</p><p>In 1953, Gerrard moved to Los Angeles with her American pianist husband Aube Tzerko. While in Los Angeles, Gerrard taught masters classes and gave lectures, demonstrations, and workshops at USC, UCLA, the Idyllwild Arts Festival, Los Angeles City College, the University of Judaism, Pasadena City College, as well as, a variety of other colleges and high schools throughout Southern California. She also gave performances and lectures on Hebraic dance and modern dance with Jewish themes at many of the Los Angeles area Jewish temples. From 1953-1960, Gerrard performed with the Saida Gerrard Theater Dance Company for the Long Beach Symphony, the Idyllwild Arts Festival, Bovard Auditorium at USC Schoenberg Hall at UCLA and at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. She choreographed and performed the operas The Consul at USC, Secret of Suzanne at the University of Judaism, and Hansel and Gretel for three consecutive years at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, CA.</p><p>In 1960, Gerrard began teaching at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. She was the Director of the Saida Gerrard School of Contemporary Dance, where she taught technique and choreography for adults, children, actors, and singers, from 1957-1970. From 1960-1964, Gerrard toured the West Coast with her Saida Gerrard Theatre Dance Company and performed twenty-seven concerts under the management of Columbia Artists. She choreographed and performed with a group of thirty dancers. Her company performed New Exodus with symphony and choir at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, and at the Shrine Auditorium and Wilshire-Ebell Theater in Los Angeles. She choreographed Don Giovanni in 1964, for the first season of the Los Angeles Opera, which was then called the Los Angeles Civic Grand Opera, at the new Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. From 1965-1969, Gerrard continued to perform and choreograph her works such as Marais and Miranda at the Morgan Theater in Santa Monica; Pimpinone at Royce Hall, UCLA; and The Bartered Bride at the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles. In 1973, she staged two Los Angeles performances, The Measure Taken by Bertolt Brecht at the Mark Taper Forum and The Golem at the Gindi Auditorium. The following year she staged sixteen performances as the Director of Dance for Theater Arts Program of Los Angeles. In 1975, Gerrard received a grant from the California Arts Commission, which she used to stage a performance of Ancestral Memories, music by Aaron Copland, with the Theater Dance Company at the Gindi Auditorium in Los Angeles.</p><p>Gerrard began working in Aspen, Colorado in 1971. She taught, studied, danced, and staged performances there until 1977. She choreographed contemporary opera and works by Mozart, Stravinsky, and resident composers; attended seminars at the Institute for the Humanities; and conducted summer workshops for Colorado Mountain College. In 1971, Gerrard became the Director and teacher of dance and choreography for the Aspen Music School and Opera. She would continue in this position until 1977.</p><p>In 1977, Gerrard again focused her work in the Los Angeles area. She taught dance and choreography at the University of Judaism, where she also served as the Chairwoman of the Modern Dance Department, and at the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles from 1977-1980. In 1980, she began teaching dance and choreography at Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles. She was also the Founder, Director and Choreographer for the Saida Gerrard Heritage Dance Company, which performed at the Immaculate Heart College, Temple Judea, University Synagogue, Temple Emmanuel, Stephen Wise Temple, and the Leo Baeck Temple, all of which are located in Los Angeles. The Heritage Dance Company focused on works related to her Jewish heritage.</p><p>Saida Gerrard's commissions included choreographed oratorios for the New York Philharmonic Chorus and the Toronto Peoples Chorus; Song of Miriam for the Detroit Folk Choir; New Exodus (Di Naye Hagode) for the Chicago Philharmonic Chorus and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Choir; and a grant from the California Arts Commission to choreograph Ancestral Memories .

(Unknown). WorldCat record id: 122605099</citation><p>Bergen Baldwin Evans was born on September 19, 1904 in Franklin, Ohio, the third child of Rice Kemper and Louise Cass Evans' six children. Evans joined the faculty of Northwestern University as in the department of English in 1932. He was an incredibly popular instructor, and remained at Northwestern until his retirement in 1974. In addition to his career as an English scholar, Evans was an author and was involved with many television and radio programs. He died in 1978.</p><p>In 1909 Evans' father, a fourth generation doctor, gave up his practice to accept a clerkship in the consular service in Sheffield, England. The family lived there until 1915 when Rice Evans' salary could no longer support his large family. That and the outbreak of World War I forced him to send his children back to America to live with an aunt in Franklin, Ohio.</p><p>Bergen Evans was educated in both English and American schools and entered Miami University in Oxford, Ohio at the age of fifteen. Despite nearly being dismissed after his first year as a result of his unorthodox study habits, Evans graduated in 1924 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. After earning an M.A. from Harvard in 1925 he returned to Miami University and taught English from 1925 to 1928. Thereafter he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar from 1929 to 1931, receiving a B.Litt. degree in 1930. He returned to Harvard where he received a Ph.D. in English Philology in 1932. The subject of his dissertation was Samuel Johnson's career as a biographer.</p><p>In September of 1932, Evans began his teaching career at Northwestern as an Instructor in English. He remained at Northwestern until his retirement in 1974, being promoted to Assistant Professor in 1936, Associate Professor in 1939, and Professor in 1944. His courses, in particular, Introduction to Literature, became extremely popular, enrolling more students than any other course offered at the university.</p><p>Evans simultaneously pursued a second career as an author, publishing short stories in national magazines. As a result he won the Scribner Prize in 1939. As a feature writer for the American Mercury from 1947 to 1950 he contributed a column entitled \"The Skeptics Corner.\" Evans also published a number of books, with the first coming about by chance. Teaching in the university's Evening Division he became acquainted with a student, Herman Bishop, a mechanic, with whom he wrote Your Car is Made to Last, a car repair book for the layman. Evans second book, The Psychiatry of Robert Burton, written with G.J. Mohr in 1944, analyzed Burton's grasp of modern psychology while writing in the 17th century. His first book to gain popular attention was The Natural History of Nonsense (1946). He next published The Spoor of Spooks and Other Nonsense (1954) as a result of his long-standing interest in myths and superstitions.</p><p>Evans' major contribution to scholarship was The Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage, which he authored in collaboration with his sister, Cornelia Evans Goodhue, in 1957. A vocabulary-building book containing chapters on British-American vocabulary, Word-A-Day, was released in 1963. Evans also wrote two reference works: Dictionary of Quotations (1968) and Dictionary of Mythology (1970). Evans also edited anthologies and literary works, including two relating to Samuel Johnson, and wrote essays, book introductions, and textbook chapters, as well as numerous magazine and newspaper articles, and delivered numerous lectures.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Evans appeared on television and radio. After appearing briefly in a television program entitled \"Majority Rules,\" Evans became a nationally known personality through \"Down You Go,\" a program based on the parlor game \"hang the butcher.\" The program originated in Chicago and ran from 1951 - 1956 and was revived from 1961 - 1963.</p><p>Evans was also involved in several other television and radio panel shows through the 1950s and early 1960s, including \"Of Many Things,\" \"Superghost,\" \"English for Americans,\" \"Inquiry,\" \"The Last Word,\" \"Words in the News,\" and \"Conversation.\" For most of these programs Evans commuted to New York every weekend.</p><p>Although he did not appear on the program, beginning in 1955 Evans prepared questions used on the television game show \"The $64,000 Question.\" In 1959 the producers of the show were accused of coaching contestants, including giving them the questions in advance. Illinois State Representative Peter F. Mack, Jr. accused Evans of having been a part of the scandal and called for his resignation from Northwestern. Evans emerged from the scandal unscathed, having received the full support of his students and Northwestern president J. Roscoe Miller.</p><p>Evans retired from teaching in May of 1974, having taught three years past the University's mandatory retirement age of 68. He died on February 4, 1978.</p><p>Evans married Jean Whinery on August 5, 1939. They had two sons, Derek and Scott. Among the many honors Evans received during his long and productive career were the 1957 Peabody Award for outstanding public service in broadcasting, honorary degrees from Miami (Ohio) University in 1959 and Franklin and Marshall College and the Ohioana Career Medal in 1972.</p><citation>From the guide to the Bergen Evans (1904-1978) Papers, 1921-1978, (Northwestern University Archives)</citation><p>Ashley Montagu, born Israel Ehrenberg on June 28, 1905, was a British-American anthropologist, specializing in the areas of race and gender issues, as well as a prolific speaker and author, publishing over 50 books in his lifetime. The son of Jewish tailor Charles Ehrenberg and his wife, Mary Plot Ehrenberg, Montagu was born and raised in London's working class East End neighborhood. Although the reasoning behind his name change was never revealed, it may have been due to anti-Semitic prejudice faced by many East End Jews during his childhood, and Montagu might have felt the need to distance himself from his parents' Russian and Polish backgrounds.</p><p>Montagu earned his undergraduate degree from University College London in psychology and anthropology. After studying anthropology at the London School of Economics under Bronislaw Malinowski, Montagu left England for the United States. He arrived at New York City in 1927 and began taking graduate classes at Columbia University. Montagu then traveled to Italy in 1928, where he took classes in ethnography and anthropology at the University of Florence. Upon his return to the United States in 1931, while working as an assistant professor of anthropology at New York University, Montagu married Marjorie Peakes. The couple would have two daughters, Audrey and Barbara, as well as a son, Geoffrey. In 1934 Montagu returned to Columbia University, culminating his postgraduate work at Columbia in 1936 with his dissertation, Coming into being among the Australian Aborigines: A study of the procreative beliefs of the native tribes of Australia, produced under the direction of Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. Based largely on his dissertation, Montagu's first book, Coming into Being among the Australian Aborigines, was published in 1937. After he completed his education, Montagu taught anatomy at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1938 and became an American citizen in 1940. It was during his time at Hahnemann that he began to produce work relating to race, resulting in his seminal work, Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race, published in 1942. The work controversially advanced the argument that race was a social construct imposed upon a complex biological substratum and demolished the arguments for inherent inequality between human populations. The influential nature of Man's Most Dangerous Myth led to Montagu's service on the 4th United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) task force, in 1949. The ten member UNESCO committee, composed of such world-renowned social scientists as Claude Levi-Strauss and E. Franklin Frazier, was created to collect information about the problem of race and to establish educational programs to disseminate its findings. The resultant document, authored by Montagu, the group's rapporteur, was published as the \"Statement on Race\" in 1951. The Committee's final statement on race asserted: 1)All mankind belong to the same species and that the differences between groups are few compared to all of the genetic similarities. 2)That Race designates a group with high frequency of physical characteristics or particular genetic trait and that these traits fluctuate or even disappear over time. 3)The way in which people are grouped does not reflect the capacity or character traits of a particular group. The differences between races are physical and have no correlation with other traits like intelligence.</p><p>Upon leaving Hahnemann Medical College in 1949, Montagu moved to Rutgers University, where he was a professor of anthropology and head of the department from 1949 to 1955. While at Rutgers, Montagu wrote perhaps his most famous work, The Natural Superiority of Women, published in 1953. Examining the differences between the sexes anthropologically, Montagu concluded that women were the superior sex because they possessed a better capability to survive both as individuals and in groups- talents necessary for an advancing society. Based on these conclusions, he suggested that women receive equal pay for equal work, a controversial stance at the time.</p><p>With his prolific writing skills to rely on financially, and facing strong backlash for his openly liberal views and anti-McCarthy public statements, Montagu accepted a forced retirement from Rutgers in 1955 at the age of 50. Though retired from academic life, he continued to lecture at such institutions as Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Santa Barbara, and New York University. Settling in Princeton, New Jersey, Montagu's work took up a more humanist element with Touching: The Human Significance of the Skin, his effort to encourage parents to take a more physical role in raising their children and especially to encourage mothers to breastfeed their babies. Published during that same year, Montagu's book The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity, a history of the life of disfigured Briton Joseph Merrick, inspired a Tony winning play and later a motion picture. He continued publishing through the 1980s, including The Nature of Human Aggression (1976) and Growing Young (1981), while making numerous and notable television appearances on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show as well as the Phil Donahue Show.</p><p>In his lifetime, Montagu received many major awards, among them the American Association of Humanists' 1995 Man of the Year award, the Darwin Award from the American Association of Physical Anthropologist in 1994, and the Distinguished Achievement Award from the American Anthropological Association in 1987. Montagu maintained an active schedule of lecturing and gardening around his Princeton, New Jersey, home until he was hospitalized in March 1999; he died on November 26, 1999 from heart disease, at the age of ninety-four. He was survived by his wife of sixty-eight years, Marjorie, as well as his son and two daughters.</p><citation>From the guide to the Ashley Montagu papers, 1927-1999, 1927-1999, (American Philosophical Society)</citation></biogHist>",

The purpose of the farm bureaus was to coordinate the agricultural activities of the county and to work in cooperation with other local farm associations. The farm bureaus also employed a county agent to act as leader, and it was his responsibility to conduct agricultural demonstrations, offer advice to individual farmers, conduct agricultural meetings, and work with rural schools. The agent was supported financially by grants from the federal and state governments and funds raised within the organized counties. In addition, the county farm bureaus of Iowa cooperated directly with the United States Department of Agriculture and the Iowa State College (University) Agricultural Extension Department.</p><p>Within five years of the formation of the first farm bureaus in Iowa, farmers in thirty counties were organized. As the United States entered into World War I, an effort was made to organized the farmers in all of Iowa's counties. By June 1, 1918, all ninety-nine counties in Iowa were organized, forming a total of one hundred farm bureaus (Pottawattamie county was split into eastern and western halves).</p><p>The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation was formed December 27, 1918, at a meeting in Marshalltown attended by delegates from seventy-two of the state's one hundred coutny farm bureau organizations. During that meeting, the constitution and bylaws were formulated and executive officers and members of the board of directors were selected. James R. Howard of Marshall County was elected the first president of the IFBF. During its first year, the IFBF lobbied state and federal legislatures, assisted in establishing other agriculture-related organizations, created a federation publication, and joined with other state organizations to form the American Farm Bureau Federation. By the end of 1919, IFBF membership surpassed 100,000 members.</p><p>From its inception, the purpose of the IFBF was to help farm families prosper and improve their quality of life. Over the years IFBF has confronted a wide variety of issues ranging from global trade agricultural education and research, distribution and marketing of farm goods, farm credit, rural power and communications, soil conservation, and price support programs to name just a few. Membership in the IFBF is open to people of any occupation and, as of 2007, claims over 150,000 member families to be part of its organization.</p><citation>From the description of Records, 1914- (Iowa State University). WorldCat record id: 85774022</citation><p>Evolved from a Crop Improvement Association which was partially financed by Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck and Company and Chambers of Commerce. Iowa counties of Clinton, Scott, Black Hawk, Muscatine, Montgomery, Clay and Greene became active and organized in July 1912. During World War I, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture designated the County Crop Improvement Associations to promote stepped up food production and food conservation. By the end of the war, all County War Emergency organizations felt the need for a permanent farm association. When they became permanent, the name was changed to County Farm Bureau. Before the end of 1917 every county in Iowa had a Farm Bureau. The federating of the County Farm Bureaus took place in December of 1918.</p><p>The object of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation was \"to develop, strengthen and correlate the work of the County Farm Bureaus of the state; to encourage and promote cooperation of all representative agricultural organizations in every effort to improve and facilitate conditions for the economic and efficient production of, conservation of, marketing of, transportation of and distribution of farm products; to further the study and enactment of constructive agricultural legislation; to advise with representatives of the public agricultural institutions cooperating with Farm Bureaus in the determination of state-wide policies and to inform Farm Bureau members regarding all movements that affect their interests.\"</p><citation>From the description of Records, 1920-1976.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>The Co-operative Printing Society was formed in Manchester as the North of England Co-operative Printing Society in 1869 by a group of printers, some of whom had worked for the Manchester Guardian. £1 shares were made available to the public and when £1,000 had been raised, the business commenced operation as letterpress printers and stationers, also undertaking bookbinding, ruling, lithography and other printing work.</p><p>The Co-operative Newspaper Society was formed in 1871 and registered as a co- operative. Its members were co-operative societies in the UK. The Society was formed to publish the first national newspaper of the co-operative movement, called the Co operative News and published weekly from September 1871 becoming a bi-weekly newspaper in 2006. Earlier journals had been published by individuals and changed their subject coverage according to the changing interests of their publisher. This was the first time that co-operative societies had come together to produce their own newspaper, an independent periodical, not tied to any particular organisation or section of the co-operative sector. The Co-operative News has always been based in Manchester and was printed by the Co-operative Printing Society. Scotland had its own Newspaper Society and its own newspaper, the Scottish Co operator which was published from 1893 to 1974 when it merged with the Co-operative News.</p><p>Following campaigns in the early 1880s the Co-operative News began a Women's Corner in January 1883, which is credited with leading to the creation of the Women's Co-operative Guild, one of the oldest women's organisations in the UK.</p><p>Following the recommendations of a Survey Committee, the English and Scottish Co-operative Newspaper Societies amalgamated in 1921 under the name of the National Co operative Publishing Society. There was a further name change in 1935 to the Co-operative Press.</p><p>The publications were, with the exception of Millgate Monthly (a cultural magazine) aimed at a co-operative public. The desire within the co-operative movement for a mainstream newspaper led to the purchase in 1929 of Reynolds News, a Sunday newspaper originally of the chartist movement and with a long radical tradition. Declining sales of the Reynolds News caused a change in name to Sunday Citizen in 1962 and the newspaper ceased publication in 1967.</p><p>In September 1971, the Co-operative Press took over Birmingham Printers, which had been registered as a co-operative society in 1902. In 1970 it was agreed that the Co-operative Printing Society would became part of the Co-operative Press, this was effective from June 1972.</p><p>Traden Publications was a joint venture between the Co operative Press and Leyden Publishing to publish a free distribution newspaper for the Greater Manchester area, formed in 1972 and wound up in 1974.</p><list><item>Bamford, W M (1921) Our Fifty Years 1871-1921: A Jubilee Souvenir of the Co-operative News Manchester: National Co operative Publishing Society Mercer</item><item>T W (1930) Sixty Years of Co-operative Printing 1869 1929 Manchester: Co-operative Printing Society</item><item>Bonner, A (1970) British Co-operation Second edition.

WorldCat record id: 122378686</citation><p>Deems Taylor was born on December 22, 1885 in New York City, and attended Ethical Culture for secondary school there. While a student at New York University he wrote four comic operas with William LeBaron, one of which received the attention of theatrical producer Charles Dillingham and was produced by him. Taking the advice of Victor Herbert, Taylor studied music theory with Oscar Coon. Meanwhile Taylor also began to publish music criticism, first for the New York Press, and later for the New York Tribune (1916-1917), Collier's Weekly (1917-1919).</p><p>Sometime during the mid 1910s Taylor formed a close friendship with Percy Rector Stephens, a vocal instructor and conductor of the Schumann Club. The purpose of the Schumann Club was to deliver programs for women's vocal ensemble that would follow as closely as possible the structure of the artist recital programs. Taylor approached the task with enthusiasm. In addition, Taylor published arrangements and translations of songs and choral music up through 1920.</p><p>Deems Taylor was music critic for the New York World from 1921 through 1925. He continued musical criticism by becoming editor of Musical America (1927-1929) and critic for the New York American 1931-1932). He was pressed into service for radio broadcasts and had a well-received series on music appreciation. He was also commentator for broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. As a result of his reputation as educator, he was selected by Walt Disney as commentator for the film Fantasia (1940). He published articles and several books, The Well Tempered Listener (1940), Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940), Music to My Ears (1949), Some Enchanted Evenings: The Story of Rodgers and Hammerstein (1953).</p><p>After the 1920s Taylor composed large scale works. His orchestral suite Through the Looking Glass was well received. His reputation grew after the premiere of his first mature opera, The King's Henchman (1927), which had its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. Excerpts from The King's Henchman were selected for the inaugural broadcast of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in September 1927. This was surpassed by his next opera, Peter Ibbetson which also premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 1931 which stayed in the repertory for four seasons. Succeeding works were less well received. They include the operas Ramuntcho (1942) and The Dragon (1958), as well as orchestral works and cantatas.</p><p>Deems Taylor died in New York City on July 3, 1966.</p><citation>From the guide to the [Arrangements of choral music by various composers] / Deems Taylor, 1917-1920?, (The New York Public Library.

    "description": "<p>WRUL was the call sign for the radio station that began as W1XAL in Boston, Massachusetts, which was founded on October 15, 1927. Four days after Britain and France declared war on Germany, on September 7, 1939, the Federal Communications Commission assigned call letters WRUL (for World Radio University Listeners) to the station. As it had a large worldwide listening audience, which regularly corresponded with the station and a high power transmitter it was seen by British Security Co-ordination, a covert organization that the British Secret Intelligence Service established in New York City as a vehicle for conducting political warfare on behalf of the British. The station was transmitting mostly in English so BSC provided through third parties the finance, translators, and foreign language announcers to produce high-quality programming in other languages. BSC also provided the material to be broadcast and so by 1941 WRUL had become unknowingly an arm of the BSC though outwardly independent and believing itself to be so. From 1939 to 1942, WRUL broadcast radio lectures to Europe and South America in eight languages, and also in the United States over an informal network of over 300 stations.</p>\n<p>Like all United States shortwave stations, in November 1942 the U.S. government leased WRUL for further wartime propaganda broadcasts. In 1946, station president Walter Lemmon requested return of control over the station from the War Communications Board. WRUL was allowed to resume partial independent programming in 1947, and full independent programming in 1954. Metromedia bought the station in 1960. In June 1962, International Educational Broadcasting Corporation, owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, bought WRUL. On June 1, 1966, WRUL changed its call letters to WNYW, which stood for Radio New York Worldwide. <citation> From the combined records of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), held by the University of Maryland and the Wisconsin Historical Society, and compiled as part of the Unlocking the Airwaves project (unlockingtheairwaves.org).</citation></p>",

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Michigan was among the first schools in the nation to formally incorporate instruction in the field of speech into its curriculum. The subject's inclusion was largely the result of Thomas C. Trueblood's work. In the later nineteenth century, Trueblood made his living traveling from university to university offering short courses in speech. He first came to Ann Arbor in 1884 and his six week course was so popular with students that he began to return for longer and longer residences. Finally, in 1889 he became a permanent faculty member of the University of Michigan. In 1892 the Department of Elocution and Oratory was created, with Trueblood as its sole member. Trueblood remained chair of the department until 1926.</p><p>Over the years the department's formal title changed frequently, reflecting the broad area of instruction that fell under its mantle. The original name was simplified to the Department of Oratory in 1908. Subsequent titles included Department of Public Speaking (1919-1927); Department of Speech (1927-1932); Department of Speech, Phonetics, and General Linguistics (1932); Department of Speech and General Linguistics (1932-1939); Department of Speech (1939-1972); and Department of Speech Communication and Theater (1972-1979). In 1979, as part of a major reorganization of several units, the Department of Speech Communication and Theater was formally eliminated. Elements of the department's program were relocated in two new units; the Department of Theatre and Drama and the Department of Communication.</p><citation>From the guide to the Dept. of Speech (University of Michigan) records, 1928-1978, (Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan)</citation></biogHist>",

As a result of a Ford Foundation grant in the early 1960s, the Montana Educational Television Committee conducted a major study of educational television resulting in the publication of TV for Montana Education. The 1971 Legislative Assembly mandated that the Superintendent of Public Instruction coordinate efforts to set up an educational television system and appoint an advisory committee, but it provided no funds. Three years later the legislature established the Educational Broadcasting Commission to supercede the previous advisory committee. This commission expired in 1977. From 1972 through 1974 Montana cooperated in two programs of the Federation of Rocky Mountain States: the Educational Technology Demonstration and the Satellite Technology Demonstration.

His career also included radio, film, and television. His film credits include AFFAIR IN TRINIDAD (1952), THE BIG HEAT (1953), THE GLORY BRIGADE (1953), THE SILVER CHALICE (1959), RANSOM (1956), and THE BIG FISHERMAN (1959). He is best known as Polo, the Mexican ranch foreman in GIANT (1956).</p><p>His television credits include NBC's television series Project 20, and other series including Playhouse 90, the Circle Theater, Studio One, and National Geographic. He considered his most important work to be his recordings of talking books for the American Foundation for the Blind and his own company Lectern Records. In 1943 he married the actress Lori Von Eltz, whose professional name is Lori March.</p><p>Alexander Scourby died February 22, 1985.</p><citation>From the description of Papers, film, and sound recordings 1935-1985. (New York Public Library). WorldCat record id: 122485449</citation><p>Although he had a long and varied career as an actor and narrator, Alexander Scourby (1913-1985), considered his most important work to be the performances he gave as a voice actor in the Talking Books recordings he made for the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). Of Greek heritage, Scourby was born in Brooklyn, New York, where his father worked as a restaurateur and commercial baker. In 1931, he graduated from the Brooklyn Manual Training High School. He had developed an interest in writing and performing while in high school, serving as co-editor of the school magazine and yearbook and making his first appearance on stage in a school production of The Meanest Man in the World . Scourby briefly attended the University of West Virginia in Morgantown, West Virginia, but returned to New York in February 1932 to help out with the family business following the death of his father.</p><p>In 1933, Scourby became an apprentice with the Civic Repertory Theatre, run by Eva Le Galliene, where he received a thorough professional training. He made his Broadway debut in 1936 as the Player King in the Leslie Howard production of Hamlet . It was through cast mate, Wesley Addy, that Scourby was introduced to the opportunities offered by the American Foundation for the Blind. Scourby auditioned for the AFB in 1937, and, after playing a few small parts in recordings of plays, he soon found a niche in which he could utilize his impressive speaking voice by reading novels and other works of literature for the Talking Books service. Over the next forty years, he would provide the narration for over 500 books. His best known recording became the full set of the King James version of the Bible (1966).</p><p>Scourby also began working extensively in radio during the 1940s, with recurring roles on several soap operas and regular appearances on the NBC weekly religious program, The Eternal Light . Scourby also did broadcasts in Greek and English for the Office of War Information during the Second World War. In 1943, he married Lori von Eltz, an actress who went by the professional name of Lori March. The two occasionally worked together on theater, film, and television projects. Scourby remained active in summer stock and New York theater throughout the 1940s and early 1950s. Notable productions in which he was featured included Rodney Ackland's adaptation of Crime and Punishment (1947) with Claude Rains, Detective Story (1949), Darkness at Noon (1951), and the Theatre Guild revival of Saint Joan (1951) with Uta Hagen.</p><p>During the 1950s, Scourby began to work more often as an actor in films, frequently playing villains. Among his films were Affair in Trinidad (1952), The Big Heat (1953), Ransom (1956), and Giant (1956). He also worked increasingly in television as both an actor and narrator. His television credits as an actor include Playhouse 90, Circle Theater, and Studio One . As a narrator, he was associated with the NBC television series, Project 20, for many years. Although his work in film and television saw Scourby dividing his time between California and New York, by the 1960s he actively sought employment doing television commercial voice-overs in order to spend more time on the East Coast. In later years, Scourby and his wife maintained a residence in Manhattan and a country home in Newtown, Connecticut.</p><p>In addition to continuing to record Talking Books, both for the AFB and Lectern Records, a company he founded, Scourby also worked steadily as a narrator of documentary, educational, and promotional films during the final two decades of his life. In 1983, he became the host of the public television series, Live from the Met . It was while he was in Boston, taping his segments as the host for a National Public Radio broadcast of Handel's oratorio, Semele, that Scourby unexpectedly took ill and died.</p><citation>From the guide to the Alexander Scourby papers, 1940-1989, (The New York Public Library.

Between 1883 and 1931, the team that would become the Brooklyn Dodgers went through numerous monikers including the Bridegrooms, the Superbas, the Robins, and the Trolley Dodgers--purportedly coined for Brooklynites ability to dodge the dangerous streetcars in Brooklyn. In 1913, the team moved to a new home field, Ebbets Field, and the next year hired Manager Wilbert Robinson (hence the name the Brooklyn Robins) who would become the winningest manager in the teams' history. After 18 years at the helm, Robinson retired as manager in 1931. The following year, in 1932, the team officially became the Brooklyn Dodgers and remained so until the end of 1957 season, when the team was moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>Throughout the teams' history, under various names, the team won the National League Pennant nine times between 1916 to 1957. The Brooklyn Dodgers also made history by being the first team to sign a black player into the modern major leagues--Jackie Robinson. Originally signed to the Dodgers minor league team, the Montreal Royals, in October of 1945, Robinson was brought up to the majors in 1947, where he subsequently earned the Rookie of the Year award that same year. Although the team played in the World Series nine times, they won the World Series only once in 1955. Regardless, the teams' fans were nearly as renowned at the team itself, known for their antics and loyalty. In 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers became the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ebbets Field was demolished in 1960.</p><list><item>Sources:</item><item>Weinstein, Stephen. \"Brooklyn Dodgers.\" InThe Encyclopedia of New York City, edited by Kenneth T. Jackson, 155-156.

However, in 1974 the FSU Artist Series Committee assumed control. Because of financial difficulties in the early 1990s, the Artist Series was briefly discontinued. The series was then entitled the \"Community Concerts in Tallahassee\" and included organizations outside the University.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Founded in 1922 by Foster G. McGaw (1897-1986), the American Hospital Supply Corporation (AHSC) served as a major supplier of health care products to hospitals in the United States and around the world through subsidiaries for over half a century. The AHSC maintained its position of leader in the health care industry until the corporation was acquired by competitor Baxter Travenol in a merger on November 25, 1985.</p><p>The AHSC dominated the hospital supply field during the 1930s and 1940s by changing the way hospital supplies were marketed, designating regional salesman who made frequent sales calls. The AHSC continued to dominate the field by diversifying its product line and later by pursuing vertical integration of suppliers.</p><p>The 1950s and 1960s was a period of strong growth for the AHSC. In 1953, the AHSC reported sales surpassing $37.5 million. Ten years later, sales had jumped to $150 million. By 1964, the AHSC sold to 19 out of 20 hospitals in America. The AHSC also employed one out of every 46 workers in America as well. While the tremendous success enjoyed by the AHSC was a result of the corporations strong leadership, the growth of the hospital industry also played a vital role increasing sales for the AHSC. From 1946 to 1962, the number of hospital beds rose 15%. During that same time, hospital admissions rose by 70%.</p><p>Throughout the history of the AHSC, Foster G. McGaw played a prominent role in the direction of the corporation. McGaw's influence on the day-to-day operations of the AHSC lessened as the corporation expanded and branched out into manufacturing during the 1960s and 1970s. Despite McGaw's waning influence within the AHSC executive structure, he still maintained a role of father figure to the corporation.</p><p>For more information about the AHSC, see Growth Through Service: The Story of the American Hospital Supply Corporation by Frederick D. Sturdivant (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970).</p><citation>From the guide to the American Hospital Supply Corporation Records, 1920-1986, (Northwestern University Archives)</citation></biogHist>",

By the age of 30, when he had arrived in British Columbia, he had received a B.A. in English from Cambridge University, published a novel and travelled to the United States and Mexico. By this time he had begun work on his major novel Under the Volcano. In 1940 he married Margerie Bonner. For the next fifteen years he resided primarily in Dollarton, North Vancouver and travelled abroad before returning to England. His final home was in Sussex, where he died in 1957. From the time he came to British Columbia until his death, Lowry wrote novels, short stories, radio and film scripts and poetry.</p><citation>From the description of Malcolm Lowry collection. 1910-1962.

Their faith is based on the belief that everyone carries within them the Holy Spirit. The destruction of life is, therefore, a grievous sin. In the early nineteenth century the Doukhobors had established themselves as a separate body of settlers in Southern Russia. Living in relative isolation, Doukhoborism became more than a branch of the Christian faith, it also permeated their culture and economic life. They practiced pacificism and vegetarianism and rejected co-operation with political authority when it conflicted with their beliefs. Because of their way of life, the Doukhobors suffered extensive persecution in czarist Russia. In 1898, with the assistance of Count Lev Tolstoy and the English Society of Friends (Quakers), many Doukhobors were able to emigrate to Canada.</p><citation>From the description of Doukhobor research collection. 1839-1980.

President Frank F. Wesbrook secured the services of J.T. Gerould to select and purchase books for the Library. In 1914 John Ridington was hired to catalogue the Library's collections, and in 1916 was appointed UBC's first University Librarian. During his tenure he saw the collection grow from 700 to 125,000 volumes. Ridington also oversaw the move of the collections in 1925 from Fairview to the new Library at the Point Grey campus. He was succeeded by W. Kaye Lamb (1940-1948), Anne Smith (1948-1949, 1951, acting), Leslie W. Dunlap (1949-1951), Neal Harlow (1951-1961), Samuel Rothstein (1961-1962, acting), Jim Ranz (1962-1963), Basil Stuart-Stubbs (1964-1982), Douglas McInnes (1982-1989), William Watson (1989-1990, acting), Ruth Patrick (1990-1997) and Catherine Quinlan (1998- ). In recent years Assistant University Librarians have also been appointed, with specific areas of responsibility. A north wing was added to the Library building in 1948, and a south wing in 1960. The Library's growth led to the reorganisation of its collections and public services into subject-based divisions in 1960. In addition, a process of decentralization was begun in 1952 with the opening of the Bio-Medical Branch Library at Vancouver General Hospital. A more comprehensive decentralization plan, implemented in the 1960s, created a large and dispersed system which by 1999 consisted of two central libraries (Main Library and the Walter C. Koerner Library), thirteen public service branches and divisions, and eight internal service divisions. A three million dollar donation by industrialist H.R. Macmillan in 1965 significantly enhanced the size of the Library's collection, which by the 1990s had grown to over three million books. The Library continues to provide access to recorded knowledge and information - in the form of books, periodicals, manuscripts, audio-visual materials, and electronic media - to students, faculty, and the surrounding community.</p><citation>From the description of Library fonds. 1908-2004.

The legislation established a network of hospitals and related health facilities to provide patient care services, health science teaching, and related medical research. BCMC integrated the resources of numerous institutions including Vancouver General Hospital, UBC Health Science Centre, G.F. Strong Rehabilitation Centre, Children's Hospital, B.C. Cancer Institute, St. Paul's Hospital, and Shaughnessy Hospital. The creation of BCMC would have involved a massive expansion of the Shaughnessy Hospital, which generated a great deal of public controversy. The provincial government disbanded BCMC in 1976 in light of the high cost of its operations.</p><citation>From the description of British Columbia Medical Centre collection. 1973-1977.

He came to the United States when he was eleven years old with his mother and his two younger brothers. It was in New York City where the family settled that Novik first met his father who had come to the United States years earlier. He was educated at a Yeshiva in the city but after graduating decided that he did not want to continue his religious education so at the age of fourteen he was sent to public school.</p><p>At this time Novik became involved with the social-political changes of 1917 engendered by the Russian Revolution. He headed a local chapter of the Young People's Socialist League while he was working at the Daily Record, a newspaper covering issues relating to the manufacture of clothing. He then received a scholarship to the Rand School which Novik described as a \"right-wing socialist school of learning\". During this time he became very involved in the socialist movement, starting a magazine called The Monthly Free Youth and serving as its editor.</p><p>In the early twenties Novik became involved with the Discussion Guild, arranging lectures and debates of well known writers and lecturers. The first speaker he engaged was noted British philosopher Bertrand Russell, who subsequently asked for Novik to represent him in future United States engagements. Through his work with the Discussion Guild Novik also became the manager for Clarence Darrow.</p><p>Novik entered the field of broadcasting in 1932 when he was asked to take over the management of the radio station WEVD in New York. He served as associate manager and program director. It was during this period that he founded the University of the Air.</p><p>Novik entered the field of broadcasting in 1932 when he was asked to take over the management of radio station WEVD in New York. It was during this time that he also founded the University of the Air. He was recruited by New York mayor Fiorello LaGuardia to run radio station WNYC. Novik declined until Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938. He realized it was more important now to keep democracy over the airwaves than to promote socialism and labor interests as he was doing at WEVD. He became director of communications at WNYC (1938-1946) and it while it was at this position that he coined the term \"Public Broadcasting.\" It was also during this time that he became involved in the genesis of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. Novik claimed he was one of the seven men who met in Ames, Iowa in 1939 to plan the permanent organization of this association. He then served as its first executive secretary from 1941 to 1948. Subsequently, Novik was involved in buying or establishing radio stations in Detroit, Cleveland, and the New York area.</p><p>After leaving WNYC in 1946 Novik helped establish radio stations in Detroit and Cleveland. In 1950 he bought the station WLIB in New York on which he established negro programming. He kept this station for 5 years, selling it to his brother Harry in 1955 when he then bought the Italian station WOV. He kept the Italian language format at WOV during his ownership but upon selling this station in 1959 this format was abandoned by the new owners.</p><p>Novik maintained a long relationship with the labor movement, serving as a communications consultant for the American Federation of Labor and later for the merged American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). His career also included some presidential appointments. In 1952 President Truman appointed him to be delegate to the UNESCO conference in Paris. In 1953 he participated in the UNESCO London conference on TV, advising Europeans on how to establish television stations. He was also selected by President Kennedy to serve on the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information in 1962. President Johnson reappointed him to that body.</p><p>Morris S.

Founded in 1951, the Fund had as its purpose to aid and to encourage liberal adult education especially in political, economic, and international affairs and the humanities, with emphasis on study-discussion. However, because of the coincidence of history, the Fund became the main instrument in the establishment of an educational broadcasting system (particularly ETV) in the United States. The Fund had its own board of directors and staff, and it was both a grant-giving and an operating organization. During its early years, the Fund financed the sometimes controversial Test Cities experiment, the purpose of which was to ascertain the best ways to coordinate and stimulate adult education activities, community by community. The Test Cities Project involved individuals and institutions in thirteen United States communities in an experimental and novel educational project. Each of the participating Test Cities programs was independent of the Fund and controlled its own programs. The Fund officially ended its activities in 1961, although it continued as a legal entity (just as some of the projects to which it gave long-term grants continued) after 1961.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Dean of African American historians, John Hope Franklin was born January 2, 1915 in Rentriesville, Oklahoma. His family relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma shortly after the Tulsa Disaster of 1921. Franklin's mother, Mollie was a teacher and his father, B.C. Franklin was an attorney who handled lawsuits precipitated by the famous Tulsa Race Riot. Graduating from Booker T. Washington High School in 1931, Franklin received an A.B. from Fisk University in 1935 and went on to attend Harvard University, where he received his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in history.</p><p>Franklin began his teaching career at Fisk University before moving on to St. Augustine's College. It was at North Carolina Central University, in 1945, with a $500 advance from Alfred A. Knopf, and help from his wife, Aurelia, that Franklin began writing the classic African American history text, From Slavery to Freedom. The book, co-authored by Alfred A. Moss, Jr. is now in its seventh edition and is published in several different languages. Franklin taught at Howard University for nine years, before becoming the first black to chair the History Department at Brooklyn College in 1956. He was then hired by the University of Chicago in 1964 and chaired the History Department from 1967 to 1970. There, he served as the John Matthews Manly Distinguished Service Professor from 1969 to 1982, when he was made Professor Emeritus. In 1982, Franklin joined the faculty at Duke University as the James B. Duke Professor Emeritus of History.</p><p>Active in professional organizations, Franklin has been president of the Southern Historical Society, the Organization of American Historians and the American Historical Association. He is a life long member of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, where he served on the editorial board of the Journal of Negro History. In 1997, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton as chairman of the advisory board for One America, the President's Initiative on Race. Franklin has written hundreds of articles and at least 15 books. His recent works include Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantations with Loren Schweninger, George Washington Williams: A Biography and a book about his father My Life and an Era: the Autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin as well as his own autobiography, The Vintage Years. In 1978 Who's Who in America selected Franklin as one of eight Americans who have made significant contributions to society. Among his many other awards are the Organization of American Historians Award for Outstanding Achievement and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In June 1997, PBS aired First Person Singular: John Hope Franklin, a film produced by Lives and Legacies Films.</p><p>Still sought after as a lecturer and advisor, Franklin lives in Durham, North Carolina, where he cultivates orchids.</p><p>Franklin was interviewed by The HistoryMakers on November 28, 2003.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Franklin, John Hope.

Students from the Archives Concentration and Anderson's class in oral history conducted the interviews with alumnae over Reunion weekend in May 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 in the Alumnae Gymnasium. Interviews were 30 minutes long, on average, and were taped by videographer Kate Geis and Rebecca Rideout, as well as student interviewers. Narrators were asked to reflect on their reasons for choosing Smith, key experiences during their time on campus, significant political and social issues that marked their time at Smith and the impact a Smith education has had on their lives and careers. In 2010, narrators graduated from the classes of 1985-2005. In 2011, narrators were graduates of the classes of 1941-1976. In 2012, narrators were mostly graduates of the classes 1957-1982. In 2013, narrators were primarily graduates of the classes 1943-2008.</p><citation>From the guide to the Alumnae Oral History Project RG12., 2010-2013, (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The materials in this collection have been accumulated over the years from various sources.</p><citation>From the guide to the Historical Postcard Collection RG 10., 1900-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The tradition of dances and recreation at Smith is longstanding.

The first women's collegiate basketball game was held at Smith in 1893 after Berenson adapted the game for women. For many years, all freshmen and sophomores were required to take a sport as part of their regular studies. The Smith College Athletic Association prevented intercollegiate competition, maintaining that it would hurt the spirit of friendly intramural competition at the college, but the intramural programs drew much interest, and spots on class teams were highly coveted. The first intercollegiate games were allowed in 1971, and Smith College joined the Northeast Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. In 1981, Smith became the first women's college to join the NCAA, in which it remains a division III member today.</p><citation>From the guide to the Athletics Subject Files RG 80., ca. 1890-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>Since 1900, Christmas at Smith College has involved the sending of cards, the singing of carols, and, of course, the annual Vespers.

WorldCat record id: 503317234</citation><p>Smith College was incorporated in 1871 and opened with fourteen enrolled students in 1875. Therefore, most of the extant buildings were erected after 1875, though there are quite a few that date from the earlier part of the 19th century and even some from the 18th. The campus is and always has been a mixture of constructed and acquired buildings: Smith' s first three buildings were Dewey House-former home of Northampton judge Charles Augustus Dewey, College Hall-built by the trustees as the first academic and administrative building, and Gateway House-built by the trustees as a home for Smith's first president, L. Clark Seelye (1875-1910). Dewey was home to the very first Smith students and today houses faculty offices and meeting rooms. The present-day campus as a whole serves as an \"architectural garden,\" with styles ranging from Colonial to Greek Revival and Victorian Gothic to neo-Georgian, with a dose of \"modern\" styles added more recently.</p><citation>From the guide to the Buildings Records RG 22., 1875-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The first dramatic productions at Smith were performed by members of societies in the individual student houses on campus. The first of these was formed by Hatfield House in January of 1878 and was named Alpha Society. Washburn and Hubbard Houses soon followed with Olla Podrida in the fall of 1878 and Tertium Quid in 1879, respectively. Houses also occasionally banded together into groups under one name. Sarm Ganok was the name for the Stoddard- Dewey-Hatfield Houses group, and was adapted from the Chinese words for \"Three Houses.\" To these was added Senior Dramatics in 1883 as a feature of Commencement week, although not officially added to the program until 1887. In 1889 the various dramatic societies had achieved official recognition by the administration of the College and in 1891 it became customary for performances to be held in town at the newly-opened Academy of Music. In 1896, owing to the tremendous popularity of Alpha Society, a sister organization was formed, called Phi Kappa Psi, and by 1901 most of the academic departments were also putting on shows. By 1908 the number of productions had out-paced itself to such an extent as to require limitations. The house dramatic groups were dissolved and in their place a divisional system based on class year was instituted. Four new groups were thus formed, each giving one show per year. The groups were called Cap and Bells, Sock and Buskin, The Players and The Mummers. This system was in turn discarded in 1919 when Samuel A. Eliot, of the Department of English Language and Literature, developed the Dramatics Association to replace it and added a course in play production to the Spoken English curriculum. In 1927 even the Senior Dramatics were taken over and all productions were given through the Dramatics Association and the Theatre Workshop, as the performances by Eliot's students were called. That same year also marked the first year of an actor/actress exchange with Amherst College and an end to the tradition of all-female casts in Smith plays. The Department of Theatre was not formed until the 1942-43 academic year, at which time Hallie Flannagan was made its chair. Seven years later, due to flagging student interest and lack of funds, the Dramatics Association voted to merge with the theatre department. All productions thereafter were produced by the department.</p><citation>From the guide to the Dramatics Files RG 80., 1878-1949, (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>Smith College has many traditional special days. One of the earliest special days celebrated at Smith College was Ivy Day. Ivy Day is a day in which departing seniors plant ivy cuts on the Smith grounds, symbolizing their seed of knowledge, in hopes that it will flourish. Many of those traditions include Special Day celebrations for students, staff, faculty and parents.</p><citation>From the description of Files on special days at Smith College, A-Z, 1884-[ongoing].

WorldCat record id: 52235062</citation><p>In 1892, plans designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted were adopted by President Seelye to turn the Smith College campus into a single large botanic garden, labeling all trees and shrub for aesthetic and educational purposes. Francis Ganong was appointed the first director of the botanic garden in 1894, and a systematics garden, based on the theories of Adolf Engler and Karl Prantl was added to the plan under his direction. The master plan has undergone numerous changes, including new systems of walkways and lawns, the expansion of the Lyman Plant House, the construction of a Japanese tea hut and garden, and the reorganization of the herbaceous garden according to more current evolutionary theories.</p><citation>From the guide to the Grounds Subject Files RG 24., 1879-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><citation>From the description of Grounds subject records, 1879-[ongoing].

According to an article written in The Sophian in 1970, \"On this occasion, the date of which is unknown to all except [the college president], bells ring to announce a surprise holiday on which all academic appointments are cancelled.\" Students are encouraged to use this day to take long walks or bike rides and to enjoy a beautiful fall day free from the stress of everyday life.</p><citation>From the guide to the Mountain Day and Picnics Files RG 80., 1882-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>Smith College was incorporated in 1871 and opened with fourteen enrolled students in 1875.

WorldCat record id: 53372597</citation><p>Smith College had booths at several world fairs and expositions from the 1890s to the 1930s, giving the college unique opportunities to publicize its merits. It was one of the only women's colleges to consistently appear at world fairs. The booths highlighted Smith's history, famous figures, campus, educational opportunities, and distinguished alumnae. The four stated purposes of such displays were to 1) greet and aid alumnae (who had often traveled great distances and were unfamiliar with the area); 2) attract new students; 3) \"make friends\" for the college (leave visitors with favorable impressions); and 4) interest possible donors. The booths were staffed by alumnae and local Smith College Clubs played major roles in planning the events.</p><p>The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago was the first time women had taken an active role in planning the fair. The Smith College booth was in the Women's Building, which brought together many booths related to women's interests and was called \"one of the first major expressions of feminist consciousness\" in the country.</p><p>At the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, Smith's booth was in the Palace of Education. This time, the catchphrase was \"bringing Smith to California\" as the college tried to recruit West Coast students. The college took its role as the main representative of higher education for women seriously, and focused on the achievements of college educated women in the world.</p><p>The booth at the 1933 Century of Progress fair in Chicago was located at a highly visible junction in the Hall of Social Sciences. Despite early plans to have a combined Seven Sisters display, in the end Smith was the only women's college to have a booth. However, there was a lounge area for alumnae of all women's colleges elsewhere in the same building. The main attraction of the Smith booth that year was the colorful mural background painted by art professor Oliver Larkin, portraying various aspects of student life at Smith.</p><citation>From the guide to the World Fairs Records RG 12., 1893-1939, (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The tradition of dances and recreation at Smith is longstanding. From social gatherings, teas, and parties in the 1880s and 1890s, to the hosting of \"Supper Dance\" Weekend from the 1920s through the 1940s, to the present day traditions of Friday Teas, Winter Weekend, Spring Weekend and Rugby Prom, Smith has seen its fair share of parties.</p><p>While much of the information regarding the gatherings cannot be found in the folders, many of the photographs tell their own stories.</p><p>There is a plethora of information about the Supper Dance. Preceded by 'walk arounds\" in the 1880s, when the Glee Club was founded in 1888, it hosted a yearly spring concert, which gradually evolved into Spring Dance and Supper Dance. Organized by a student committee, the dance was open to the entire college, with each house hosting its own dance and hired bands. Because Smith women are \"unusually smart as well as unusually attractive, and . . . their hospitality is rightly famous\" according to an article for LIFE magazine, the Supper dance was unusually popular and especially well anticipated by male guests. As their hosts, Smithies paid for their weekend and were allowed to cut in on couples and choose their dance partners. The weekend consisted of Friday classes, dancing lasting the greater part of Saturday with a break for dinner, and Sunday activities. The dance was so famous as to attract photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt of LIFE magazine to take pictures for an article about the Supper Dance in 1937. The Supper Dance continued until the 1940s, probably when wartime took its toll.</p><citation>From the guide to the Dances and Recreation Files RG 80., 1881-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The Smith Centennial Study, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, was a project that President Mendenhall asked Jacqueline Van Voris to undertake in 1970 as an oral history project for Smith College's centennial celebration. Ms. Van Voris dedicated over four years to the project, which culminated with the publication of the book, College: A Smith Mosaic, which she submitted as partial fulfillment of requirements for her MA in Education in 1975. The purpose of the study was to provide a source of information about the importance of education in women's lives. Smith alumnae were interviewed, their observations were recorded on tape and the tapes were transcribed. The interviews were informal conversations conducted in a manner designed to extract pertinent information. The questions were designed to stimulate conversation and to keep the focus on the respondent. Phrasing of the questions encouraged the respondent's frank appraisal of her education. Questions typically asked included: \"Why did you decide to go to Smith? Was it your idea? What was your academic preparation? What courses did you study? What are your remembrances of Smith? What is your general assessment of the education you received? How could college have helped you more? Have your views on education changed over the years since your graduation? Have you ever felt discriminated against because you are a woman?\"</p><p>The interviews were conducted and recorded from 1971-74. The book, College: A Smith Mosaic, was published in February, 1975 and lists of respondents were sent to the Directory of Oral History Collections for inclusion in that directory.</p><citation>From the guide to the Smith Centennial Study Oral History Project RG 12., 1970-75, (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The Student Demonstrations files document how Smith College students have expressed their opposition to national and local issues through rallies and protests since 1933. Major events such as the United States' involvement in World War II, presidential elections, and segregation prompted the majority of student demonstrations from the 1930s to 1960s. Issues of the 1980s and 1990s include opposition to the Persian Gulf War, support for Ada Comstock Scholars, as well as rallies to help improve women's safety on college campuses.</p><p>The 1986 occupation of College Hall makes up the largest portion of the Student Demonstration files. These folders contain both primary and secondary sources, documenting Smith students' opposition to the Board of Trustees' investment in South African companies that contributed to apartheid.</p><citation>From the guide to the Student Demonstrations Files RG 80., ca. 1933-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>The idea of a nationally coordinated student strike developed over a period of at least two years of growing tension between the federal administration and minority and student groups who expressed dissatisfaction with the undeclared war in Vietnam, the military draft, and economic consequences of the war. Coordinated by the National Moratorium Committee (organized in June 1969), Moratorium Days held on October 15, 1969 and November 15, 1969 included the suspension of classes, neighborhood canvassing, protest marches and petitions. The third week in March 1970 was proclaimed National Anti-Draft Week. Planned demonstrations were held at local draft board offices, and \"we won't go\" petitions were circulated. In 1970, the Fast for Peace was held on April 13, 14, and 15, as an expression of moral concern about the war. In early May, student opposition intensified with the knowledge of the expansion of the conflict into Cambodia, President Nixon's April 3 announcement of his decision to resume bombing in North Vietnam, and the treatment of dissenters in the United States. On May 4, the day of the killings on the Kent State University campus, \"leaders of the National Student Association and the former Vietnam Moratorium Committee officially called for a nationwide strike of indefinite duration\" (Facts on File 1970, p.299).</p><p>At Smith, the Moratorium Days were occasions for student involvement in the local community. Smith students staffed the Green Street Moratorium office, canvassed residents, and coordinated marches down Main Street with the cooperation of local businesses. The first Moratorium Day was October 15, 1969 and was called Work for Peace Day at Smith. Smith's Chaplain the Rev. Richard P. Unsworth participated in a memorial service for Hampshire County veterans held at the Unitarian Church. On the second Moratorium Day, November 15, 1969, a contingent of 250 Smith students and 10 Smith professors attended the march in Washington, D. C to protest the Vietnam War. In Northampton, the weekend of November 15 included a teach-in at Wright Hall, a silent march from Helen Hills Hills Chapel to the center of Northampton and back, and well-attended coffee klatches held in a number of Northampton homes.</p><p>A timeline of activities at Smith during the May, 1970 Strike is provided below. During and after the strike, alumnae and friends of the college became involved. On May 30, President Mendenhall announced that his office was receiving 10 letters a day expressing opinions about the strike (tape recording of last Chapel,../../70). Many seminars were repeated during Commencement Weekend for the benefit of alumnae and parents, and a video tape of many of the strike activities was shown. The following organizations formed at Smith due to the strike: the Strike Committee, the Education Committee, the Community Action Committee, Union for National Draft Opposition, Committee on Justice and Repression at Home, Unofficial Committee of Concerned Citizens, Committee on Governance, and the People's Lobby. The activities of the People's Lobby continued beyond the academic year, with students working in Northampton, in Washington D. C., and in their hometown to spread information and coordinate lobbying efforts. Several existing Smith organizations took part in Strike activities; these include: the Student Government Association, the Committee on Educational Policy, the Faculty - Student Committee, and the Young Republican Club.</p><chronList><chronItem>May 4, 5 p.m.At regularly scheduled all-college meetings, a few students and a professor speak about strike issues, and there is a discussion of race/foreign policy distinction.</chronItem><chronItem>May 4, 8 p.m.About 30 people opposed to the strike gather in front of Neilson Library.

Over time, these celebrations evolved from essentially social dinners or receptions into daylong college events. The addition of a 'rally' to the day in 1894 was eventually reflected in the name Rally Day, first used in 1906. The celebration is now held annually on the third Wednesday in February.</p><p>Through the years, students have sponsored and participated in a range of activities: rallies, debates, basketball rivalries, dramatic presentations, singing and dancing. The current tradition of sponsoring an event to benefit a charity began in 1918 when the Rally Day Show was held to raise funds for the Smith College Relief Unit serving in World War I France.</p><p>The Smith College Medal has been awarded to outstanding alumnae at Rally Day since 1973. The medalists have become an important part of the program, speaking prior to convocation in classes and afterward in conversations with students.</p><p>Dress at Rally Day has evolved as well. In 1944, the senior class began wearing its graduation caps and gowns to the convocation. The day still marks the first time the seniors publicly wear their gowns. In recent years, however, the caps have been replaced by inventive hats of the students' choosing (and sometimes of their own making), in keeping with the 'rallying' and spirited nature of the day.\" (From the Rally Day Convocation Program February 23, 2000)</p><citation>From the guide to the Rally Day Files RG 80., 1885-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>As an institution Smith College has many traditions, some with history since its inception. One of the earliest special days celebrated at Smith College was Ivy Day. Still celebrated, Ivy Day is a day in which departing seniors plant ivy cuts on the Smith grounds, symbolizing their seed of knowledge, in hopes that it will flourish. Today, cuts are taken from vines around campus and given to first-year students in anticipation of their own Ivy Day celebration.</p><p>Many of those traditions include Special Day celebrations for students, staff, faculty, and parents. Included in the Special Days boxes are the Father's Day folders containing programs, POPS! concert programs, photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings. The change from Father's Weekend to Parent's Weekend and then Family Weekend is documented with the information contained in these folders.</p><p>Halloween, Thanksgiving, Easter, Float Night are special days included within the folders. And the repertoire of special days continues to grow as Smith College adds new special day traditions to its old ones: Celebration of Sisterhood and Otelia Cromwell Day. Each celebration seeks to acknowledge and diversify, celebrating what is present and what is to come. Smith College, having a history of celebrating, embracing, renewing and creating traditions, will carry several of them into the future and create several more.</p><citation>From the guide to the Special Days A-Z Files RG 80., 1884-[ongoing], (Smith College Archives)</citation><p>\"Published when the spirit moves\", Campus Cat was a publication created by Smith students in 1918. Its contents provided information to the campus about going-ons, events, activities, and poked fun at the rituals, trials, and stresses of academia and life on the Smith campus. It was a popular publication, provoking many other related publications such as Freshman Eti-Cat and the Campus Cat-alogue, among others.</p><p>The Campus Cat was written by a group of students whose sarcasm and wit are clearly evident in each issue of the publication. It was a highly coveted publication and to be included in the group of Campus Cat writers was to hold a position of prestige. The publication ceased in 1929.</p><p>However, in 1949, students brought the Cat back. The Campus Cat was now funded by the college. Each issue, of which there were four a year, was bound in program form. Again, to write for it was to hold a position of prestige.

His family later moved to New York City, where Hamburger was educated in the public schools. He received a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University (1935) and a M.S. from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism (1938). In 1939 he joined the staff of The New Yorker, where he worked for virtually his entire career.</p><p>Hamburger left the magazine briefly from 1941-1943, when he served as a writer in the U.S. government's Office of Facts and Figures and Office of War Information. He then rejoined The New Yorker, and during 1945 was the magazine's European war correspondent. During the 1950s-1990s, Hamburger contributed essays to nearly every section of The New Yorker, including Talk of the Town, Profiles, A Reporter at Large, and Onward and Upward with the Arts . He was the magazine's music critic from 1948-1949, and wrote its television column from 1949-1955. His popular Notes for a Gazetteer essays chronicled his visits to over fifty American cities during the years 1959-1964. Several pieces from this series were collected and published as An American Notebook (1965). Other collections of Hamburger's New Yorker writings include The Oblong Blur and Other Odysseys (1949), Mayor Watching and Other Pleasures (1958), Our Man Stanley (1963) and Curious World (1987). In 1952 Hamburger published J.P. Marquand, Esq., an acclaimed biography based on his New Yorker profile of the American novelist.</p><p>Philip Hamburger married the writer Edith Iglauer in 1942. The couple had two sons, Richard and Jay. They divorced in 1966. Hamburger married Anna Walling Matson in 1968.</p><citation>From the guide to the Philip Hamburger papers, 1924-2004, 1942-1991, (The New York Public Library.

After graduation, Armsey worked in the Public Information Office of the University of Illinois Professional Colleges. After a year at this post, Armsey went on to serve five years as the Public Relations Director at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This experience prepared him to serve as assistant to the chancellor at NYU beginning in 1952. During his four years at NYU, Armsey would hold several positions. Besides being Assistant to the Chancellor, Armsey was also the head of Public Relations, and the Vice President and Director of the New York University Press. He was an administrator for the Challenge, a newspaper, and he also had ties to the Alumni Bulletin, Alumni News, and the NYU Daily Bulletin . Armsey was also involved in the community, a member of the Community Planning Board #2, helping to clean up the Washington Square area, while at the same time acquiring sites for buildings to expand the Washington Square campus. During Armsey's time at NYU, Henry T. Heald was Chancellor. Heald had been President of the Illinois Institute of Technology, and when he was appointed Chancellor of NYU, he brought Armsey to New York with him to be his assistant. After his tenure at NYU, Heald became president of the Ford Foundation, and Armsey left to work with him there.</p><p>Sources Hevesi, Dennis. \"James Armsey Dies at 90, Oversaw College Grants\", The New York Times, November 19, 2008</p><citation>From the guide to the Records of the Office of the Assistant to the Chancellor/President (James W.

WorldCat record id: 270671960</citation><p>Born on January 10, 1910 in Lyon, the French conductor and composer, Jean Martinon entered the Lyon and Paris conservatoires to study the violin. At Lyon, his teacher was Maurice Foundray and at the Paris Conservatory, he studied violin technique with Jules Boucherit. While at the Paris conservatory, Martinon took composition with Albert Roussel and Vincent d'Indy. After completing the composition courses, he studied conducting with Charles Munch and Désormière. He graduated from the Paris Conservatory in 1928, winning a premier prix.</p><p>Martinon's familiarity with conducting started in France, followed by various appointments in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. In 1946, he embarked on a conducting career directing the Concerts du Conservatoire in Paris and the Bordeaux Symphony. The successful debut with the LPO led to his appointment as associate conductor of the orchestra in 1947. From 1947-1950 Martinon directed the Radio Eireann orchestra, Dublin and in 1951, he returned to Paris to conduct the Concerts Lamoureux until 1957. From 1957-1959, Martinon conducted the Israel Philharmonic. His appointment as the next conductor of the Düsseldorf Symphony occurred in 1959. Martinon was in Düsseldorf until 1963 when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra selected him as their music director, a position he held until 1968. During that same year, he returned to France to direct the French National Radio Orchestra and served as the principal conductor of the Hague Residentie–Orkest from 1974 until shortly before his death in 1976.</p><p>Martinon's extensive experience as a composer led to his approach to conducting. The Symphoniette pour orchestre á cordes, piano, harpe et timbales, op. 16, from 1935, is one of three first attempts at composition. After enlisting in the war, Martinon's imprisonment in a German camp, Stalag IX A, resulted in several new compositions, Psaume 136, le Chant des Captifs, Musique d'Exil, Sonatina No.3, Sonatina No. 4 for wind instruments, and various choral works. In 1946, the city of Paris awarded a prize to his composition le Chant des Captifs. After the war, other notable compositions include Symphonie no. 3 (Irlandaise), the Concerto no. 2 pour violin et orchestre, op. 5, dedicated to Szeryng, and the Concerto pour cello et orchestre, op. 52, composed for Pierre Fournier. For the stage Martinon composed two works, the ballet Ambohimanga ou la Cité Bleue and in 1949 the opera Hécube with a libretto by Serge Moreux. Symphony no.4 Altitudes was the outcome of a commission from the Chicago Symphony to commemorate its 75th anniversary.</p><p>Martinon had recently taken on a position at the Paris Conservatory to teach conducting when he died from a serious illness on March 1, 1976.</p><citation>From the guide to the Jean Martinon papers, 1923-1994, (Music Library)</citation></biogHist>",

In 1936, it was producing about 45 programs per week, 95% of which were educational and 5% of which were entertainment. Its program types were 50% music, 33% speaking, 10% dramatics, and 7% miscellaneous. That year, it also added academic courses taught by university professors and engineering lectures given by university students to its radio lineup. It was also one of the largest non-commercial stations in the U.S. at the time. In 1939, it reported that radio dramas were a major piece of its overall operations. In 1941, WNAD applied for an additional frequency so that it could broadcast all day instead of sharing its time with other stations. By 1947, WNAD had an estimated 500,000 listeners and launched the Oklahoma School of the Air to formalize its educational programs. <citation> From the combined records of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), held by the University of Maryland and the Wisconsin Historical Society, and compiled as part of the Unlocking the Airwaves project (unlockingtheairwaves.org).</citation></p>",

Topaz established \"The Optometric Weekly\" in 1910 and founded The Professional Press, Inc. in 1919. He was the publisher of numerous books in the field of visual optics and a close friend of Charles Sheard, author, researcher and educator for whom Ohio State's Sheard Foundation for Research in Vision is named. Topaz died in Chicago, Illinois on July 23, 1942.</p><p>The Lionel Topaz Memorial Library of Visual Science was dedicated October 31, 1955. The library was located in the Optometry Building on W. Tenth Ave., behind Hamilton Hall. The building was partly financed through a development fund started by Lionel's children, who sought to erect a memorial to their father. The fund also received contributions by the optometrists of the state and nation on a campaign which raised $106,000 toward the library's cost.</p><p>In 1987, due to cost increases and difficulty in maintaining a current optometry collection, the Lionel Topaz Memorial Library of Visual Science merged with the Health Sciences Library. Although several reference books were left in Fry Hall at the request of faculty to maintain a reading room collection, approximately 4,000 volumes were moved to the Health Sciences Library. This collection of unique optometry books was added to the Coleman Alcove, the rare book collection of the Health Sciences Library housed in the Medical Heritage Center.

    "description": "<biogHist><p>Robert K. Merton was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Temple Univ. in 1931. Merton went on to graduate school at Harvard where he received his Ph.D. in 1936. Merton went on to teach at Columbia Univ. and published numerous books including; Social theory and social structure, and Sociology of science.</p><citation>From the description of Letters-Manuscript, 1930-1952. (Temple University Libraries). WorldCat record id: 122628275</citation><p>Robert K. Merton was one of the most influential 20th-century sociologists. His work shaped the discipline for more than a half century. A prolific writer, editor, teacher, and scholar, Merton examined a broad variety of topics from a sociological perspective while developing concepts and theories aimed at linking particular phenomena to more general social patterns. Well known for identifying and analyzing self-fulfilling prophecies, unanticipated consequences, influentials, and role models, Merton significantly contributed to sociological thought through extensive writings, studies, lectures, and research projects. While most of Merton's career was spent at Columbia University, defining the Sociology Department and the Bureau of Applied Social Research, he was also affiliated with a wide range of professional and scholarly organizations.</p><p>Merton was born Meyer R. Schkolnick on July 4, 1910 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The second of two children, he was the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. From an early age, Merton spent countless hours at the local Carnegie library where he developed broad interests in literature; particularly biographies, science, and history. In his early teens Merton formed an interest in magic and wrote a high school paper on the magician Harry Houdini. In the course of his research, he discovered that performing artists often Americanized their names. Following suit, he chose Robert Merton as his stage name; Robert, derived from the French magician Robert Houdin (whom Harry Houdini took his last name), and Merton, a version of Merlin the wizard. The middle initial stands for King, but was always abbreviated by Merton. Encouraged by his brother-in-law, Charles Hopkins, he became a skilled magician, doing an array of magic tricks as well as sleight of hand.</p><p>Upon graduation from South Philadelphia High School, Robert K. Merton attended Temple University on a scholarship. While at Temple he encountered George E. Simpson, a young sociology instructor, who recruited Merton to be his research assistant. The assistantship, coupled with Simpson's lectures, sealed Merton's interest in the field of sociology.</p><p>Through Simpson, Merton met Pitirim Sorokin, founder of the Sociology Department at Harvard University. After receiving a B.A. from Temple in 1931, Merton attended Harvard, claiming Sorokin's deep interest in European sociology was his only reason for choosing the university at the time. In addition to Sorokin, he also cited Talcott Parsons, E.F. Gay, and George Sarton as strong influences on his development while at Harvard. Merton received his M.A. (1932) and his Ph. D. (1936) from Harvard and went on to become an instructor in the University's Sociology Department until 1939.</p><p>At Harvard University, Merton's experiences steered the course of his sociological pursuits. While serving as research assistant to Sorokin, Merton wrote his first published paper, \"Recent French Sociology\" in 1934, which led him to the work of Emile Durkheim and formed the basis for what would become Merton's \"own mode of structural and functional analysis.\" Merton's interest in science and technology grew as he attended a course taught by economic historian E.F. Gay, worked with Sorokin on a joint paper on \"Arabian Intellectual Development,\" and encountered George Sarton, the father of the then nascent discipline, the history of science. Sarton greatly influenced Merton's scholarly development and their association, which Merton called an \"unruly apprenticeship,\" lasted 25 years.</p><p>Merton's dissertation, on the reciprocal connections between science and society, focused specifically on the role Puritanism took in encouraging the rise of science and showed, counter to ideas prevalent at the time, that religion could stimulate and canalize rather than undermine scientific activity. His dissertation, Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England, published in 1938, is widely viewed as the first work in the sociology of science and continues to stimulate research on the origins of modern science. Merton is considered to be the founder of this branch of sociology.</p><p>In 1939 Merton moved to New Orleans and became Associate Professor in Tulane University's Sociology Department, later becoming the department chair. In 1941 Merton accepted an Assistant Professor position in the Sociology Department at Columbia University, which would serve as his academic home for the next four decades.</p><p>At Columbia, Merton was a member of the Department of Sociology while concurrently serving as the Associate Director of the Bureau of Applied Social Research, a post he held from 1942-1971. From 1963-1974, he was the Giddings Professor of Sociology and from 1974-1979, he was named to a University Professorship. In 1979 he held the titles of both Special Service Professor and University Professor Emeritus. Merton officially retired from teaching in 1984, but maintained active ties with Columbia University. In 1990, Columbia established the R.K. Merton Professorship in the Social Sciences.</p><p>Sociology was a growing discipline during Merton's years at Columbia and much of his work influenced the development of the field. Among his most well-known contributions were his analysis of manifest and latent functions, theories of the middle range, social structure and anomie, bureaucratic structure and personality, the sociology of knowledge, including the varying perspectives of outsiders and insiders, and opportunity structures. He also examined a wide variety of subjects from a sociological perspective, including science, formal organizations, media, friendship, and deviant behavior and its sources. His interest in the sociology of science took a new turn in the late 1950s when he turned to studies of the allocation of recognition for scientific discoveries and the reward system of science, in which competition for priority plays a major role. In the decades which followed, he pursued his work on multiple independent discoveries, and their implications for the development of knowledge, priority, and the Matthew effect.</p><p>Merton's involvement with the Bureau of Applied Social Research spanned nearly 30 years. The Bureau was established a year before Merton arrived at Columbia, with Paul F. Lazarsfeld at the helm. The working relationship that developed between Lazarsfeld and Merton was one of the most significant in Merton's career and one that Merton referred to as an \"improbable collaboration.\" While their interests and methods of inquiry differed, they proved to be complementary. Lazarsfeld was known as a methodologist while Merton was the social theorist. Pinpointing their influence on each other over the course of three decades is difficult. However, one of Merton's best known contributions, the focused group interview (which later was transmuted into \"focus groups\"), was brought about by Lazarsfeld's insistence on developing well- articulated research methodologies.</p><p>At the Bureau, Merton and Lazarsfeld trained scores of students and colleagues in social research, and produced major sociological studies on the media, mass communication, mixed race housing communities, and professions. Merton published several books related to these studies including, Mass Persuasion (1946), Reader in Bureaucracy (1952), The Student- Physician (1957), Patterns in Social Life: Explorations in the Sociology of Housing (1951), and The Focused Interview (1956).</p><p>In this same period, Merton's lectures on sociological theory drew scores of students not only from the sociology department but also from departments of history, anthropology, and economics. Courses included Analysis of Social Structure, History of Theory, and Selected Problems in the Theory of Organizations. In conjunction with his studies at the Bureau, Merton also led seminars on the Professions in Modern Society, the Sociological Study of Medical Schools, and the Social Organization of Housing Communities. His commitment to the sociology of science developed further in a seminar of the same name which Merton co-taught with Harriet Zuckerman. As teacher and dissertation advisor, he influenced generations of leading sociologists. These included James Coleman, Peter Blau, Seymour Martin Lipset, Lewis and Rose Coser, Alvin Gouldner, Alice Kitt Rossi, Raymond Boudon, Gary Runciman, Cynthia Epstein, Stephen Cole, Jonathan Cole, and Harriet Zuckerman.</p><p>All apart from his teaching, Merton was a productive scholar and editor. In addition to serving on various editorial boards for scholarly publications, as varied as Britannica International Encyclopedia and ISIS, he also edited vast numbers of manuscripts by students and colleagues. By Merton's own estimate, he edited 2,000 articles and 250 books. His own writings include over 175 published articles and nearly 30 books, as well as numerous book reviews, forwards, introductions, and compilations.</p><p>Many of the well-known theories and concepts Merton created are reflected in his published articles, including \"The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action\" (1936), \"The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy\" (1948), \"Social Structure and Anomie\" (1938), \"Insiders and Outsiders\" (1972), and \"Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science\" (1957). Merton's notable books include Social Theory and Social Structure (1949; 1957 and 1968 enlarged edition), Contemporary Social Problems (with Robert Nisbet) (1961), and The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations (1973), and The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity (2003).</p><p>A fastidious and tireless scholar, Merton devoted long hours to study and research. He was known to sleep very little, and often noted the early morning hour in his letters. Owing to his meticulous note taking and organization of research materials, he revisited earlier themes and ideas, revised and restructured his writing. He also put many projects aside being dissatisfied with the work he had done and completed them only decades later.

WorldCat record id: 436206178</citation><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Robert K. Merton was one of the most influential sociologists whose work shaped the discipline in the mid-to-late 20th century. A prolific writer, editor, teacher, and scholar, Merton examined a broad variety of topics from a sociological perspective while developing concepts and theories aimed at linking particular phenomena to more general social patterns. Well known for identifying and analyzing self-fulfilling prophecies, unanticipated consequences, influentials, and role models, Merton significantly contributed to sociological thought through extensive writings, studies, lectures, and research projects. While most of Merton's career was spent at Columbia University, defining the Sociology Department and the Bureau of Applied Social Research, he was also affiliated with a wide range of professional and scholarly organizations.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Merton was born Meyer R. Schkolnick on July 4, 1910 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The second of two children, he was the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. From an early age, Merton spent countless hours at the local Carnegie library where he developed broad interests in literature; particularly biographies, science, and history. In his early teens Merton formed an interest in magic and wrote a high school paper on the magician Harry Houdini. In the course of his research, he discovered that performing artists often Americanized their names. Following suit, he chose Robert Merton as his stage name; Robert, derived from the French magician Robert Houdin (whom Harry Houdini took his last name), and Merton, a version of Merlin the wizard. The middle initial stands for King, but was always abbreviated by Merton. Encouraged by his brother-in-law, Charles Hopkins, he became a skilled magician, doing an array of magic tricks as well as sleight of hand.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Upon graduation from South Philadelphia High School, Robert K. Merton attended Temple University on a scholarship. While at Temple he encountered George E. Simpson, a young sociology instructor, who recruited Merton to be his research assistant. The assistantship, coupled with Simpson's lectures, sealed Merton's interest in the field of sociology.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Through Simpson, Merton met Pitirim Sorokin, founder of the Sociology Department at Harvard University. After receiving a B.A. from Temple in 1931, Merton attended Harvard, claiming Sorokin's deep interest in European sociology was his only reason for choosing the university at the time. In addition to Sorokin, he also cited Talcott Parsons, E.F. Gay, and George Sarton as strong influences on his development while at Harvard. Merton received his M.A. (1932) and his Ph.D. (1936) from Harvard and went on to become an instructor in the University's Sociology Department until 1939.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED At Harvard University, Merton's experiences steered the course of his sociological pursuits. While serving as research assistant to Sorokin, Merton wrote his first published paper, \"Recent French Sociology\" in 1934, which led him to the work of Emile Durkheim and formed the basis for what would become Merton's \"own mode of structural and functional analysis.\" Merton's interest in science and technology grew as he attended a course taught by economic historian E.F. Gay, worked with Sorokin on a joint paper on \"Arabian Intellectual Development,\" and encountered George Sarton, the father of the then nascent discipline, the history of science. Sarton greatly influenced Merton's scholarly development and their association, which Merton called an \"unruly apprenticeship,\" lasted 25 years.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Merton's dissertation, on the reciprocal connections between science and society, focused specifically on the role Puritanism took in encouraging the rise of science and showed, counter to ideas prevalent at the time, that religion could stimulate and canalize rather than undermine scientific activity. His dissertation, Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England, published in 1938, is widely viewed as the first work in the sociology of science and continues to stimulate research on the origins of modern science. Merton is considered to be the founder of this branch of sociology.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED In 1939 Merton moved to New Orleans and became Associate Professor in Tulane University's Sociology Department, later becoming the department chair. In 1941 Merton accepted an Assistant Professor position in the Sociology Department at Columbia University, which would serve as his academic home for the next four decades.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED At Columbia, Merton was a member of the Department of Sociology while concurrently serving as the Associate Director of the Bureau of Applied Social Research, a post he held from 1942-1971. From 1963-1974, he was the Giddings Professor of Sociology and from 1974-1979, he was named to a University Professorship. In 1979 he held the titles of both Special Service Professor and University Professor Emeritus. Merton officially retired from teaching in 1984, but maintained active ties with Columbia University. In 1990, Columbia established the R.K. Merton Professorship in the Social Sciences.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Sociology was a growing discipline during Merton's years at Columbia and much of his work influenced the development of the field. Among his most well-known contributions were his analysis of manifest and latent functions, theories of the middle range, social structure and anomie, bureaucratic structure and personality, the sociology of knowledge, including the varying perspectives of outsiders and insiders, and opportunity structures. He also examined a wide variety of subjects from a sociological perspective, including science, formal organizations, media, friendship, and deviant behavior and its sources. His interest in the sociology of science took a new turn in the late 1950s when he turned to studies of the allocation of recognition for scientific discoveries and the reward system of science, in which competition for priority plays a major role. In the decades which followed, he pursued his work on multiple independent discoveries, and their implications for the development of knowledge, priority, and the Matthew effect.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Merton's involvement with the Bureau of Applied Social Research spanned nearly 30 years. The Bureau was established a year before Merton arrived at Columbia, with Paul F. Lazarsfeld at the helm. The working relationship that developed between Lazarsfeld and Merton was one of the most significant in Merton's career and one that Merton referred to as an \"improbable collaboration.\" While their interests and methods of inquiry differed, they proved to be complementary. Lazarsfeld was known as a methodologist while Merton was the social theorist. Pinpointing their influence on each other over the course of three decades is difficult. However, one of Merton's best known contributions, the focused group interview (which later was transmuted into \"focus groups\"), was brought about by Lazarsfeld's insistence on developing well- articulated research methodologies.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED At the Bureau, Merton and Lazarsfeld trained scores of students and colleagues in social research, and produced major sociological studies on the media, mass communication, mixed race housing communities, and professions. Merton published several books related to these studies including, Mass Persuasion (1946), Reader in Bureaucracy (1952), The Student- Physician (1957), Patterns in Social Life: Explorations in the Sociology of Housing (1951), and The Focused Interview (1956).</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED In this same period, Merton's lectures on sociological theory drew scores of students not only from the sociology department but also from departments of history, anthropology, and economics. Courses included Analysis of Social Structure, History of Theory, and Selected Problems in the Theory of Organizations. In conjunction with his studies at the Bureau, Merton also led seminars on the Professions in Modern Society, the Sociological Study of Medical Schools, and the Social Organization of Housing Communities. His commitment to the sociology of science developed further in a seminar of the same name which Merton co-taught with Harriet Zuckerman. As teacher and dissertation advisor, he influenced generations of leading sociologists. These included James Coleman, Peter Blau, Seymour Martin Lipset, Lewis and Rose Coser, Alvin Gouldner, Alice Kitt Rossi, Raymond Boudon, Gary Runciman, Cynthia Epstein, Stephen Cole, Jonathan Cole, and Harriet Zuckerman.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Apart from his teaching, Merton was a productive scholar and editor. In addition to serving on various editorial boards for scholarly publications, as varied as Britannica International Encyclopedia and ISIS, he also edited vast numbers of manuscripts by students and colleagues. By Merton's own estimate, he edited 2,000 articles and 250 books. His own writings include over 175 published articles and nearly 30 books, as well as numerous book reviews, forwards, introductions, and compilations.</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED Many of the well-known theories and concepts Merton created are reflected in his published articles, including \"The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action\" (1936), \"The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy\" (1948), \"Social Structure and Anomie\" (1938), \"Insiders and Outsiders\" (1972), and \"Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science\" (1957). Merton's notable books include Social Theory and Social Structure (1949; 1957 and 1968 enlarged edition), Contemporary Social Problems (with Robert Nisbet) (1961), and The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations (1973), and The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity (2003).</p><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED A fastidious and tireless scholar, Merton devoted long hours to study and research. He was known to sleep very little, and often noted the early morning hour in his letters. Owing to his meticulous note taking and organization of research materials, he revisited earlier themes and ideas, revised and restructured his writing. He also put many projects aside being dissatisfied with the work he had done and completed them only decades later. Merton was a lover of language and embarked on projects to analyze words and their origins, from a historical and sociological perspective, the best known being the aphorism \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" Merton's journey to discover the phrases' origins led to the publication of On the Shoulders of Giants: a Shandean Postscript in 1965.

WorldCat record id: 45206996</citation><p>Henry Cowell (1897-1965) was an American composer, writer, pianist, educator, lecturer, and publisher.</p><p>Initially schooled at home by his mother, Clarissa Dixon Cowell, he began music studies as a child in the San Francisco Bay area. Among his earliest mentors were Charles Seeger, with whom he began studying in 1914 at the University of California at Berkeley and the Irish Theosophist poet John Varian. Following a stint in the army in 1918-1919 and further study, Cowell embarked on an extensive series of tours throughout the United States, Europe, as well as the USSR, performing his own music and attracting publicity for his use of tone clusters and experimental keyboard techniques. A tireless advocate for contemporary music, Cowell formed the New Music Society of California, helping to promote such composers as Charles Ives, Carlos Chávez, John Becker, Carl Ruggles and Wallingford Riegger through the quarterly journal, New Music. Cowell's music defined many of the major developments of twentieth-century music, and he was among the earliest composers to endorse the view that the musical materials of the whole world, not just Western Europe, should be available to composers and inform their musical and cultural outlook. To this end, he studied comparative musicology in Berlin early on and he would continue these explorations with his wife, ethnomusicologist Sidney Robertson Cowell, (who, along with his stepmother Olive Cowell and composer Percy Grainger were instrumental in helping Cowell to gain early release from his imprisonment on a morals charge). Cowell taught at many institutions, most notably the New School for Social Research, where his students included John Cage and Lou Harrison. He also was a prolific writer, whose output included the books, New Musical Resources (1930), an exploration of modern compositional methods, and Charles Ives and his Music (1955), the first monograph about the composer (co-written with his wife).</p><citation>From the description of Henry Cowell papers, 1851-1994. (New York Public Library). WorldCat record id: 84671665</citation><p>Henry Cowell (March 11, 1897 - Dec. 10, 1965) was an American composer, writer, pianist, educator, lecturer and publisher. He was born to a poor family in Menlo Park, California, near San Francisco; Menlo Park remained his home until 1936. Cowell was mainly schooled at home by his mother and began his music studies at age five on the violin; he switched to piano within a few years and began composing around the time he was 10. Lewis Terman, a psychologist at Stanford University, began studying Cowell as an example of a child genius and used him as a case study subject for the development of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Another Stanford professor, Samuel Seward, arranged a fund to educate Cowell and to assist his family. Cowell began studying with Charles Seeger, among others, at the University of California at Berkeley in 1914. Another mentor Cowell met in his teens was the Irish Theosophist poet John Varian, whose texts Cowell set to music. Later in his life Cowell studied with musicians from non-western cultures to learn about their music.</p><p>Following a stint in the army in 1918-1919, Cowell concentrated on performing his own music. He began touring the United States and visited Europe for the first time in 1923, attracting publicity for his use of tone clusters and direct manipulation of piano strings; he drew more substantial interest from European composers such as Bela Bartók and Arnold Schoenberg.</p><p>In addition to his own musical activities, Cowell was a tireless advocate, publisher and presenter for other contemporary composers, most notably Charles Ives, but also for his friends John Becker, Carl Ruggles and Wallingford Riegger, among others. He formed the New Music Society of California, and was a major player in the Pan American Association of Composers, which helped publicize such composers as Carlos Chavez. Cowell also established the brand name New Music, a quarterly journal which also branched out into a record label and score publishing concern.</p><p>Cowell taught at many institutions during his life, most notably the New School for Social Research, but also at Columbia University, Eastman School of Music, Stanford University and the University of California. He wrote books, including New Musical Resources, an exploration of modern compositional methods, and Charles Ives And His Music, the first book about Ives (written with Sidney Robertson Cowell). Cowell also toured the world meeting other musicians and composers to facilitate intercultural exchange, at times under the sponsorship of the U.S. State Department and the Rockefeller Foundation</p><p>Cowell's music defined many of the major developments of twentieth-century music, and he was among the earliest composers to endorse the view that the musical materials of the whole world, not just Western Europe, should be available to composers and inform their musical and cultural outlook. In many ways his music and philosophy both exemplified and anticipated the musical aesthetics of the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries.</p><p>Source: Nicholls, David. \"Cowell, Henry (Dixon)\", Grove Music Online ed.

He systematized the clusters as harmonic amplifications of tonal chords, and devised logical notation for them.

The AM station was founded by students from the Electrical Engineering department. The station was licensed to broadcast at a wavelength of 485 meters at a power of 750 watts. Later, the station operated on 1200 kilohertz at a power of 100 watts. The station's call-letters, WCAT, were an abbreviation for \"Wildcat Radio.\" Originally, the studios were located in the basement of the Administration building. In 1928, the studios were moved to the third floor of the Prep Building. During the time that WCAT was on the air, the AM station's programming ranged from news to sports and music. In 1952, WCAT was forced to leave the airwaves as a result of pressure from a commercial radio station.</p>",

Before World War I was over, these four educators were joined by others and the Emergency Council on Education was created. This fledgling organization, with an annual budget of two thousand dollars, soon shed its wartime nature and changed its name to the American Council on Education. From 1918, ACE has steadily increased in size and stature in American higher education.</p><p>How ACE became one of the pre-eminent institutions in higher education during its history is reflected in its archives. This aggregate of the permanent, noncurrent records documents the various goals, programs and accomplishments of the council between 1918 and 1977. Just as the Council had dropped its transitory name in 1918, to one more appropriate for a permanent organization, an archives of an organization does not include all the records created or received by it during its existence. Most records of an organization are of a temporary nature and, once their current use is over, can be destroyed because the purpose for their existence is satisfied. During the arrangement and description project just concluded, records of a non-current nature were appraised as to their value and either blessed as archives or destroyed. Over half of the records accumulated by the Council were either duplicates, publications, or simply not judged to be of permanent value.</p><p>This descriptive inventory of the ACE Archives provides the membership of the Council, the staff of the Council, and interested researchers, a means to use the almost three hundred linear feet of permanent records constituting the archives. Because of the Council's central role in directing American higher education over the last sixty years, a brief historical sketch of significant events documented in the archives follows. This is by no means intensive or extensive and is meant only to highlight some of the educational issues ACE and its members have faced in the twentieth century.</p><p>World War I not only thrust the United States into a leadership position in world affairs but also brought out the lack of vocational education training and universal military training in the United States. These issues, as well as the exchange of students between American and foreign educational institutions in Europe, occupied the Council. Because the institution was the central coordinating organization of other educational associations and individual members, building a membership and remaining financially sound were vital activities and occupied a great amount of energy of Donald J. Cowling and Samuel P. Capen, the first two directors of the Council. As chief executives of the Council, these two individuals felt it their responsibility for reporting to the membership proposed higher education legislation. Capen, as the second director, established a quarterly publication, the Educational Record in 1920, in order to report to the Council membership pertinent issues and activities. This publication has served a vital need in higher education, and for over fifty years has summarized the activities of the committees and commissions of ACE. From its early history to the present, committees and commissions have been central to the accomplishments of the Council. Because the commissions and committees created and maintained their records separate from the records of the Office of the Director, they are retained in that manner in the ACE Archives. The records of commissions and committees created during the tenure of Cowling were not broken in 1919 when Capen became director and can be located in the office records of the latter.</p><p>The quantity of records created during the tenures of Cowling and Capen is quite small, however that is not unusual when considerations are made for a Council staff of one or two employees. In addition, much of the correspondence of committee members would be maintained among the papers of these university administrators and professors.</p><p>If Cowling and Capen were the copilots in getting the Council off the ground, the third director of the organization was responsible for guiding it through its first decade of growth. Charles Riborg Mann directed the Council between 1922 and 1934. Man reflected his times when he opposed federal funding for higher education. Just as strongly, he promoted the use of standardized testing by use of a standardized psychological test. In 1927 this test was administered to 64,000 freshmen in 188 colleges and universities. Over the next fifty years, the diagnostic value of this examination as an addition to secondary school grades became standard in American education. During his tenure the council began publishing what today is the Handbook of American Colleges and Universities. Not all efforts of the council ended in success. The chair of the committee on Federal Relations reported in 1925 that seven years of efforts to promote the creation of a Federal Department of Education was unsuccessful. The committee reported \"the termination of the 68th Congress and than God.\" In April 1929, President Herbert Hoover established the National Advisory committee on Education and named Mann as chairman. Four other members of the Executive Committee of the council were appointed to this presidential committee. Much of the committee's activities can be followed in the archives of the Council.</p><p>When Director Man resigned in 1934, the former U.S. Commissioner of Education, George F. Zook, was appointed executive. With membership of the Council declining because of the depression, Zook and the Executive Committee reduced Council dues from $100 to $50. Also the Constitution was amended to rename the chief executive the president rather than the director.</p><p>In 1936, the Council announced the formation of the American Youth Commission and elected former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker as chairman. During most of the depression, about four out of ten unemployed workers were American youth. The records of the Commission document noteworthy achievements of the commission in relating to the harsh realities faced by American youth. Such Council publications as Growing Up in the Black Belt and Youth and the Future had a significant impact on how Americans viewed their youth.</p><p>Anticipating wartime needs, the Council began publication of Higher Education and National Defense in 1940. Later, this publication was renamed Higher Education and National Affairs and is prominent today in the literature of higher education. During World War II the Council was frustrated because no overall higher education plan met the approval of the War Department. In various ways the Council and its new Committee of Relationship of Higher Education to the Federal Government cooperated with government agencies. The government request to conserve paper reduced the size of the Educational Record and the amount of records created by the Council. Remembering that many colleges and universities granted blanket credit for military experience in World War I, the council published 50,000 copies of a pamphlet, Sound Educational Credit for Military Experience. At the conclusion of the war, the Council established the Veterans Testing Service, which was later renamed the General Educational Development Testing Service. During its existence the Service tested almost three million adults.</p><p>In 1945 and 1946, Dr. Zook's efforts to promote international education and cultural exchange were successful as he and other educators attended the San Francisco Conference. This influence can be seen in the Charter of the United Nations. Zook was also named program chairman of the United States National Commission for UNESCO and continued to campaign for cultural exchange programs. Also in 1946, Zook was named by President Truman as chairman of the President's Commission on Higher Education. Various committees of the Council examined the need for higher education assistance to those returning from the armed services. A special committee was established to study the problems of the more than 123,000 disabled American veterans enrolled on college campuses. A special Council sampling survey of housing for veterans attending classes was performed.</p><p>Upon Zook's retirement in 1950, the American Council on Education moved to its new headquarters and received its new president, Arthur S. Adams. Because of the Korean Conflict, the manpower question occupied the attention of the Council. A special conference on the role of women in the mobilization of human resources was sponsored in New York City. The Executive Committee again voiced objection to a proposed universal military training program then before Congress.</p><p>Major concerns of higher education during the McCarthy Era were the questions of academic freedom and national security. In 1953, the Educational Record published two articles describing infringements on academic freedom at Rutgers and Harvard. The council held two special conferences on the questions of academic freedom and national security. A new Commission on the Education of Women was launched by the Council in 1953.</p><p>As the Council staff increased in the 1950s, the need for a Council library became evident. In 1956 a small staff library was opened with a contribution of $450.</p><p>Spurred by the Russian launching of Sputnik, the Council published A Proposed Program of Federal Action to Strengthen Higher Education in the Service of the Nation. The Council stressed that the nation should improve and strengthen our educational system rather than imitate the Russian model. The Council's Problems and Policies Committee followed by distributing 130,000 copies of its study, Public Understanding and Support of Higher Education. By the 1960s, the professional staff of the Council had expanded and offered the membership more institutional research capability and expertise.</p><p>In 1961 the new president, Logan Wilson, made substantive changes in the organizational structure of the Council. Wilson' goal was to have a small staff of professionals assigned to major areas of council interest. These council offices or divisions were assisted by advisory committees or commissions representing the wide spectrum of Council membership. Within this organizational framework a large number of leaders of American higher education were involved in Council activities. In addition, a publications department and a department of research and analysis were established in the 1960s as service oriented components of the Council. Although new divisions or operations were created and others expanded or reduced in size, the basic organizational structure introduced by Wilson still stands. From the 1960s, the Council, and higher education in general, has paid greater attention to the federal government's impact on higher education. Today, almost all operating units of the Council are aware of the influence of government in the higher education enterprise.</p><p>Logan Wilson's talents stretched far beyond organizational management. He brought about creation of a Committee of Educational Opportunity which addressed the need for greater opportunities for blacks in higher education. Wilson and other members of the board also directed the Council to look at the urban scene in the 1960s. In that same area, ACE influenced the Higher Education Act of 1965 by urging direct financial assistance for needy and able students. These came to be known as \"opportunity grants.\" In 1969 the ACE annual meeting theme, \"The Campus and Racial Tension,\" was proposed by the staff director of the Office of Research. During this period, the commission on Acadmic Affairs published ACE Special Reports relating to the needs of black America.</p><p>Despite the ferment in the 1960s on American campuses, overseas assistance to newly established African educational institutions was carried out through the Council's Africa Liaison Committee, established in 1959. Most of the committee's early efforts were directed toward sub-Sahara Africa. In 1965 the committee was renamed the Overseas Liaison Committee and expanded its activities into the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean areas. The activities and accomplishments in assisting educational institutions in these areas are fully documented in the records of the committee.</p><p>After a decade of service as president of the Council, Logan Wilson was succeeded in 1972 by Roger W. Heyns. The new president focused on federal legislation affecting higher education and in achieving a better representation of institutional interests on the Board of the Council. Following intensive study, the Board was expanded to include six new members. Also, to cope with the growing demands of relating higher education and the federal government, Stephen K. Bailey was appointed vice president in charge of all Council activities in governmental relations. The Council interaction with government was evidenced by the presentation of 27 oral or written statements to congressional committees or federal agencies during 1973. Thus, under the leadership of Heyns and Bailey, ACE became more the leader and voice for higher education when new legislation was being considered. The Council staff became more conversant with legislative staffs and provided expertise when needed. When Heyns resigned on May 31, 1977, Bailey became acting president for three months until a successor, J. W. Peltason, assumed the chief executive's position.</p><p>It appears that by both the volume and complexity of Council records pertaining to governmental relations, the ACE has assumed the vital role of articulating and promoting the interests of higher education in the legislative arena.</p><p>This historical sketch, although providing some idea of the documentation available in the archives, is no substitute for a careful study of the descriptive guide of the ACE Archives, 1918-1977, provided in the rest of this document.</p><p>George C.

Crabbe papers, 1949-1991 and undated (bulk 1970-1979) (University of Maryland Libraries). WorldCat record id: 29883325</citation><p>John C. (Crozier) Crabbe, son of Arthur and Louise A. (Wiley) Crabbe, was born on July 3, 1914 in Pomona, California. He attended Modesto (California) College from 1931 to 1934, and then Fresno (California) State College from 1934 to 1936. He finished his Bachelor of Arts degree in theater from the College of the Pacific in 1937 and a MA in 1940. During college, he participated in vaudeville and burlesque theater, mostly as an electrical technician. Crabbe did his postgraduate work at the University of Iowa in 1938, at New York University in 1940, at Stanford University in 1951, and at Ohio State University. On July 17, 1940, he married Bobbin Gay Peck with whom he had three children: John Crozier, William Charles, and Barbara Gay. During World War II, Crabbe served from 1943 to 1946 in the United States Naval Reserve as a lieutenant stationed in Baltimore.</p><p>Crabbe's broadcasting career started on a Fresno, California station reading comics from 1934 to 1935. He then began his career in educational broadcasting while he attended the College of the Pacific, Stockton, California. From 1936 to 1937, he taught and produced radio programs for release on commercial stations. After graduation, Crabbe remained at Pacific as Director of Broadcasting from 1937 to 1958 and as KUOP-FM station manager, having helped put the Stockton, California educational radio station on the air in 1949 . This station started as a campus-limited, carrier-current station as part of a laboratory activity. It was student operated except for Crabbe and one chief engineer, and did live productions of music, ballgames, and dramas. Before KUOP started, the College of the Pacific released student class-produced programs through local commercial stations. In addition, he helped organize the first broadcasting curriculum west of the Mississippi in the 1940s.</p><p>During World War II, while stationed in Baltimore, Crabbe occupied his spare time by lobbying the Federal Communications Commission for FM channels reserved for educational use. The broadcasting industry did not care much about FM, but simply wanted twenty reserved channels. Finally, the FCC granted educational reservations for FM channels in April, 1952.</p><p>Starting in the 1950s, Crabbe's educational broadcasting career involved simultaneous activities in California, Ohio, and Michigan. The biography will now focus on each geographic location separately, starting with California. From 1950 to 1953, Crabbe participated as a member in the Western Radio Television Conference, joining fellow members Jim Day, Public Service Director of San Francisco and Luke Roberts, Public Service Director, KOIN, Portland, Oregon. The conference was first held in San Francisco, and was later held in cities such as Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Portland. Meanwhile, in 1951, at Stanford University, Crabbe lectured in radio education.</p><p>In 1953, Crabbe served as executive secretary of the Delta-Sierra Educational Television Corporation, a Stockton community organization focused on establishing a station on Channel 42. At the same time, a Sacramento community organization, the Northern California Educational Television was trying to establish an educational television station on Channel 6. These two groups met regularly between 1952 and 1957, and eventually merged in 1955 to form a non-profit corporation called Central California Educational Television (CCET). Crabbe served as CCET's Executive Secretary from 1955 to 1958. In October of 1957, a representative from the Fund for Adult Education, an agency of the Ford Foundation, met with Crabbe. The two men agreed that CCET would have ninety days from December 15, 1957 to raise $100,000 in cash plus $100,000 in pledges to qualify for a Fund grant of $100,000. Working out of an office provided by the College of the Pacific, Crabbe spoke to about 92 groups ranging from PTAs and luncheon clubs to special interest associations and raised $115,000 in cash and over $100,000 in pledges. With the money raised, Channel 6, KVIE, Stockton was established on July 1, 1958 and started broadcasting in mid-December 1958. From July 1958 to 1969, Crabbe served as KVIE's general manager.</p><p>In 1961, Crabbe was the manager of Central California ETV, Inc. From 1967 to 1969, Crabbe served as president of the Western Educational Network, was a special consultant in radio education in the schools of central California and was chairman of the Television Advisory Committee of the State of California. From 1967 to July 1968, Crabbe served as vice-president of the Western Radio and Television Association's Western Educational Network, and then succeeded Luke Lamb as president from August 1968 to 1969 when he became chair of communications. Finally, from 1973 to 1974, Crabbe served as consultant to the Joint Committee on Telecommunications of the California Legislature.</p><p>Crabbe's Ohio activities began shortly before 1950 when he directed the Association for Education by Radio at Columbus Ohio. Then, from 1950 to 1953, Crabbe became the president of the Association for Educational Radio-TV (AERT) in Columbus, Ohio, having been its vice president. AERT was a largely teacher, in-school oriented organization, inspired by the School Broadcast Conference of Chicago as a reaction to the institutional orientation of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) . Meanwhile, from 1951 to 1952, he was an assistant at the Office of Radio-Television Education at Ohio State University. In 1952, Crabbe became an assistant to Keith Tyler at the Institute for Education by Radio and Television at Ohio State University. He also put together the Ohio State Institute for Education by Radio and Television Competitions on April 18 - 20, 1952. The following banquet included \"Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie.\"</p><p>Crabbe's broadcasting career in Michigan started in 1953 at the National Music Camp at Interlochen. There, from 1953 to 1954, he served as director of radio/television, taping recitals and board concerts on to 104 miles of audio tape and feeding it to WKAR, East Lansing, Michigan. Then, from 1955 to 1956, he was one of the first Program Associates of Educational Television and Radio Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p><p>During the 1960s and 1970s, Crabbe participated in long-range financing, consulting jobs, and was involved on various educational broadcasting committees and boards. In 1961, along with John Schwarzwalder, he served as a regional consultant on a survey on the need for television channels in education under Title VII of National Defense Education Act. At that time, the Federal Communication Commission's number one priority was to properly allocate television spectrum space. From 1962 to 1964, Crabbe served on the Department Committee of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. Then, in 1964, he worked as a consultant in broadcasting for RTV International (East Africa) in New York. In 1969, Crabbe was also a member of the interim management group for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Network Operation. That year, he received the Banner Award from the Theta Sigma Phi National Professional Society for Women in Journalism and Communications for outstanding contributions in the field of communications. Then, from 1969 to 1973, he was a consultant in public broadcasting.</p><p>He spent his last formal years in educational broadcasting in Colorado. There, from 1976 to 1981, he was the director of telecommunications and general manger of KTSC-TV, University of South Colorado, Pueblo, Colorado, and then its consultant after retirement from 1981 on. Also, he served as Director of the University of Southern Colorado Telecommunications Division in 1981. Other involvement in public broadcasting in that region included serving on the board of directors of the Rocky Mountain Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and on the board of governors of the Pacific Mountain Network. Crabbe also contributed articles to professional publications such as the Journal of the Association of Education by Radio- Television (JAERT) .</p><p>Crabbe's other business activities included a term as the general manager of Tel-Vue Stockton, Inc. in California in 1972, and as an associate at Arthur Bolton Associates from 1972 to 1973.</p><p>John C.

The first national meeting of the National Congress of Mothers (as it was first called) was held in Washington D.C. in February, 1897. In 1908 the name was changed to the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations in an effort to recognize the importance of the parent-teacher partnership. In 1924, the name was changed to the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. In 1950, the group's national headquarters was established in Chicago. The initial focus of the group was on mother/teacher cooperation and child welfare issues. However, as the organization grew and diversified, it supported many other causes including sex education, teacher salary increases, mothers' pension laws, safety, homemaking, adult education, nutrition, anti-drug and -tobacco use, race relations, flouridation of water supplies, and polio prevention.</p><citation>From the description of Records, 1896-1965.

Adams in Gary, Indiana, Betty attended the University of Indiana, and subsequently married physician Leonard J. McKenzie on May 27, 1948. They moved from Madison to Champaign, Illinois around 1956, after which Betty began working at the NAEB. Betty's tenure with the organization showed that she was nearly universally respected by her colleagues and NAEB executives and leadership. During her tenure as Editor, she corresponded with almost every executive, and was in attendance at nearly every major NAEB meeting and convention during the 50s through much of the 1960s, drafting editorial policies and championing the NAEB in her own separate publications. <citation> From the combined records of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), held by the University of Maryland and the Wisconsin Historical Society, and compiled as part of the Unlocking the Airwaves project (unlockingtheairwaves.org).</citation></p>",

Also in 1947, he proposed the NAEB adopt a regional model, in which every U.S. state was divided into one of six regions. This proposal was adopted and became integral to the NAEB's operations over the years. From 1951-1952, Dunn again served on the Board of Directors, and in 1952 was also the Region V Director and the chair of the NAEB Membership Committee.

Fannin later ran two more times and won. As Governor, Fannin worked to attract industry to the state, fought for better schools and the creation of a junior college system. During his tenure, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to allocate the Colorado River between Arizona and California. This decision led to the creation of the Central Arizona Project. In 1959, Fannin created the Arizona Mexico West Coast Trade Commission to facilitate economic and social interaction. Fannin also served as Chairman of the Western Governor's Conference, functioned as a three-term member of the executive committee of the national Governor's Conference, and was a member of the President's Civil Defense Advisory Council from 1963 to 1964.

Influenced by the Futurists and by Pirandello's brand of surrealism, he was primarily a proponent of magic realism, a genre that he allied to Italian fascism. He served as cultural liaison and propagandist for the fascist regime abroad and was the national secretary of the fascist writers' union from 1927 to 1928. After World War II he became a socialist and won a seat in the Italian senate, but the senate nullified the election because of his fascist past.</p><citation>From the description of Bontempelli papers, 1865-1991. (Getty Research Institute). WorldCat record id: 80461371</citation><p><span>Biographical/Historical Note</span></p><p>Massimo Bontempelli was born in 1878, the son of a railroad engineer whose work obliged the family to move frequently. He attended secondary school in Milan and university in Turin, where he graduated in both philosophy and letters. After teaching elementary school for a number of years and failing to win a position teaching Italian in secondary school, he turned to magazine editing in 1910. During WWI he was a war correspondent, reporting from the front, and then an artillery official (1917-1918).</p><p>While teaching elementary school, Bontempelli wrote poetry, stories and plays, producing a new volume every year or two, as he would continue to do for most of his career. After the war he returned to Milan, where he came into contact with the avant-garde and consequently reinvented himself, refuting his previous work and the late 19th century style that had characterized it. At forty years of age, he began editing futurist magazines and writing plays and stories that portrayed bizarre psychological conditions and uncanny situations. Along with the futurists, Pirandello, with whom Bontempelli was close friends, influenced work such as La vita intensa, La scacchiera davanti allo specchio, and Eva ultima .</p><p>In 1926, Bontempelli and Malaparte started the journal '900, Cahiers d'Italie et d'Europe, which was edited by an international group and which served as a venue for such writers as James Joyce, Virigina Woolf, and Blaise Cendrars. In '900 Bontempelli found a forum for his cultural theory, Novecentismo, which posited three stages in human civilization: the first, the classical period, ended with the coming of Christ; the second, the romantic, began with the Sermon on the Mount and ended with WWI; the third, both anti-classical and anti-romantic, was just beginning and would demand the complete political and cultural renewal that Fascism proposed. Bontempelli believed that the role of the writer within the new order should be that of mythographer, the producer of myths and fables for mass society. But while writers should employ \"magic realism\" to inspire readers to acceptance of the new order, they should not submit to control or censorship of their imaginations.</p><p>Bontempelli was the national secretary of the fascist writers' union from 1927-1928; in 1930 he became a member of the Academy of Italy. Until the late 1930s he served, along with his companion Paola Masino, as a cultural liason and propagandist for the fascist regime abroad, lecturing frequently on Italian cultural figures. During this period he also produced his \"mature\" novels and plays ( Il figlio di due madri ; Vita e morte di Adria e i suoi figli ; La fame ; Nembo ) written according to his theories, and became one of the best-selling authors in Italy. In 1938 he came into conflict with the regime over his refusal of a university chair vacated due to application of racial laws. He was expelled from the party and suspended from literary activity for one year. Reinstated, he began writing a popular column for Tempo, entitled \"Colloqui,\" which ran until 1943.</p><p>After WWII, Bontempelli aligned himself with the political left and ran for senator. He won, but the Senate nullified his election because of his fascist past. During the 1950s his health declined along with his literary reputation, despite the publication of a collection of essays on music and one of previously published stories, L'amante fedele, which won the 1953 Strega prize. He died in 1960.</p><citation>From the guide to the Massimo Bontempelli papers, 1865-1991, (Getty Research Institute)</citation></biogHist>",

Just over five months after its establishment, the Searchlight was replaced by the Kent Stater on July 29, 1926. The newspaper took on its current title as the Daily Kent Stater in December of 1953. Today, the Daily Kent Stater is published Monday through Friday during the regular school year, and weekly on Wednesdays during the summer months.

WorldCat record id: 642164811</citation><p>BIOGHIST REQUIRED As an institution and a community, Columbia University completely mobilized its people and resources in order to help the United States and its allies, as well as protect itself from possible enemy attack, during World War II. The war affected the University most directly once the U.S. was involved, but the topic had entered the campus consciousness as early as 1933, when the merits of entering into war were debated on campus by faculty and students alike. By the fall of 1941, with war raging in Europe, it was becoming more and more likely the U.S. would eventually be drawn into the conflict. In response, the University began preparing itself for the contingencies of war, well before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December of that year.</p><p>The University participated in the war effort in several major ways: government-aided research, civilian defense, war relief, and military and educational training programs. Scientific research was conducted both on campus and in laboratories on Long Island and in Connecticut. Columbia engaged in research in the fields of engineering, physics, and medicine, ranging from high profile programs like the Manhattan Project to lesser known projects such as one developing underwater sonar systems. Research conducted during WWII sometimes continued into the post-war period, and new research projects were given to the university as the connections between government agencies and the University begun during the war period continued and grew.</p><p>Two major programs instituted on campus, in addition to the ongoing research in the many labs in and around campus, were Civilian Defense and the Committee for War Relief. Civilian Defense, a domain mainly controlled by men on campus, was comprised of six different committees: Committee on Campus Protection (including the Building Control Division), Committee on Community Education, Committee on Courses of Training, Committee on Protection of Valuable Possessions, Committee on Technical Advice, and Committee on Volunteer Participation. Another important sub-division of the Civilian Defense program was the Student Auxiliary Corps (SAC) comprising five different squads – fire, first aid, campus patrol, information desk and communications. All of these committees used the talents and manpower of those in the campus community to institute defensive measures such as blackout regulations, air raid drills, evacuation procedures, and training in first-aid. The committee also acted as a liaison between Columbia and the larger New York City and metropolitan area communities and their civilian defense programs.</p><p>Committee for War Relief was mainly the domain of women within the Columbia community and acted primarily as a fundraising organization. It raised money through the organization of fairs, concerts and lectures in order to aid people suffering in war torn countries, such as Britain and France. In addition to fundraising, this group also organized volunteers to make surgical dressings, knit socks, organize blood drives and hold lectures on home front activities, such as growing victory gardens.</p><p>Columbia also made its facilities available to the military as a place where thousands of new recruits could be housed and instructed in the United States Naval Reserve (U.S.N.R.) Midshipmen's School, the Navy V-12 program and the U.S. Navy School of Military Government and Administration. Additionally, the university adjusted its coursework within the college and other areas of the school to meet the new needs of wartime. Thus, map-making classes, more engineering courses, speeded up degree programs, and intensive language courses in Japanese and German were instituted.</p><citation>From the guide to the World War II Collection, 1933-1956., (Columbia University.

Due to fear of naval bombardment, the hospital was also meant to handle victims of these bombardments if they occurred or to handle ill soldiers or war disasters. The War Department took over the Hospital on October 3, 1917 and renamed it the U.S. Army General Hospital Number One. In other war efforts, alumni raised enough money in September 1917 to set up the Ambulance Service Division. In addition, the University established the Columbia Service Bureau, part of the American University Union. Horatio S. Krans (CC 1894) headed the Bureau as \"a friendly and helpful port of call for hundreds of Columbia soldiers on leave to Paris.\" (Fon W. Boardman, Jr., Columbia: An American University in Peace and War, p.47)</p><p>The University participated in and created many other programs and facilities to further the war effort, including the emergency training corps; establishment of the Military and Naval Bureau in East Hall; Mobilization Committee for Women's Work which organized women for volunteer and salaried positions; the establishment of the United States Navy Gas Engine School; the inclusion of war-related courses being taught through the Department of Extension Teaching; and the creation of the Farm Bureau.</p><citation>From the guide to the Columbia University in World War I Collection, 1914-1970, (Columbia University.
