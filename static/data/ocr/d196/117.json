It is one used often by a colleague of mine who has contributed\nmuch to refining of polling technique 1 Dr. Ralph 0. Hafstger, director of the\nachool of Journalism at the University of Wisconsin.\n3ut let’s get on to the results of the first poll — the one on Italian\nattitudes toward America and Americans.\nAs its first question, PQXA asked Italians; “Do you have greater sympathy\nfor the British, the Americans* the Germans or the French? And in what order of\npreference would you put thee?**\nFifty six per cent of the Italians polled said they were most sympathetic to\nAmericana. Eighteen per cent listed us in second place; ten percent in third.\nOnly six per cent listed the Americans last* Another ten per cent gave us no\nranking*"
