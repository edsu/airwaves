  "text": "- 2 -\nBy far the knottiest problem of the bunch is the one which seeks to give each\ninterested department of an institution a voice in the affairs of the association©\nI am sure you can all point to examples, particularly in the TV field* Recently\nanother example not in the .TV field came across my desk* We have carried for a\nnumber of years the New York University .Radio Club as an associate member© I now\nhave an application from the Assistant to the Chancellor of New York University\nwhich was filled out at the suggestion of the chancellor© They are applying for\nanother associate membership*\nAs a possible solution, it has been suggested that each institutional membership\nhave perhaps five votes© It would then be up to the institution to divide up these\nvotes among the departments which were active on. its campuso This, in effect, would\nmean that at one institution the radio man might vote all five votes© At another the\nvotes could be split into one for FM, one for AM, one for TV, one for radio teaching,\nand one for a radio clubQ\nIt seems to me that maybe we have the cart before the horse in this matter© An\nassociation is only as strong as the services it performs© Hence, perhaps we ought\nto answer Question #1i before wc do anything else© The services we have now, of\ncourse, ares the News-Letter, the tape network, the meetings and seminars provided\nunder Kellogg financing^ the advice given to new members, and the general exchange\nof information among members©\nI don1t list the above in any derogatory way© I think the services are excellent\nand are, in the main, adequate© But what particular services should be provided to\nTV? And if we go along with teaching units, what should we provide tliem? All of this,\nof course, is tied up with Item #5>, both immediately and in. the future©\nAs far as long range financing is concerned, there are two obvious ways© first, either\nraise the dues or raise the number of members© The second obvious way is to secure\nadditional support from Kellogg or another foundation© A third perhaps less obvious\nway is the \"tape network way\" of providing service on an assessment foe basis©\nThe network is running okeh financially© I firmly believe it will be self-supporting\nwhen Kellogg funds are exhausted© I cannot say as much for the rest of the projects\nI have never heard anyone discuss what happens to headquarters when Kellogg is done©\nCertainly it is not too early to discuss this and at least form some tentative idea\nof what we might do0\nI believe you will agree that the above problems; are basic© Same need immediate\nsolution so that headquarters at least can function properly in relation to new\nmembers© Some immediate thought must be given to the TV situation© And then, of\ncourse, the long range picture is vital© I believe this calls for another really\ngood, long-term meeting at which we thrash out all of these problems and the many\nothers which are related to them©\nI do not think we should be in any way discouraged by this confusion© To me it is a\nsign of reel growth, and X am constantly aware that other associations far older\nthan we are still going through some of these problems© Some of you may have noticed\nthe other day that as old and wealthy an association as the Radio Manufacturers\nAssociation shifted.gears again© A year and a half ago they embraced the idea of a\npaid president© Two weeks ago they disowned the idea and went back to a non-paid\npresident© And then they added that this was by no means an irrevocable decision —\nmeaning to me that even now there were some \"Doubting Thomases\" in the group©"
