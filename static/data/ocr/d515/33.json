The time spent in Board Meetings\nin briefing, \"up dating\" and explaining organizational relationships\nleads me to believe that I*m not alone in this state of confusion. The\nBoard of Directors, which is presumably \"in the know\", is confused.\nHow much more confusing our present organization must be to the general\nmembership!\nLet me admit now that the proposed NAEB \"Structure\" (Schematic B)\nmay actually be closer to the real structure than that shown in Schema¬\ntic A, as I have based it on the present commitments, committees, and\nthe regional structure. Schematic A is merely my idea of the structure\nof the present organization, ahd its apparent disjointodness may be due\nto my own confusion.\nLet me also say that both Schematics probably contain omissions\nand inaccuracies that came from my own bias.\nThe proposal is merely a suggestion for your consideration to use\nas a basis of departure. I hold no particular brief for it.\nWhatever you do, however, I would like to emphasize a strong per¬\nsonal feeling: We desperately need a clear, structually sound organi-\n2atlon that every member can understand and that will provide: (1) a\nchain of command; (2) a. free unmixed flow of in formation to all members ?\n(3) clear policies; and (4) more democratic procedures to accomplish\nour objectives.\nCOMMITMENTS:\nAny structure that we as an organization assume must take into\nconsideration our:\n1- Needs of members,\n2- Absent Regional §et»Up*"
