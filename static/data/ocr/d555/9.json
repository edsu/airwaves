Certainly the farm problem is of constant concern\nto those of us in the Mid-West. It would seem to me\nthat members could audition the tapes and either play\nthem or not play them at their own discretion. The\ntime limits of the speeches and the odd and varying\nlengths would make it necessary that most of the\nspeeches be broadcast within a very short time anyway.\nI vote \"yes\".\nCongratulations to you Bob and good luck ."
