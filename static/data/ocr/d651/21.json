Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Mr. Harley:\nThis letter is in response to your memorandum of May 25, 1962, con¬\ncerning the production of experimental television programs by NAEB.\nI concur in the stated need for improvement in the quality and quantity\nof television program materials available to educational television sta¬\ntions. However, it is my opinion that the way to provide these services\ndoes not lie in duplication of effort such as you and the NAEB Board are\nsuggesting.\nMy vote must be cast with the two NAEB Television Directors who felt\nthat insufficient direction had been registered to warrant a move by\nNAEB into the production of television programs. On the contrary, it\nis my belief that the overwhelming majority of television station mana¬\ngers feel such action at the present time is not in the best interest of\nthe movement.\nThere is already too much confusion in this country concerning the image\nof educational television. This move can only serve to deepen this con¬\nfusion. The sources of financial support for our programming efforts\nare not inexhaustible. The establishment of a second service in compe¬\ntition with the existing one will, in my opinion, do more harm than good.\nFinally, a wide range of data on financial aspects and production prob¬\nlems is already in hand at NETRC.*1\nThe relationship between NAEB and NETRC is, to be sure, a most\nunfortunate one. There has been talk of duplication of services in\nboth organizations. I am firmly opposed to this type of action in both\norganizations. The primary services of each need to be delineated\nand strengthened. But duplication cannot be allowed to develop.\nRECEIV ED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nJUN 15 1962\nAM PM\n7|8|?|ip(ll|12|l|3|3|4|6|?\nI"
