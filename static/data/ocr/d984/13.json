Anderson\nBox %6\nState Teacher’s College\nWest Chester, Pennsylvaria\nBear Miss Anderson:\nTour card of February 19, addressed to the Chicago Board of Education regarding\ninformation on educational recordings, has been referred to me*\nTt appears that you raif^bt be interested in an active membership in the Association\nfor Education by Radio-Television. Founded sixteen years ago, AERT is a non-profit\norganization, national in scope, which includes among its members teachers and admin¬\nistrators on all-levels of education, commercial broadcasters, religious broadcasters,\ncivic leaders, parents, and representatives of many leading civic groups.\nFrom the information contained on your card, it appears that you would be par¬\nticularly interested in the Journal of the Association for Education by Radio-Tele¬\nvision. This magazine is published monthly during the academic year. It contains\narticles on the utilization and evaluation of both educational radio and educational\ntelevision materials. Specifically, articles in the Journal cover a diverse number\nof topics including areas of communication theory, practical program and promotional\nideas, helpful how-to-do-it and how-to-find-it suggestions, as well as reports on\nlistener council and other evaluation activities.\nYou will be interested to know that the Association for Education by Radio-\nTelevision serves as one of the sponsors of the rational Tape Recording Catalogue\nand Re-recording Service, a project set up in cooperation with the Department of\nAudio and Visual Instruction of the National Education Association.\nI am enclosing a copy of the AERT membership blank which contains a statement\nof the objectives and advantages of membership in the Association.\nI am sure that you would find that a membership in A^KT would provide you with\nboth services and materials which would be of great use yn your work.
