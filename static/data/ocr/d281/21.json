Mott\nSUBJECT: State of the Art papers on Instructional\nRadio and Televl3ion\nI have reviewed the TV document prepared by the R&D\noffice dated September 5, 1968 (as revised) and the\nradio document dated October 1963 by Richard Forsythe.\nThe thought occurs to me that NAEB should have been\ninvolved in both state of the art papers —■ or neither*\nSince NAEB concerns itself with both radio and tele¬\nvision broadcasting, the Commission on Instructional\nTechnology and the association would have benefitted\nby preparing comments on both media.\nAs it is now, NAEB has a position on TV Instruction.\nWhat is the NAEB position on Instructional Radio*\nYou'll recall that the liaison and communication on\nthis matter was confused by personnel changes (Maull in\n— Rhodes out) (Mott in — Sandler out). I am not\nconversant with the decision making that resulted in\nthe association doing a TV study while the radio study\nwas contracted with an individual.\nThe reason for this memo to to suggest that we ought\nnot find ourselves in a similar situation in the future,\nif it can be avoided.\nShouldn't we represent all media in our relationship\nwith the Commission on Instructional Technology — or\nnone?\ncc: Harley\nMarquis\nMaull"
