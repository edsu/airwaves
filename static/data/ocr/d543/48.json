Harley\nPresident, NAEB\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nMadison, Wisconsin\n•\nDear Bill:\nIt was wishful thinking when I told you in my last letter\nthat I would be in California until the end of October.1 I spent\nfour days last week at Stanford attending the Westinghouse Conference\nand two more in San Francisco before jetting it back to the old grind.\nThis was the third effort of Westinghouse to stage a somewhat unique\ncommercial venture in the area of public service programming. I must\nsay that I think they did a pretty good job. My only regret is that\nNAEB members were not included to the degree that they were in the\nfirst one three years ago in Boston.\nI expect to be in town October 7-9 and am sure we can find\na mutually agreeable time to inspect the Eye Street property, pro¬\nvided Mr. Collins has reacted favorably to the idea of our delayed\noccupancy. I would like you to see the space in any case so as to\nbe able better to appraise other vacancies I might discover.\nBest wishes always\nRadio-TV Education Specialist"
