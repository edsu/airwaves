C.\nDear Mr. Harley:\nI apologize for failure to acknowledge receipt of your\nbrochure proposing a plan for development of educational\nbroadcasting as an aid to better citizenship. I\nstudied your plan and think it has real merit.\nAt present. The Richardson Foundation's resources\nare committed to other organizations to an extent\nwhich makes it difficult for us to give favorable\nconsideration to many desirable undertakings.\nI hope that some way may be found to enable you to\ndevelop this idea to fruition.\nCordially yours.\nCapus Waynick\nExecutive Vice President\n1963\nCW:mma"
