Norwood\n2\nFM stations, under Subsidiary Communications Authorizations from the\nFederal Communications Commission, may transmit such specialized programming\nin addition to, and simultaneous with, the transmission of regular programs\nintended for the general audience. Such programs are transmitted on an FM\n\"subcarrier\" and may be heard only on specially equipped receivers. In\nSan Francisco, KXKX (FM) is already engaged in providing such a service.\nThe phrase in Title \"particularly through new and advanced approaches,\"\nmight certainly include the application of this broadcasting technique\nwhich not only provides the possibility of multiple use of a single educational\nradio station, but, because SCA transmission cannot be heard on home receivers,\na means of \"private\" communication which might be applicable to such areas\nas consultative and administrative services.\nThe long history of educational radio's contribution to University\nExtension and Continuing Education, the low cost of using radio to reach\nlarge numbers of people over wide geographic areas, and the technical\ncapabilities of the medium for expanded service, all combine to testify to\nthe role which educational radio can play in achieving the goals which\nH.R. 3220-3221 sets forth. On behalf of the National Educational Radio\nstations of the ten Western states, I commend educational radio to your\nattention, and offer you whatever support we may provide."
