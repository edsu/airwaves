C,\nDear Bill:\nAs last year’s resolutions chairman for DAVI, I concur\nwith your decision to make a drastic change in procedures.\nResolutions are far too important statements to be worked out by\na few people in a short time. Policy statements must be pains¬\ntakingly worked out by our best people without hurry. There\nmay be a place for ’’appreciation\" type resolutions at a conven¬\ntion.\nI have enjoyed my association with NAEB and its\nwonderful professional staff. The NAEB-DAVI fraternization\npleases me very much. Let me know if I may be of service to you.\nRW:as\nSincere! 7,\nVJaymoxLd Wyman\nProfe^or of Education\nAccredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education"
