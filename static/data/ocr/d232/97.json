That particular week is going to be particularly rough. Rudy\nBretz will be with us through January k and then will have to be away\nuntil January 10 in order to meet a prior commitment in Columbus, Ohio;\nthis means that I will have additional duties in regard to the telecast\nproject above and beyond those which I would be assuming anyway. However,\nI think I could take time out to meet with the committee if it met in\nMinneapolis but otherwise I'm afraid I could not tear myself away for\nthat long.\nI'm enclosing a copy of the memorandum which I drew up and which\nwas discussed at yesterday's meeting (December 22) of the Minnesota\nCommittee on Educational Television. This interim committee, representing\n3Â£ state-wide organizations, named a chairman and three vice chairman.\nIt also had to hear the complaints of Stanley Hubbard and Madeline Longl\nWith best wishes for a happy holiday season.\nYours sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nManager\nEnc.\nBP: c jm"
