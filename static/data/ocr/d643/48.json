Skomia\nFROM: Burton Paulu\nI have your letter of April 2l\\. commenting on Ray\nCheydleur1s letter of April 18, relative to setting aside\ntime for HAEB committees to meet, if possible, at association\nexpense. I think this is a good subject to put on the agenda\nfor our board meeting and shall do so.\nWith a number of committees asking for travel and meetÂ¬\ning funds (for example Engineering), we should review this\nmatter a little bit, and firm up or else modify our policy\nas the case may be.\nBP :lt\nCC: Raymond Cheydleur\n^Frank E* Schooley"
