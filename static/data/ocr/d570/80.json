I had several informal\ntalks with the WKAR personnel about their installation and also with the other work¬\nshop participants* I expect to reap greater benefits when we get into actual opera¬\ntion*\n3o In a five-day workshop having such a broad scope and consisting of 2$ participants,\nit is difficult to imagine how much actual operating could be worked in* If the\nscope of the workshop were considerably narrowed and if there were fewer partici¬\npants, then perhaps it could be more of a workshop* I feel that for the time in¬\nvested, the conference pays greater dividencTsT\nSince I was one of the participants who needed the actual operating more than most,\nI am attempting to solve this individually as much as possible by working part-\ntime in a local commercial TV station*\nUp At the workshop X expressed, and heard expressed, the desire on the part of some\nof the participants to receive virtually word-for-word transcripts of some of the\ntalks* I heard various participants indicate that if the NAEB did not have the\ntime, funds, etc* to make the transcripts, that they had the facilities at their\ninstitutions* These transcripts would be valuable, not only to workshop partici¬\npants, but also to other educational TV engineers* Vty greatest personal need is\nfor the papers on lighting* I would be glad to help in having these transcribed\nand duplicated if the NAEB does not plan to do so.\nSo Continue the technical tips, Engineering Newsletter, etc*\nJohn McClamrock\nKUOM—\nThe 19$S NAEB Television Engineering Workshop was a well planned and a well executed\naffair* little can be said in the way of improvement« One thing, however, that did\nseem lacking was the opportunity to see products on display* There are specific pieces"
