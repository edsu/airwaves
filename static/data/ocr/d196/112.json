He said the country was perplexed and troubled by this incapacity\nof the chamber of Deputies.\nDe Geeperi said It was the functionality* the vitality of the Parliament\nthat was at stake and not merely the fortune of one party or the other. He\nappealed to the deputies of the democratic parties to recognise what ha called\nthe necessity for a common, serious and continued effort in order that the\ndecline of Italian democratic Institutions should not become ‘'inevitable and\nfatal.”\nDe Gas peri drew no historic parallel. He didn’t need to. It would be a\nsafe bet that hie words ml every deputy present — including those of the\ntotalitarian left and those of the total!terina ri§ht — to thinking of the\nearly 19^0®. For it was the discrediting of Italy's democratic, parliamentary\ninstitutions in the face of crisis after World War X that paved the way for\nthe triumph of fascism. De Gasper! was actually saying*\nDon’t let it happen again."
