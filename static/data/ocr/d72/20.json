Although I agree with you that it ie rather general in nature\nand doesn't provide any new information for KAEBers, I think we might\nstill use it. Since 1 assume Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph\nwill have to have reprints mods, if they would have printed at the top\nsomething llkei \"Reprinted from Spectrum, house organ of Mountain States\nTelephone and Telegraph, Denver,\" we could use it as anegample of the\ntype of thing that can be used to Inform laymen about ETV. Without such\na taglina, though, 1 don't thtak wo oould use it, because It might ap¬\npear that we were offering it as Informative material.\nIf they want to provide the reprints as indicated, wa will need 2200.\nThanks very much for your interest.\nSincerely#\n(Mrs.) Batty MeRensia\nBMCK/mp"
