Committee\nPROM: Prank Schooley\nRE: Skomia.\n1„ The following telegram was received by me today:\ns?CDU250^33^PD INTL=CD VIENNA VIA RCA 8 1715\nLT MR PRANK SCHOOLEY\nUNIVERSITY OP URBANA (ILL)\nDEFINITELY INTERESTED IN OFFER CONTAINED YOUR WIRE OP\nSEPTEMBER 12th RECEIVED ONLY TODAY IF PERMANENT STOP\nAPPRECIATE FURTHER INFO STOP AVAILABLE MAY STOP\nH J SKORNIA\"\n20 By way of explanation, the embassy in Vienna didn t deliver\nthe wire to Skomia for some reason. Some flunky\nthought it was a broadside looking for help- It found\nway back to Urbana, in hands of a State department\nrepresentative, who called me to see why IJ& sent that\ncable to Austria. I told him in no uncertain terms\nwhat I thought about failure to deliver. He sent fast\nword back to Vienna-\nIf I may suggest, I believe this now calls for some\nletter of explanation by the chairman, Graydon Ausmuso\nI merely suggest this so that matter isn’t left undone-\nIf I am to act further regarding Skomia, Ausmus please\nadvise.\n3o"
