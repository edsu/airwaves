Sohooley\nRes Possible merger of AERT-NAEB\nLetter be lot/ went to Leo Martin today\nDear Leo s\nLet3 a explore the possibilities of raerging/oonsolldatlng/\nabsorbing —■ I use *em all Just to be sure no bad con¬\nnotations are placed upon consideration by anyone— of\nNAEB-AERT groups. Do you have any ideas on hot/ it could\nbe done, under t/hat conditions, etc.? I9m quite t/illing\nto study the problem to see t/hat can be worked out, but\nmaybe we ought to consider it personally first, then pro¬\nceed with such steps as we agree upon, I &on3t want\nanyone to think that I5m trying to force through some¬\nthing that lsn8t desirable, and I8m sure you don31 either,\nbut I do think that much might be gained for educational\nbroadcasting interests, ^\nGood to see you last weekend. Sorry I didn3t have more\ntime to spend with you and others cn the committee.\nBest regards,\nSincerely,\nFrank E, Sohooley\nI have good reasons to believe we can work something out, It will\nbe delicate if we can* Maybe all of us can gain something. It\nwould make one less horse in the rase. Your reactions, pro and\nson, will help, but please let*a be careful with this one. You\nmight call this a trial balloon, but if it goes, maybe? to credit\nof all.\nocs Skornia\nCohn and Marks"
