Or\na view of political ideologies, includ¬\ning a statement by Herbert Ap-\nthecker. Or a program on the use of\nnarcotics at college campuses, includ¬\ning a statement bv a leader of\nLFMar.\nIt is almost a foregone conclusion\nthat any such program would be fol¬\nlowed immediately by outraged\nspeeches from senators and congress¬\nmen and private taxpayers about the\nmisuse of taxpayers’ money. And\nthe chances are pretty good that the\nprogrammers would be hauled up\nbefore one or more congressional\ncommittee and harassed for present¬\ning that type of program.\nNo matter how strong the safe¬\nguards, they wouldn’t stop dema¬\ngogues from trying to make political\nhay from controversial programming,\nparticularly when public funds were\ninvolved. The end result could very\nwell be that noncommercial television\nwould wind up showing nothing more\npenetrating than its own equivalent\nof “Beverly Hillbillies.”\nWe are inclined to go along with\nFred W. Friendly, former head of the\nCBS News Division, who said he\nwould be opposed to any system that\nrelied on general Treasury Depart¬\nment appropriations which would be\nsubject to annual reviews by Con¬\ngress. He suggested instead that\nnews and public affairs programming\nbe underwritten from private funds,\npreferably out of the savings that\nmight be realized by a nonprofit sys¬\ntem of communications satellites.\nWe can only repeat what we said\nlast February in connection with the\ncreation of a state-operated television\nnetwork: “The inherent dangers are\nobvious to anyone who gives it serious\nconsideration. And the fact that the\nincursions are labeled ‘educational’\nand that present intentions are com¬\npletely honorable does not in any\nway lessen the potential danger.”"
