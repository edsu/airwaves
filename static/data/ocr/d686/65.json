However, I certainly think\nthat fish ought to be available sinoe it is Friday.\nWe are doing everything possible to get enough money to handle\nthe NAEB Board meeting. At the moment, we just don’t have the funds.\nFurthermore, most people come to the IER meeting on their own budgets.\nObviously, if funds are available by May 1 ( and I am doing everything\nI can to see that they are), the Board will authorize reimbursement\nfor travel.\nInsofar as your Oram and ^ich comments are concerned, the general\nunderstanding is that NAEB will receive at least $2000 clear on any\n$1000 that is paid to Oram and &ich. Oram, of course, is much more\noptomistic, and feels that we will raise far more than the $25,000\n(in the clear) during any one year.\n'Hiere has not been any difficulty in the past two campaigns in\nobtaining funds from Foundations, even though we were represented by\nOram and ^ich. Ihe technique is such that they do not even enter the\npicture when it comes to direct negotiations. All of the work has\nthen to be done by yours truly.\nYou have, of course, heard the good news about Dick Hull. He\nwill be going to Washington as the paid chairman of JCET. Bob Hudson\nhas taken leave from Illinois and now is the paid consultant to the\nFord Foundation. All of this is as it should be, but I feel that\nour best operating personnel is going to be stripped down.\nI will be in touch with you as socaa as I have time to write in\ndetail. ft\nWith all best wishes, I am\nSNSsas\nSeynu\nPre 3\ntourN. Si©gel\nident, NAEB\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
