April 11, 1955\ni\nJack Westbrook\nHugh Mix\nJohn Holt^\nGentlemen:\nLike the rest of the members of the Com\nsnowed recently and it was only during the\nI v/as able to give serious attention to sevafr\npending before the Committee. In theMfcniSree\ninformation, here are my votes.\nLttee, I have been\n;ter holidays that\n^1 of the shows\n.of speed, if not\nM ON motZi Xes\noriginal thirteen. I\nLue can continue the\nexcellent series. Yes.\nnGRALc AND POLITICS: nev*fr/been disappointed in\na Cooper*s Union series yet*/Although hour lectures\nsometimes tend to bog, I*ll,v^te Yes.\nROOTS OF JAZZ: /tafcugh t 1 on£\\Mme about this one.\nFinally decided .to vote Yg^. however, I do not care\nat all for the prolonged aijialysis of slavery and\nits effect on Jazz. Would; like to see those three\nprograms either deleted ,or rewritten. Instead of\na few brief comments a| to the effect of slavery on\nJazz, /we have a belated and unnecessary indictment\nof slavery.\nTHE ADVENTURES hi TOM SAWYER:\nme. The actorshhre obviously\nUL This series disturbed\n. „ , ly not boys. Furthermore,\nthe dialogue is a little bit too much of Twain. The\nidiom is neither accurate nor entertaining. Situations\nare poorly developed and consist mostly of quantities\nof dull talk, I vote No.\nAMERICAN ADVENTURE: here I thought the writing far\nsuperior to the acting. The \"Free Man” struck me\nas an excellent script, but suffered because of\nweak acting. Only the lead was convincing. ”Story\nof A Poet,'* was of a higher caliber and on the basis\nof this and the good writing, 1*11 vote Yes.\nSincerely,\nJS/eg\nJim Slack\nNAEB Acceptance Subcommittee"
