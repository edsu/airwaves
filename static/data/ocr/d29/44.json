We have now no\nchoice but to understand and to control the new technology,\nsince its power is too sudden and total to be absorbed by\ncasual osmotic or subliminal means.\nFor the first time in human history, progress is on\npurpose. Inspiration has supplanted perspiration. Education\nmust, therefore, assume the same power of prediction and\ncontrol of over-all situations and change. To eliminate the\nsubliminal levels from all media, new and old, is a minimal\nstep in educational strategy under such conditions.\nTo achieve this end, to-day, is not as difficult as it\nwould have been a few years ago, precisely because the multi-\nmedia world is luminous from within. The x-ray action of one\nmedium upon another reveals the structure of the boms and\norgans of society. We have long know the structure of external\nmachinery. But we have known little about the organic\nstructure of society. Yet the organs of society are, quite\nnaturally, networks of human association. And just as the\ndynamic structure of our vernacular tongues was hidden until\nthe tape-recorder gave us ready access to them, so the\nstructure and operation of the languages, as it were, of the\nmedia of writing and gesture and print and photography, reÂ¬\nmained concealed beneath the vesture of social accidents and\novert uses."
