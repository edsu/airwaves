Actually the NAEB recognizes it made a mistake by not working more\nclosely with labor. The people setting up commercial stations must correlate with\nlabor on personnel problems. As we grow, so will labor, and as we grow we will both\naccept the responsibility towards cooperation.\nSkornia: St. Louis had a labor problem so had need of a labor consultant to\ncreate understanding. Novik was able to assist them. When they are approached\nright, the unions will generally give their support for apprentice courses. Where\nelse can such training come from? Of course, some places are entirely professional\nand have no use for student training.\nNovik: It took WNYC four to six years to get all labor with craft interests\nto realize the difference between this station and commercial ones. Now labor\nholds the general attitude that non-commercial ETV is different from educational\nradio, and we have the job to do over again.\nSkornia: There is no standard reaction on labor by educators so why is there\na standard reaction on the part of labor?\nWheatley: Programs are what make for good relations.\nSkornia: The Lowell Cooperative Broadcasting Council is definitely an educa¬\ntional station and so recognized—so it’s less of a problem than a community station.\nNovik: What are you doing on the community level to get promotion and interest?"
