Such a joint workshop could\nbe conducted in two sections. Each section could be made up of an equal number of en^\ngineers and producers thus not increasing the length of the workshop or overburdening\nthe physical facilities*\nFeeling that one of the most important products of the workshop is the exchange of ideas,\nexperiences and problems, X greatly appreciated the talks by Chenoweth, Remley, Mac¬\nIntyre, etc. This idea, of presenting speakers from member organizations, I would like\nto see retained, and, if possible, expanded in future workshops, in view of the shor¬\ntened, compact schedule, with which, by the way, I am in accord, allowing lees time\nfor general bull sessions. These speakers could replace the obvious sales pitches\nwhich at present are unavoidable but, as time goes by, can be avoided*\nX feel that actual operation of equipment is impractical and time consuming for such\na large group. However, well-planned demonstrations, conducted by regular operating\npersonnel, are of great benefit*\nNot knowing just how much time the NAE3 Engineering Service can extend the member organi¬\nzations, it would be difficult to say how much help may be rendered. However, the\nEngineering Service, because of its unique position, can be of considerable value in\nthe area of channeling information and ideas: while the Engineering Service may not\nbe able to solve all members9 problems and difficulties, it certainly is in a better po\nsition to direct these difficulties to someone who can help, or has undergone these same\ndifficulties*\nThis year9s well-conducted Engineering Workshop has been a very valuable, as well as,\npleasant experience, and I sincerely hope that it will be continued*\nWOSU-FM—\n**********\nA* J. Boggioni\nIn regard to your questionnaire, following are my answers:\n1* No* X thought this yearns Workshop went very well and was very happy with it*\n2c Yeso I received exactly what was expected*\n3* No* I think the theory and lectures would have been much better had there been\ngroups of 25 or more people*"
