L\nRADIO STATION KUSD\nUNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA\nVERMILLION\n690 KILOCYCLES\nlOOO WATTS\nFebruary 21, 1956\nNAEB headquarters\nFlB 2 o It>63\nTo ; John Holt, Waldo Abbot,\nJohn Regnell, Hugh Mix\nFROM: Jim -.lack\nSUBJECT ; Books and around\nSound Track\ni\nBooks and Around Does anybody really know how to talk\nto children? I am not sure these talented Michigan\nyoungsters have the slightest idea whether or not they\nare communicating. There is, in this program, the same\nelaborate over emphasis done, I presume in the name of\nclarity and simplicity. Is it always necessary to discuss\nanimals, birds and people in tones of awe — is breath¬\nlessness essential to understanding in the child’s mind.\nCaptain Kangaroo just talks to the children and, in my\nopinion, his acceptance of them as people, albeit special\nlittle people, is a far more effective way of reaching them\nthan the method chosen by ’’Books and Around”. My principle\nobjection is that I feel the show does not communicate fully\n..'.I do not necessarily advocate that all children's shows\npattern themselves after the good Captain. No.\nSound Track: Disappointed in this one. The idea is a very\ngood one but it does not come off for me. The commentator\nspeaks in a very learned manner but I have the feeling that\nhe is parroting gibberish compounded of snotty reviews from\nthe ’’New Yorker” and the defiant but inaccurate memoirs of\nErich Von Stroheim. He goes to a great deal of trouble to\nestablish points of little consequence — i.e. the similarity\nbetween the voice of Dietrich and Harris. The whole thing\nwas patchy and condescending. No."
