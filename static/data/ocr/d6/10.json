  "text": "- 6\nnon-profit or non-commercial educational broadcast\nstations does not fall into the category of the alleged\nvices. My purpose in appearing here today is to request\nthat the bill be amended so as to specifically exclude\nnon-profit tax exempt educational institutions. This\ncould be accomplished if another section were added to\nthe proposed bill as follows:\n\"The provisions of this paragraph\nshall not apply to any construction\npermits or licenses for a broad¬\ncasting station which shall be\ngranted to or held by a non-profit\nor non-commercial tax exempt educa¬\ntional university, college, or insti¬\ntution. \"\nAddition of this language would exclude these educational\ninstitutions whom I believe it is not the intention of the\nbill to cover"
