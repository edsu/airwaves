This because the purpose of the present\ntest period was to reduce interference and such interference could be as objectionable\nfrom educational FM stations as from any others. The matter was referred to\nMr, Braum who contacted the FCC and reported as follows: The FCC will accept\nrequests for special temporary authority to conduct tests of FM transmitters\nduring the daytime hours, and whenever possible such permission will be granted.\nIt was also indicated that authority to conduct these daytime tests might be\ngranted for rather extended periods, but it is advised that the actual time of\nsuch test be limited to possibly 15 minutes before the regular broadcast day and\nthat no more than two sustained frequencies be used during any single test period.\nF. Proposed FCC regulations re harmonic and spurious radiation. This matter\nwas discussed at length and Mr. Braum reported that there was presently\nconsiderable question as to the exact proposed requirements and methods."
