POWELL\nJanuary 11, i960\nPHONE\nPUBLICATIONS DIRECTOR\nMiss Betty McKenzie\nPublications Editor\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Miss McKenzie:\nWe advised our printer that you could use an inked copy of\nthe drawing which illustrated \"NAEB Radio\" and is being\ncarried in our forthcoming Annual Report. The printer adÂ¬\nvised that they merely took the pencil drawing which you\nfurnished, cleaned it up and retouched it directly on their\nnegative. The printer has sent to us, and we are relaying to\nyou, gloss prints of the separated colors and these prints,\naccording to the printer, should be exactly what you need\nfor any future reproductions.\nThank you, indeed, for your cooperation. We hope that you\nlike the NAE3B presentation as carried in our Annual Report\nwhich you should receive shortly after January 20.\nHBP: dc\nenc."
