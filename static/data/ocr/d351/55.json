  "text": "October 35, 1959\nMr. William Bender, Jr.\n13U5> Medical Center\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Bills\nYou have, no doubt, received by now a copy of Dr. Skoraia's letter to ms\nunder date of October 13 dealing with suggested agenda for the Public\nHalations Committee• Knowing the Committee as we do, if you can develop\nany consensus of action on these seven items within the allotted hour of\nyour meeting, you are indeed a genius. We will agree, I know, that all of\nDr. Skoraia's suggestions have much merit.\n1 have already discussed with you the need of approving a simple logo¬\ntype design and I believe that you had best concentrate on that.\nX have a question regarding Dr. Skoraia's item number two, namely the audio\nstation break. Would this be confined to just those WAgp members sub¬\nscribing to the tape network or would it be something that could be used\nby all of us? Obviously, I favor the latter interpretation. Point three\nmight be taken cars of by circulating among the membership a list of re¬\nspective periodicals accospanied by brief statements of their respective\ncontent policies. If the Committee thinks that this is a good idea, any\none of us could do this.\nI believe that as far as four is concerned headquarters has already been\ndesignated as a repository for exhibit materials. Check me on this and if\nI am right, should we intensify our efforts among the membership to make\nuse of this facility?\nI have seen no local results of the intensified program of NABB press re¬\nleases. Perhaps other members of the Committee can comment on this. Item\nsix is, in my opinion, a matter that should be basically taken care of by\nencouraging the respective broadcasting directors to work with their own\ncollege news bureaus. Tou now have my valuable comments.\nBest of luck at the meeting.\nCordially yours.\nSlner G. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nEQSisd\ncc: Dr. Harry J. Skornia^"
