Frankly* we just don9t have the $250*\neven though the program offerings are worth far more than\nthat. You may recall that we were able to belong to the\nnetwork only six months last year. Even that is not possible\nthis year.\nYou are doing a great service for those whose\nbudgets will meet the reasonable assessments made. I hope\nwe can be a part of the network again in the future.\nSincerely*\n/s/ Lucile Ruby\nLuciie Ruby\nActing Director* WLSU\nLR/crf\nCopy made 9/15/53"
