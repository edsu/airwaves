Mr. President, the an¬\nnouncement In New York yesterday that\nJohn W. Macy, Jr., had been appointed\nas president of the Corporation for Pub¬\nlic Broadcasting was certainly welcomed\nby supporters of noncommercial broad¬\ncasting.\nThose of us in Congress who worked\nwith Mr. Macy when he was Chairman\nof the Civil Service Commission—and\nthat means almost every Member of\nCongress—regard him as an eminently\nfair, public servant, as well as a most\neffective administrator. His appointment,\nin my judgment, indicates that the board\nof directors of the corporation are\nbuilding on firm ground in the effort to\nmake the promise of the Public Broad¬\ncasting Act of 1967 a reality.\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con¬\nsent to have printed in the Record the\nannouncement made yesterday by the\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting con¬\ncerning Mr. Macy’s new role, and an ar¬\nticle published in this morning’s New\nYork Times on the same subject.\nThere being no objection, the anounce-\nment and article were ordered to be\nprinted in the Record, as follows:\nNew York, February 6.—John W. Macy,\nJr., Chairman of the U.S. Civil Service Com¬\nmission under Presidents Kennedy and John¬\nson, and a former Executive Vice President\nof Wesleyan University, Middletown, Con¬\nnecticut, has been elected President of the\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, it was\nannounced today by Frank Pace, Jr„ Chair¬\nman of the Board.\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting\nis a nonprofit agency, Federally-chartered\nunder the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967\nto coordinate and fund public broadcasting\nin the United States.\n“The Corporation is fortunate indeed to\nhave a man of Mr. Macy’s quality and ability\nas its President and Chief Executive Officer,”\nMr. Pace' stated. “The Board Committee,\nheaded by Mr. John D. Rockefller 3rd and\nwith Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby and Dr. Milton\nS. Eisenhower as members, unanimously rec¬\nommended John Macy after a most careful\nsearch for the best man available for this\nimportant post. They felt, and the Board\nagreed, that he will provide the leadership\nnecessary to realize the exciting potential of\npublic broadcasting. Furthermore, his inti¬\nmate knowledge of government, his broad ac¬\nceptance in the academic community, and\nhis ability to work with people make him\nuniquely qualified for this assignment. This\nis a man of broad scope whose growth poten¬\ntial is still not fully realized.”\nIn addition to the statutory Job as head of\nthe U.S. Civil Service Commission, Mr. Macy\nacted for President Johnson as the principal\nrecruiter for positions at the highest levels\nof government.

Macy, the new president of the\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, declared\nyesterday that the primary purpose of public\ntelevision should be \"broadly educational”\nand that local noncommercial stations should\nbe strengthened and not dominated by a na¬\ntional network.\nMr. Macy, who was formally appointed yes¬\nterday by the corporation’s board of direc¬\ntors is the immediate past chairman of the\nCivil Service Commission and was chief talent\nscout for Federal Jobs for the Johnson Ad¬\nministration. He has no broadcasting exper¬\nience. From 1958 to 1961 he served as execu¬\ntive vice president of Wesleyan University in\nMiddletown, Conn.\nMr. Macy inherits a six-man executive staff\nchosen last November by the corporation’s\n15-man board. He said in an interview after\nhis announcement that he was “impressed\nwith all of them.” He plans to appoint two\nnew officers of the Congressionally founded\nCorporation, one with broadcasting exper¬\nience, t’ne other with financial credentials.\nMr. \\Jacy said he would be based in Wash¬\nington and. deal with Congress and the Ex¬\necutive branc* of the Government to obtain\npermanent financing for the corporation. In\nApril he will go before the House Appropria¬\ntions Committee to request $20-million for\nthe fiscal year 1970. Federal /unds to the cor¬\nporation so far have total $5-miJHon.\nThe rest of the corporation staff v.^U be di¬\nvided between two central offices in Wash¬\nington and New York, but it is expected tha t\nthere will be frequent commuting between\nthe two cities by Mr. Macy and the other\nofficers.\nMr. Macy indicated that it was essential\nthat Government funding (“and there is no\nway out of that,” said the corporation chair¬\nman, Frank Pace) not impair “freedom from\nFederal interference.”\nMr. Macy also said that the corporation\nwould not decide what programs would ap¬\npear on the noncommercial network of ap¬\nproximately 140 edpcational stations.\n“It is important that we not become a\njudge of individual programing,” he con¬\ntinued, and “we will never tell a local station\nwhat is best for its community.” He also\nsaid, and Mr. Pace agreed, that smaller sta¬\ntions would not suffer at the hands of the\neight largest (who originate most of the\neducational network programing) when the\ncorporation gives out individual grants.\nIn a broadcast taped yesterday afternoon\nfor use on National Educational Television\nlast night, the new corporation president\nsaid that noncommercial television was “hot\ncompeting with commercial TV; we’re aug¬\nmenting it, supplementing it and we haven’t\nfound the full potential of this medium in\nsocial and cultural involvement.”\nHe called noncommercial TV a \"nation¬\nwide community effort” and said that the\ncorporation could aid that effort by “doing\nsomething about funding, assisting in the de¬\nvelopment and procuring of physical facil¬\nities, color equipment and furthering the\ncentral resources of N.E.T.”\nAsked what he thought of television in\ngeneral, Mr. Macy, who stands 6 foot-one,\nhas prematurely white hair and wears glasses\nwith colorless rims, compared himself to an¬\nother former Johnson aide, Jack Valenti,\npresident of the Motion Picture Association\nof America:\n“Jack said when he took the Job that he\nhad never seen a bad movie in his life; I\ncan’t say that.”"
