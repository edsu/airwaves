Siebert\nDirector, School of Journalism and Communications\nUniversity of Illinois\nDear Prof. Siebert:\nAt this time I should like to request the assignment of\nat least one, and preferably two, graduate assistants for\nthe coming year.\nAs you know the main office of the NAEB is in the process\nof being set up. As part of that program, and for the network\nas well, there is a small item in the budget for promotion\nand publicity. It is such a small item that if we hired a\nperson to do the job there wouldnâ€™t be any funds for printing,\ncuts, matts, etc. So, it would seem that graduate students\nin Journalism and Communications would be most useful in this\ncapacity.\nPerc Tannenbaum would be ideally suited for such a job,\nand if convenient to your plans and budget I would be deeply\nappreciative if he could be assigned to us. Anyone of the\nremaining assistants would probably serve as the second\none.\nI am hopeful that such a plan can be fitted into your\nbudget and the requirements of the rest of the school. At\nany rate, we would appreciate any consideration you can\ngive to this request.\nMany thanks.\nRichard L. Rider\nManager\nC A"
