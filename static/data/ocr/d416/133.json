The bones form the\nskeleton, or framework, of the body. Each is shaped to do its own work, as the\nskull, ribs, and leg bones. The muscles act with the bones. They pull and let\ngo, moving different parts of the body. For example, one set of muscles pulls\nthe leg bones forwardanother set pulls them back. Bone meets bone at the joints.\nSome joints do not move, such as the joints of the skull. Other parts, like arms,\nlegs, and backbones, have movable joints, either hinge or ball-and-socket type.\nLigaments and tendons tie the bones together and tie the ends of muscles to the\nbones.\nThings to Do;\n1. Look at bone and muscle cells under a microscope.\n2. Study a model or pictures of a skeleton â€” note different kinds of joints.\n3. Examine tendons in wrist and heel. What do they do?\nSources:\n.1, Rogers et al. - Man and the Biological World\n2., Carroll - Understanding our World\nProgram No. 17\nVOICE\nThings to Remember:\n1. Sound is one form of communication,\n2. Our voices are sounds.\n3. We use our voices to communicate with others.\nSound is a very common means of communication, and probably the most important\nsound-producing mechanism is that connected with the human voice. Without speech\nour lives would be very different. We produce sounds when air from the lungs is\nblown through a narrow slit between two bands of tissue in the throat. These\nbands, the vocal cords, are set in vibration. This vibration caused the air\n-13-"
