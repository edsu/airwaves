Me*re ready to explore some of the practical promises\nof the sea. As a result, the ocean is a very busy place.\nShe indicates the bathyscaphe (OR saucer) which is included in the set...\nand says it is taking visiting scientists and other guests on tours of exploration\nand observation.\nThe teacher leaves her tractor and moves to the foreground, as the camera\npulls back, to reveal in the right foreground the superstructure of an ocean\nfloor drilling rig...with TV lights and camera...and lines extending to the ship\nfloating above. The teacher says that to get at the ocean's enormous oil\nreserves, a daring new technique has been worked out in which the entire\noperation is performed from an anchored ship. All the drilling equipment is\nlowered to the sea bed, where it digs itself in by remote control. Through\nunderwater TV cameras, the operators can watch what is happening, and the\ndrilling can be carried out exactly as on land, despite the fact that the well¬\nsite may be a thousand feet down.. .much too deep for divers to reach. Vlhat\ndo you suppose were some of the problems they encountered here? How do you\nsuppose they were solved?\nThe teacher says that scientists are putting their imaginations to work\non the problem of mining the immense qualities of rare metals in the ocean."
