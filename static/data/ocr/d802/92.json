As such, it would be fine in a\nseries of programs, possibly, but alone - like ham mit\nno eggs.\nTHE INTELLECTUAL ADVENTURE OF ANCIENT MAN - U* of Chicago\n— YES - This is a very interesting short series of talks\non a subject that the great majority of people would have\nlittle opportunity to know anything about.thus, they\nwould be enlightened, and not in a boring, academic fashion.\nAlthough one of the programs is 18:00, John Holt has as¬\nsured me that he feels it can be cut to less than 15:00,\nand then we*d have a series of three. Of course, a sta¬\ntion could lump them all together, cutting out opens and\ncloses, and make a single 45 minute talk — this is what\nI*d probably do if I were a program director.\nSOME AMERICAN WORTHIES - U. of Chicago\n—YES - I enjoyed these and think that it*s worthwhile\nto present the rather unusual little stories of four men**\nlives. The lengths are bad, but John tells me that he\ncan probably do some editing without too much trouble,\nsince they are so close to the right length.\nREFLECTIONS OF GEORGE ORWELL - U. of Chicago\n— NO - Although the subject matter is fairly interest¬\ning, I felt that the presentation was rather dull - as\na matter of fact, I practically dozed off while audition¬\ning the tape. Also, the lengths are so different as to\nbe incapable of adjustment."
