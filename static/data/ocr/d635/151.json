Gai£ Adkins and John Crabbe have both\nindicated to me that they would accept the job. However, both\nare slated for Voice of America assignments in the very near\nfuture, I understand, and any decision concerning them vrculd have\nto be made immediately. Frankly, my first vote beyond Skornia\nis for Greenlee.\nBecause of many important matters that are hanging fire\nat the moment and need attention, I should like to call a meeting\nof the Executive Committee for as early in January as possible.\nPerhaps, the 8th or 9th would be a good date* At this point\nthose days are clear for me and it is possible that we could get\nBurton to join you, Jim and me there. Give me a response as soon\nas possible •\nMy kindest personal regards*\nSincerely yours.\nGAtpse\ncc s Richard Hull\nBurton Paulu"
