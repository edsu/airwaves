  "text": "(b) to draw the attention of member organisations to the United Nations\nconference on \"The Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\" to\nbe held in Vienna, August 14-27, 1968, and to the importance of the\nbroadcasters* point of view being properly presented at this conference.\n(c) recommend to member organisations that, in view of the importance to\nbroadcasting of such developments in satellite technology as distribuÂ¬\ntion and broadcast salellite systems, they support and press for\nmeasures to ensure early action by the ITU in this field and for views\nof the broadcasters to be taken into account in this respect;\nthat, specifically, they take appropriate steps to impress upon the\nnational authorities the importance of the ITU convening at the\nearliest possible moment an extra ordinary administrative radio\nconference concerning space communication to follow up the work of\nthe 1963 conference, and\nthat, to achieve this end, the national authorities be requested to\nrecommend to the ITU that measures be taken for the next plenary\nsession of the CCIR to be held soonest.\nBy way of explanation I should say that all of us recognised the importance of\ndistribution satellites - the next step in the science of space communication.\nHowever, whatever technological advances are made, nothing can be achieved until\nITU - the only body with the power to do so - can deal with the difficult problem\nof frequency allocation and orbital parking. Rules on these matters must be\ndrawn up in advance of any use of distribution satellites. However, an\nextraordinary radio conference will be essential to decide these matters but\nsuch a conference cannot be held until the next Plenary Session of the CCIR is\ncompleted. Section (c) of the above resolution is designed to speed up the\nprocedures which must be dealt with before the conference.\nW.S. HAMILTON\nAssistant General Manager\nAustralian Broadcasting Commission\n9th May, 1968"
