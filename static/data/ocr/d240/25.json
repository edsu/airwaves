They are\nthree out of a multitude of such special laws, rules and regulations which govern\nour conduct.\nAll people have rules. Some of them are mere matters of etiquette, like us¬\ning the right fork for salad. Some are special customs, as when the groom gives\nhis bride a ring. Some are tabus, such as the rule against using certain words in\npublic, or against eating certain foods.\nMany are Laws\nMany are laws, established regulations of conduct which are supported by\ngovernment and by penalties against those who break the rules. Some are deep re¬\nligious convictions, such as our rules of monogamy. In addition, in America we\nhave a host of special regulations passed by legislature, city councils, school\nboards.\nEvery society has rules which govern the behavior of its members—for with¬\nout rules there would be chaos -- in al 1 societies we may find the counterpart of\netiquette, of custom, of tabu, of religious regulations and of law. But of course\nthe customs, tabus and laws vary from one people to another.\nBehind the rules and regulations lie certain general principles. These prin¬\nciples serve as broad guides in the formulation of regulations. These guides we\ncall ethics. Ethics are not the rules themselves, but the principles by which\nwe judge whether the rule is right and proper. Every culture has a set of princi¬\nples; all people have ethics.\nExperimental Discussion Program Subject to Revision\n29"
