  "text": "Luncheon Address by Dr. Burton Paulu\nNAEB Fulbright Fellow In\nGreat Britain, 1953-5U\nWhy should a group of American educational broadcasters be in¬\nterested in how broadcasting is done in the United Kingdom? I can think\nof several reasons.\nSince you are intelligent people, you naturally have an interest in\nsuch an important subject as broadcasting in one of the other great democ¬\nracies of the world. Because you are broadcasters, you of course are\nanxious to learn about the way your work is done in other countries. And\nfinally, as members of NAEB you are interested in the BBC since many of\nthe programs your stations get from the NAEB tape network originate over\nthere.\nAs Dick Hull has told you, I went to Britain as a Fulbright scholar.\nOn the same basis Larry Creshkoff went to France and Graham Hovey to Italy.\nFor three very enjoyable weeks in February and March, the three of us con¬\nferred and worked together in Rome and Paris; in addition, Larry and I\nhad a week in Brussels as well. In Rome Hovey played host to Mr. and Mrs.\nCreshkoff and my wife and me. We saw some of the glories of ancient Rome,\nwent to the opera, heard Rome Radio’s excellent symphony orchestra, met\nand talked to a number of key officials from the Italian broadcasting\norganization, and learned a good deal about radio and television broad¬\ncasting in Italy today. Clearly Hovey is doing a good job providing liaison\nbetween American educational broadcasters and Italian radio, as well as\nreporting to NAEB listeners about the Italian scene.\n- 12 -"
