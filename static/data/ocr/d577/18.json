They are the only authoritative bench-mark studies known, of\nthe introduction of a new medium into a culture and social system, in the\nfirst nation to use television on a mass scale. In this capacity they have\nenjoyed world-wide circulation and influence.\nThe results of the first of these studies, even prior to final publica¬\ntion, constituted a significant part of the testimony presented before the FCC.\non the basis of which that body reserved specific television channels for edu~\ncation — the basic structure of commercial television appearing to be unable,\nregardless of good will or the adjustments it might make, to provide the facil¬\nities, time, structure, professional staffs and climate essential to maximum\neducational utilization of electronic communications media."
