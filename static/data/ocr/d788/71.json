Attention was called to the fact that at the Okla¬\nhoma Convention last year George had said that a five hundred page pub*\nlished report was in the works, and would soon be off the presses. In\nour efforts to find out what was the status of this report, George said\nthat ISO pages were written but that it was nest finished.\nAfter some conversation it was requested that George put a con¬\nclusion on this unfinished report and send it to Skomia so that, as\na last resort MABB Headquarters could pull together out of it the final\nreport which the FAE well deserves.
