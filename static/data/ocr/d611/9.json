But it is also a hymn of life and hope for better things\nto come. The series is about as hard hitting as most soap operas\nare insipid. Portia never had to face this kind of life.\nâ€”*.xa> ArTAAUZn\nThis sort of drama does not occur over\novernight. It takes months\nof hard work, particularly in rounding up the actors and writers.\nTo live up to the high standards of realism demanded by the format,\nKCET established an emergency Actors Workshop, hired three pro-\niXc\nfessional actors well acquainted with both acting and barrio^to\nguide the group, and plugged into the Mexican-American grapevine.\nQuickly word got out and the workshop membership grew to 65. From\nthis momentum KCET has acquired the services of many fine actors\nand the community has a new theatrical company.\nAnother crash project was the selection of writers for the\nseries. As with the actors, KCET circulated word through the\ncommunity, as well as the Writers Guild. Twenty-five writers were\ninterviewed, nine were asked to submit scripts, and four were\nselected; all on the basis that they could portray the reality of\nthe barrio on television."
