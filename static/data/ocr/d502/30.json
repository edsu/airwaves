Told him how to handle the problem. And lucky for our side 2 am meeting both\nHeller (AFTRA) and VSalsh ’TA) in Kiani.\n2t will help to know that Pittsburgh is IA Town> no IBEW in her©—so it will be\neasier. Had a very fine session with Saner—And Day (S.F.), Sener is by far ahead in\nhis contacts—layed out his whole approach when he meets with them week of Feb. 1. Ho\nhas friendly relations with IA-NABET-IBEV* Hie problem w511 be when he has to formalize\nhis procedure—when he adds staff—and goes on for longer time*\nHe is completely satisfied that my formulates explained to you* if 1 get it accepted,\nwill help him Immediately to solve his future needs.\nDay, has a good relationship with EAHET-IHEW—Both want to keep 1A—out— (strong©\nas that may seem). He agrees to formula—and it would solve his present and future needs.\nI am getting staff breakdown for him.\nHouston was a real treat, inspit© of all the worry9. I got to watch my step. Texans\nare sensitive etc., etc*, and he isnH on© of us etc0, etc. That s nonsense—he is—\nalert and willing to take suggestions. And frankly after first half hour be said, nHe will\nbe asking me for help—Rather then ^3,80 versa*1*\nHis is not an employment problem. There are no Unions in Town except Musicians—And\nI think 2 can help. Will talk to Petrillo next week. I urged that he stick closer to\nKAEB. He did attend Oklahoma Meeting, Maybe you saw him in Y., He said he was at\nSaseej-i O^isMsa^\nHe is outspoken in hie school. Democratic tendencies and respected by School\nAdministration for it. Between us, I will try to help him with Mayor, Roy Hofheinz, an^\nold Ass. Pres — Hope this will give you some idea of present set up.\nHarry, this in confidence. John Schwarzwalder wants help from Ford-from Centre Set\nUp. H© needs some equipment. It*s amazing what h© does with his little budget. I only\nsaw it on surface, I confess. He got the green light yesterday for a very good Negro\nProgram-©. tie-up with Negro University. He says every one is scared about his sponsor**-\nBut that he has not had any suggestion of what to do—or what not to do from that source.\nHe will be keeping in close touch with you*\nAs Ever,\n/s/ Bovik\ncopy made 1/28/54"
