He is very much interested in the Title\njob. I take it that he would not be unhappy to leave\nand that he finds the money attractive. I do\nnot know whether it is too late for you to do anything\nabout this - or whether you want to - but am passing on\nthe information.\nJust talked to Harwood too. He would vote for Westley,\nKumata, Merrill â€” in that order. He is definitely not\ninterested.\nIt was good talking to you.\nBest,\nSLB:mw\nSamuel L. Becker\nChairman, NAEB\nResearch Committee"
