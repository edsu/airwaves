To make up for the difference in time, a\nhalf-hour eight-episode serial, THE BRIBE OF LAMMERMOOR, -will be available in the\nsame issues with the last eight BBC THEATRE programs,\nTHE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR will be followed by serial adaptations of two other\nhistorical adventure novels, Charles Kingsley*s V®SWARD HOI and Arthur Conan Doyle's\nRODNEY STONE (these two running a total of 13 weeks). You may wish to program all\nthree serials in the same \"slot.\" If It proves feasible, we shall follow these\nthree with a fourth serial of the same type (probably LORNA DOONE).\nYou may wish to keep track of the following deadlines for ordering BBC series\nfrom the NAEB Radio Network:\n55-36 THE BBC THEATRE\n55-37 THE ELIZABETHAN THEATRE\n55- 38 THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR\n56- 1 SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL\n56-2 NICHOLAS NICKLEBY\n56-3 WESTWARD HOI\n56—li RODNEY STONE\nSeptember 2, 1955\nSeptember 2, 1955\nOctober 7, 1955\nDecember 2, 1955\nDecember 2, 1955\nDecember 2, 1955\nJanuary 13, 1956\nYou may, of course, order at any time before these dates. But we would appre¬\nciate there being no late orders, as we begin the mass duplication of the recordings\nshortly after the deadlines.\nWe hope you will find in this offering much material which you can use. Thank\nyou for your attention.\nAugust 9, 1955"
