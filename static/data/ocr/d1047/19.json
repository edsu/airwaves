Hurlbert\nAlabama Educational TV Commission\n807 Protective Life Building\nBirmingham, Alabama\nDear Raymond:\nNo, none of your communications have gone astray; it's\njust that I hoped to have more specific Information at\nmy command before responding.\nFirst, about the Japan trip. As I believe Harry told you,\nwe have occasionally made funds available for foreign\ntravel in cases where NAEB members were already abroad so\nthat slight additional funds enabled them (Paulu, Schwarz-\nwalder) to represent us at broadcasting conferences in\ntheir vicinity. We have never used NAEB funds to help\nsomeone go abroad and I am sure you can appreciate why\nthis policy is necessary.\nSo we hope to be able to find some sort of nesting you\ncould attend or service you could perform in connection\nwith your proposed trip. Bob Underwood, I understand,\nhas written to contacts in Tokyo and Honolulu. I will\ncontact NEA, which keeps a master schedule of edcuational\nconferences, about possible meetings. I will also check\nwith Keith Tyler, who has been working with Japanese\nbroadcasters, about possible angles in that country.\nWeâ€™ll find something.\nI will honor your request not to be named again as\nChairman of the Membership Committee but I do so with\ngreat regret. You have done an outstanding job in this\nresponsibility and largely as the result of your vigorous\nleadership the membership has had an unprecedented growth"
