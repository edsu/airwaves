Chadeayns\nStation JCETC\n69^ 6 Millbrook Boulevard\nSt. Louis 5, Missouri\nDear Henry:\nI’ve forwarded your bill for payment at one® for the Washington meeting.\nMighty pleased to have you there to help hold things on the track.\nthe Fuad letter regarding our grant request was a real shock to ma too. I got\nit on Saturday and spent the rest of the day humping into things. 1 tried call¬\ning Pauiu and Hdll and finally got them yesterday. I*d guess we now talk\nabout parts-i.e. the interim type, preferably more than one year but in¬\ncluding even only one year renewal of what we now have —- or less. I think\nunless they feel terribly negative about us that enough of what we have should\nbe continued at least long enough so we can let personnel to whom we're\ncommitted (like Bidlack) make other plans • The same applies to projects al¬\nready undertaken. If U else fails, we'll need to request permission to use\nremaining funds, as a common pool, for the next few months« Those, st least,\nwere ay suggestions to Dick, for phone call to Kelson which I expect he has\nmade by now.\nIf you have or get any clues any place, please feed 'em in. My thinking is:\n(1) We were told two years ago to apply to the Ford Foundation itself. Our\ngrants have been from these*. Yet we get our answers from and appointments\nwith Fund for the Advancement, whose objectives, 1 fear, are less broad.\nHaving tailored our proposal to at Weiss' suggestions leaves me confused\nbut feeling that we're caught between their own jurisdictional differences of\nthinking-where we're too broad in approach for the Fund, but cut off from\nthe Foundation as a direct channel.\n(2) That they want to support projects instead of associations, which they\nmay feel (however wrongly) should or can be member-supported.\n(3) That our former (Fund for Adult Education) orientation (controversy, etc.)\nisn’t what they like."
