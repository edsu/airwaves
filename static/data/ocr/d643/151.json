  "text": "PRESIDENTS C0LT3MN\nI have attended a great many meetings of the NAEB Board of\nDirectors since first becoming an officer of the Association in\n19^9e By all odds * however, the best of these were the meetings\nat the St. Louis convention on October 28, 29* and 30, and in\nChicago on December 6, 7* and 8.\nThese sessions were devoted to the basic problems of\neducational radio and television broadcasting. This fact is\nimportant in itself, since it is always easy to lose the ^grand\ndesign* among the minutiae. But what impressed me even more was\nthe way in which the Board concentrated on the overall problems\nof educational broadcasting, and never on those of NAEB\nalone.\nAt tbs St* Louis meeting we became very much aware of the\nrecent emergence of new problems in educational broadcasting. We\nalso realized that it would be impossible to discuss these adequately\nduring our short time together? too many routine matters were\npressing for action! furthermore, the Convention itself was at\nhand. Accordingly, we decided to hold a special meeting in\nChicago on December 6, 7* end 8,\nThere the Board of Directors was joined by other IJAEB\nmembers chosen to make the session widely representative. Added\nto the group were? the secretary-elect (Haskell Boyter)| two\nmembers from the permanent finance committee (William Harley and\nEdward Rosenheim)! one member from the committee set up by the\nETRC affiliates to represent them to the Center (James Robertson)!\nNAEBss legal counsel (Leonard Marks)| and the Executive and\nAssociate Executive Directors of NAEB (Harry J. Skornla and\nHarold Hill.)"
