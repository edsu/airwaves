Job, as is. is to be a Job for sure\nuntil June 1C, 1956. In other words, for three years more from July 1,\n1953. It might go longer, with present arrangements extended, or it\nmight be changed when Foundation support runs out,\nWhen filled, we went whoever takes it to take it for the duration.\nThe position carries no tenure. It pays in the neighborhood of\n$10,000,\nFrankly, if at all possible, we want to fill it before May 15. Other\nthings being more or less equal, it might be held open until May 15,\nor thereabouts. They might have to stoop bo low as to allow me to\nfill in on interim term.\nMiles is leaving no later than February 1, because he must return to\nPurdue (good ol* Purdue, beat us in football, 4(V12). So the Miles\nangle need not concern you. Presently, Jim and Elizabeth and Hickey\nare living here, living in a University house so we can have It on\nFebruary 1 if position is filled by that time.\nNow as to the Indiana situation. Frankly, I don*t know whether I\nshould write the following or not# but I shall so that you may have\nthe best picture possible for your own good. I passed along your\nmessage to Elmer. He said to tell you he appreciated them words,\nand also asked me to tell you that your work of the past was making\nhis Job much easier now."
