Now I would like\nto get some NAEB business rolling*\nWill you please give me a briefing on the total\nrelationship of the president to the headquarters operation\ns seen from the position of the Executive Director. As\nyou know, I have been in on all the Board meetings in\ndetermining policy, etc., but the details of operation be¬\ntween you and Si are not included in my knowledge of the\nsituation. Specifically I need to know which, if any,\noperational details are approved by the president, how\nthe funds provided for the president*s secretary, telephone\ncalls, etc. are handled between you and Frank. At the\npost-session meeting in Minneapolis the Board authorised\n1100.00 per month for secretarial help fcr my office and the\n1500 contingency fund which has been approved for Si. I\noo not know how these funds have been handled, so please\ninform me.\nAt our advance meetings several actions were\ntaken which gave specific directives to the incoming\npresident* I would appreciate your giving me a rundowi\non those as soon as possible - perhaps even before you\nget the minutes completed for distribution to the Board.\nNow that you are both Mr. Secretary and Mr.\nExecutive Secretary, what is your next deadline for a\nnewsletter and what specific contributions would you like\nfrom me for that newsletter*\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W.
