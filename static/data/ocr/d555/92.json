The purpose of\nthis series is to give a ’’report1* on the major battles of the Civil War as seen\nby a specific Michigan regiment* In the series the South is treated sympathetically5\nnevertheless, the primary point of view is Northern, and the focus of attention is\nplaced on Northern troops.\nThe material for the series is taken directly from official records, regimental\nhistories, and Adjutant Generals’s reports. The consultant is E. E* Barthell,\nauthor of the Civil War section in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\nAlthough great stress is placed on the role of Michigan troops in the war, it was\nfelt that the series would be of general interest in many other areas of the\ncountry. Nowhere is the impression given to the impartial listener that Michigan\nwon the war without assistance.\nSince this series is based on rigid research, and since the topic of the series\nis of great interest in many parts of the country, this series is offered as a\nbonus series.\nProgram\nIssue\nTopic\n1.\n1\nBull Run (July, 1861)\n2.\n2\nShiloh (April, 1862)\n3.\n3\nCapture of New Orleans (April, 18<\n4#\n4\nSeven Days’ Battle (July, 1862)\n5.\n5\nDetroit Draft Riot (August, 1862)\n6.\n6\nAntietam (September, 1862)\n7.\n7\nPerryville (October, 1862)\n8.\n8\nFredericksburg (December, 1862)\n9.\n9\nStone’s River (December, 1862)\n10.\n10\nVicksburg (June, 1863)\n11.\n11\nChancellorsville (May, I863)"
