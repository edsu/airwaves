Yet, again, we have to be cautious. Historical\nEXPERIENCE MUST INDUCE CAUTION. POLITICAL PRINCIPLES\nARE SUBJECT TO A REMARKABLE DEGREE OF TWISTING AND\nTURNING. From the SAME general political doctrine me\nARE CAPABLE OF DEDUCING THAT ALL SHOULD BE FREE, OUT\nALSO OF DEDUCING THAT A GREAT NUMBER SHOULD BE SLAVES\nReligion, too, can be used as for example it has been\nused in South Africa, to justify a very subordinate\nstatus for a colored population.
