Jim Mies\n119 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nTear Jims\nThanks very much for the nice work in planning the agenda,\nis far s I can tell at a brief runthrough, you have covered all\nthe matters which we decided upon at the Oklahoma meeting and\nthe organization is very good. Tou have overlooked leaving a\nspot for ialph Steetle on the agenda and I've asked him to\nshow uj> ihursday morning if at all possible, oi called Saturday\nto say that Fletcher will not be in until the evening of April 17.\nIt now appears that we will have to docge the general session and\nmeet with Fletcher for that entire evening period. I have a\ncall in far Fletcher now to verify Si's statement that he will\nbe thes e i/rurscay ni ;ht and will not be at the luncheon Friday.\n(At M's suggestion, I will send you a bill for some, as well as\ntwo or three other calls v iich I have had to make in connection\nwith this mee&ing of the Boar a.)\n.y i raise one juration concerning your session number 3*\nIt would $eem to me that you would be the logical person rataer\nthan urton to le d the discussion on \"Budget, Flans, Personnel\nfor eRd iuarte s and Tape etwork”, though it is not a matter of\ngreat importance.\nlien I found out that Fletcher would not be with us, I\ncalled AI Gaines to have him oo a reprint on the announcements\nwhich he had prepared concerning the u. 3 luncheon. e informed\nme thi t it looked highly improbable that he %#ould be able to\nattend the Board meeting because there is absolutely no money\navailable for the trip from nis school system and he cannot\nafford the trip out of his own pocket. I had a note from Burton\na few days ago raising the question of funos available for Board\nexpenses to attend the session, hows tio defray « flnnri.\nprr-fonli-^rr ay 1 ^ , i Is it conceivable that\nwe can find four or five nunorea dollars to help carry the freight\non this Board meeting for those members of the board w ose\ninstitutions will not carry the load? If you think it can be\ndone, let mo know by return mail or give me a ring so I can get\nin touch with Al ant Burton*\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
