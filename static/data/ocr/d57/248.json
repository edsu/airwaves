A\nnumber of last minute pressures conspired to make this\nimpossible. Just at the moment my lecture schedule is\nextremely tight - I‘m talking almost every day and sometimes\ngiving two major speeched a day. However, I do see ahead\nof me an entirely free day while I am at Madison and I shall\nrecord them then - either at the University if they have a\nradio station or at the local cotimercial station. That\nis within a week, so you should not have to wait for them\nfor too much longer.\nWith aplogies,\nSincerely yours\nFelix Greene\nMr Robert E. Underwood, Jr.\nNetwork Manager,\nN.A.E.B.,\nUrbana, Ill\nP.S. My schedule is so close that I doubt very much whether\nI shall be able to stop off and see you at Urbana. I regret\nthis. I was looking forward to making your acquaintance."
