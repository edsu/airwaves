May 18th.\nWe did the show yesterday, and it is quite a lavish\none, about $30,000, and I am very much in hope that it\nwill be possible to interest one of the American networks\nin using it. Please help toward this end, because if we\nsucceed the CBC would be very much disposed to go ahead\nwith a whole series on the media. The group that did this\nshow underwent, as it were, a long seminar with me and\nare quite excited about the whole thing. It is not going\nto be easy to get release of this video for educational\nuses until it has defrayed some of its cost commercially.\nSpent two hours to-day with the Electrical Engineering\nDivision here who are quite confident that ny approach to\nthe media via the senses can be transferred to Systems\nDevelopment charts. In fact they said it is possible to\nput any one of our senses on a computer so that by stepping\nup or diminishing input (the parameters of intensity) any\none sense could be translated into any one other sense\ninstantaneously, and all the phenomena of all the media\ndescribed and predicted. This possibility had never occucred\nto any of these people before today, but as soon as they saw\nmy charts they said they could do it. They are quite excited.\nSo we shall be hard at it next week when I get back from\nBoston. Hope to see many people beside David Riesman, Henry\nMbrray and Siegfried Giedion about media matters. I do want\nto get you to see the overall meaning of the electronic\nexternalization of our entire sensorium. What this means Harry\nis a world within a world in a totally new way. When all of\nur senses are globally enveloping all of our senses you have"
