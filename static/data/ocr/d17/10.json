But\nobviously I cannot agree with your view that the Fulbright\nscholarships have as high a priority. After all the Fulbright\nscholars are drawing down $8000/9000 a year from Government\nfunds whereas we are putting out funds of our own in order to\nproperly represent the organization.\nInsofar as the choice for the Prix Italia is concerned, I wrote\nto Burton and explained that after seve ral of us had listened\nto his show, we felt that the \"Ways of Mankind'â€™ program\nA word in your Ear was so far and away superior that it would\nbe the ideal programto submit.\nWith all best wishes, believe me,1\nCordially yours.\nSeymour N. Siegel\nDirector"
