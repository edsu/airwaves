This would give\nworld opinion on various world or national\nhappenings. Tapes and scripts could be sent to\nall radio and television stations, mimeographed\ndigests or boilerplate to all newspapers. The\npurpose of this project is to reveal what the\nopinion in other nations is.\nJOINT COMMITTEE ON EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION\nThis would allow for continued and expanded opera¬\ntions by this group. The great need next year\nwill be to get educational television stations\non the air.\nTELEVISION PROGRAM EXPERIMENT (AT WOI)\nThe proposal would be broadened this year to\nallow WOI to explore television’s potential and\nextend the institution’s part in adult education.\nInternships for staff members from other institu¬\ntions would be included.\nJOURNAL OF RADIO-TELEVISION EDUCATION\nThis would voice philosophical and practical ideas\non uses of the media for education, handling things\nin more detail and for more permanent uses than the\nNewsletter is generally capable of.\nAREAS FOR EXPLORATION BY FUND FOR ADULT EDUCATION\nThe Committee felt that NAEB should urge founda¬\ntions to experiment in many areas of television\nuses. For example; possible establishment of a\nNational Television Foundation which would help\ninstitutions get into television; possible estab¬\nlishment of a National Educational Television Pro¬\ngramming Production Center; and an experiment in\neducational uses of subscription television (Phone-\nvision, etc.), perhaps in Chicago where Zenith\nalready has the mechanical facilities <>\nTOTAL FOR OTHER TELE¬\nVISION PROJECTS\n1300,000.00\n150,000.00\n250,000.00\n25,000.00\n(No estimate sub¬\nmitted in these\nareas.)\nS725.000.00\n>1.300.000,00\nGRAND TOTAL"
