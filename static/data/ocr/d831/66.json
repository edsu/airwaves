It may be even less than that\nbecause of possll^ extra expenses at Ohio# I hope that the money imy be\nreleased, howeftor, right after the fisrt of the year#\nI»ll try to clear some of the other matters you asked about, but I hoiiestly\ndonH have the answers to all of questions#\nLast year the Board of Directors appointed the following people to the\nResearch Committees Adkins, Becker, Cheydleur, Coleman, Harwood,i49rrlll,\nand Tyler# Because of other NABB duties, Coleman asked to be relieved of the\nChalnaanship# I knew nothing id>out Bob<8 thinking on the matter and it wouldn’t\nhave made any difference how X felt about It because the only board member I\nknew happens to be Earl ^^ynn-^bat out of it all I received a letter frtwi Paulu\nasking m to serve as Chairman#\nX was then Informed that tliere were changes on the oonsolttee mendsersMp and I\nassume that the changes were made by the Board Itself# Had X been asked I would\nnot have appointed two of the people new serving, although this is a personal\nmatter and I know you will keep It as such#\nX assume that a new Chalzwi was splinted at St# Louis this year and perhaps\nnew cocsnlttee members, although X have no Idea what action was taken# However,\nIt Is a matter of record that several months ago X wrote to the President and\nthe Bixecutlve Director, s^ng that X thought 1) ippointments should be mde In\nFebruaiy Instead of January 1, in order to eliminate soma of the oonflic$» on\ngrants and 2) tliat X thought It was dbout time to appoint a Chairman idx) was fully\ntrained In this areal\nThis doesn’t really answer your question as to why you aren’t on the committee\nbut at least It clears the air and shows that It wasn’t thrbugh any action of\nmine-«»-or any suggestion of mine, Larry#"
