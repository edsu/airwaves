  "text": "April 15, 1957\nMr. Elmer G. **ulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Mr. Sulzer:\nThank you very much for your letter of April 11 regarding the NAEB Fhct Sheet\nService subscription. I have corrected my records as you requested in your\nletter. However, because mail, when addressed to a department rather than an\nindividual, is often lost, our NAEB Fact Sheet Service will continue to be\nsen# directly to Mr. Lynch as has been the case in tsar last few mailings.\nAs was mentioned in ny first letter, the University of Illinois will soon be\nsending you a bill for $2.50 for the 1957 service. This too, will probably\ncome addressed to Mr. Lynch. I will, however, advise the University billing\ndepartment to change their records accordingly.\nI am sorry you have been bothered by all this detail, Mr. Sulzer, and I hope\nit will not occur again.\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to call on me.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Judith B Gans\nSecretary"
