In America this in¬\ncludes mother and father and - on the average - perhaps one sister and one brother.\nThe five or six of you lived together in a house or apartment separate from anyone\nelse. It is unlikely but possible that there was some other relative included in\nthat family.\nYou think of this group as your family. If you are married, you are now think¬\ning of your wife or husband and your children as being your family. You use the\nword differently sometimes. All of the relatives that you keep in contact with you\nsometimes think of as your family. But you don't form a unit, and except in times\nof severe crisis, don't burden them with your problems.\nChinese Family\nIf you were born in a Chinese peasant village,the whole matter would be differ¬\nent. Your family would include your father and mother, yourself and your children.\nThere would probably be an aunt or uncle living with you, and your brothers would\nalso be a part of the family. Your wife and your brothers' wives are a part of your\nfamily. This whole group would share its economic means and work as a unit.\nIf you were an Iroquois Indian,the family would consist of about a dozen units\nmore or less like our own family, all living together in a \"long house\". The women\nin these units would all be sisters, or mothers and daughters, for Iroquois reckon\nkinship through the women. They would work the same land together, though each hus¬\nband and wife would have a separate portion of the longhouse. You would probably\nfeel pretty much as an outsider to this group, just as a Chinese bride for a long\ntime feels a stranger to her family.\nExperimental Discussion Program\nSubject to Revision"
