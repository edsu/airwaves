Let the LTV organization take LTV station activation, financial\nsupport, public relations and research as its prime functions.\nc. Create a third organization or branch for the drones which\ncould pass resolutions, listen to exhortations, give scrolls\nto worthy elders, conduct long-winded seminars, write long\neditorials and short articles and generally make its members\nfeel important and useful. This organization could also\nconduct a yearly amateur theatrical for its own amusement.\nAll of this gives you some idea of my thoughts on the NAEB and what\nshould be done. I hope it will be useful to you.\nSine erely,\n/â– /\nJohn C. Schwarzwalder\nGeneral Manager\ncopied KUON-TV\n5-5-58 (et)"
