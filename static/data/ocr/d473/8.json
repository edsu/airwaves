I\nbelieve that this will defray all existing obligations and, at the\nsame time, more than provide the 4% administration charge\nfor the entire grant.\nMr. Bernays informs me that \"should there eventually turn out\nto be any other expenses, we would, of course, be glad to take\ncare of them when they turn up, in line with our understanding. \"\nI presume that it would be possible to obtain from you an accounting\naccording to your records of all of the expenditures so that a reÂ¬\nport can be made to the Bernays Foundation.\nWith all best wishes, believe me,\nsns/be\nenc."
