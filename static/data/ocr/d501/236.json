  "text": "- 9 -\nrehashes of Communist attacks upon the Voice* the great majority of the com®\nments reflect strong interest and approval* Some indicate a change of po-\nlitical sympathies attributable to VOA influence. (One Italian sent his Com®\nmunist Party membership card to VOA when he became a convinced anti-Communist,)\nPerhaps the most affecting testimony is that which comes from the few letters\nsmuggled through the Iron Curtain* One of these sums up the meaning of VOA\nbroadcasts as follows;\nwThose who listen to the Voice of America are risking im¬\nprisonment and even death. But this does not frighten us from\nlistening. On the contrary* it builds up our courage to take\nthis risk* You will ask me why. Because the Voice is our daily\nbreads it is the elixir which builds up our strength and rein¬\nforces our hope for a better future* free of fear.,.0M\nOther informed testimony comes from Dr. Marek Korowicz* member of the\nPolish delegation to the UN who defected in New York in September 1953* On\nbeing asked whether the Voice of America was heard in Poland* he replied\nthat it was, r,by millions and millions of Poles” and continued;\n\"It is a real sanctuary for the oppressed people and the news\nbroadcasts from this service go from mouth to mouth* so that even\nthose people who do not have radio receiving stations /sets7 in a\nfew hours learn the latest news*,.. I might best /indicate impact\nof V0A7 by quoting to you a slogan which is /heard7 throughout my\ncountry; %There are only two moral sanctuaries for the oppressed\npeople of my country: the Church and the American broadcasts.*\"\nJanuary \\9$h"
