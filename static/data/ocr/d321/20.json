I wired Parker Wheatley asking for dubs and he answered\nthat the series was being offered to NAEB.\nWe are most anxious to have these talks, and I hope you will find\nit possible to release them immediately. 1 realize that the\nNetwork is operating near capacity, ibut I for one would certainly\nagree to substitution of the Stevenson talks for some of the\nseries now bjsing distributed. I guess this is impractical, but\nwe really doi want the talks â€¢ I am beggingl Parker Wheatley to let\nus have them right now, but if he can*t do;, that I do hope NAEB\nwill find it.possible to release them in the near future.\nSincerely,\n(Signed) John Young\nJohn Young\nManager !\nJY 8\nChapel Hill\nNAEB Headquarters\nCopy made Mar .17, 1954'"
