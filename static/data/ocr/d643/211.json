Stanley\nProgram Associate\nEducational Television and Radio Center\n2320 Washtenaw Avenue\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Ray,\nI have before me my carbon copy of your June 21 letter to Harry\nSkornia in which you suggest that we give you our ideas about the Current\nOpportunities Fund*\nAn you know, I hare bad to resign as *AEB president in order to\nprepare By stu$r year in Europe, which will run fro* September, 1958.\n+ L overtheless, I would like to say that, in my opinion,\nthis Current Opportunities Fund has been a very excellent thing.\nWe obtained an allocation from it at the Universitv of Minnesota to\nmake some radio programs out of the materials which are noion to be\ncollected by a dozen University of Minnesota faculty members who, on\nrather short notice, received a grant for a month's trip to the Soviet\nUnion in ooptembor. This is exactly the kind of thing for which the\nCurrent Opportunities Fund was established, and I think in ttas case\nthat it will pay off, by making it possible for us to develop some\nunusual WB programs which otherwise would have been unavailable. On\nthe basis of our experience, therefore, 1 endorse this very strongly.\nHowever, I leave details to next, wear's foundation, and grants-in-aid,\ncoiambtees, *\n- ff s^n president, may I thank you personally-, Rav,\n?t4?r!fci°\" g*^ 40 ,TA,?B Pr°bl«M this year. I think that\nNAEB-mO relationships improved a good deal in recent months, and that\nyour devotion to the cause was one reason for this.\nTour® sincerely,\nbp tiak\ncc: Dr. iSarry J, Skornia\n[/■\nBurton Paulu\nVisiting Professor\nDepartment of Telecommunications"
