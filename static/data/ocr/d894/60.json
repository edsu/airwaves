  "text": "-2-\nContra-wise, I haven’t heard of any one radio station or network which has\nplaced its microphones before the witnesses and the Commission in this hearing\nroom (as has been done at other non-radio Congressional hearings) in order to\nbring to its listeners the different points of view expressed here on these\nbasic, vital and important issues.\nThus far, the witnesses who have appeared here have assumed that the\nMayflower decision prohibits a licensee, as such, but no other person from\nusing the licensee’s microphone, for the purpose of editorializing. Innumerable\nwitnesses who have appeared here have referred to the phrase from the Mayflower\ndecision which reads; \"The broadcaster cannot be an advocate.\" I submit that\nthe interpretation given to that phrase by most of the other witnesses Is\nnarrow, illogical and unreal.\nFirst of all, let us remember that in that decision the station that was\ninvolved did not editorialize through the presentation of the licensee himself,\nbut rather through a paid employee -- an editor-in-chief of the station’s news\ndepartment. I submit that it would have made no difference in the result of\nthat case, or In the language used by the Commission in that opinion, if the\nviews had been expressed not by a paid employee, but by an independent con¬\ntractor, a person who drew no pay or salary, or by the licensee himself. When\nthe Commission spoke of a broadcaster not being an advocate, it seems to me\nthat the use of the word \"broadcaster\" was not intended to be limited to mean\nthe licensee himself standing before a microphone. The word \"station\" should\nhave been used instead of the word \"broadcaster\". A station cannot be an\nadvocate.\nI had always assumed that not only were stations prohibited from being\nadvocates, but that there was some Commission rule, regulation or decision"
