Several school teachers who par¬\nticipated in one group reported they decided to stay in the community rather than\naccept offers of employment elshwere, because they enjoyed the friendship of the\npeople brought together through their ’’Ways of Mankind” group.\n4. The participants rediscovered, in many cases, radio as a valuable way of\nspending leisure time.\n5. The stimulus to think. Many people reported they had \"gotten out of the\nhabit” of thinking or talking about serious matters. They found the intellectual\nexercise enjoyable. One woman said;\n\"Before this experiment started I used to talk to my neighbor over\nthe fence on my left about her flower garden. I used to talk with\nmy neighbor on the right over the fence about our children's diets\nand the condition of their \"b.m.’s”J Now at last I have something\nI really want to talk about.”\n6. a growing appreciation of the people of other cultures. One man reported\nhe had never before \"understood anything about the people of other societies.\" He\nhad thought them \"different\" and therefore, \"odd\";\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese appear to be the main experiences gained from the \"Ways of Mankind\"\nExp riment.\n1.

A carefully selected radio program, designed to touch off the\nnatural well-springs of human interest and concern will lead to discussion as vital\nand penetrating as that of a carefully organized graduate seminar."
