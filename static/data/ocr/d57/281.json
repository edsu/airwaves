With others I appealed to the nuclear powers to come\nto an agreement to stop the tests as soon as possible at the same\ntime declaring their genuine desire to renounce the use of atomic\nweapons.\nAt the time there was a reasonable hope that this step\nwould be taken. It was not to be. The negotiations led by Mr,\nHarold Stassen in London last summer between The United States-,\nachieved in nothing. The conference arranged by the United Nations\nin the autumn of last year suffered the same fate, as the Soviet\nUnion withdrew from the discussions.\nThe Soviet Union has recently proposed a disarmament plan,\non the basis of which apparently discussions are being planned. As\na first step the plan presupposes that nuclear tests should cease\nimmediately,\n1/Vhat chanses have this condition of being fulfilled ?\nOne might have thought to agree on this point would be easy for all\nthose involved. None of them would have to sacrifice any of the\natomic weapons in their possession, and the handicap of not being\nable to try out new ones would be the same for all.\nEven so the proposal is difficult for the United States\nand Britain to accept. They spoke against it when the matter was\ndiscussed in the spring af 1957. Since then ceaseless propaganda has\nbeen directed against the view that the radiation following nuclear\ntests is so dangerous that it is necessary to stop them, ThB American\nand European Press is constantly receiving abundant propaganda material\nsupplied by governmental atomic commissions and scientists, who feel\ncalled upon to support this view."
