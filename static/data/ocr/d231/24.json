In the fields of government, law, medicine, science, education, etc.\nUntil regional networks, if not a live national educational network, are capable\nof Instantaneous transmission of dated materials, the NAEB Radio Network will\ndistribute more and more timely programs with all possible speed to member\nstations.\nThe picture is. Indeed, a bright one. However, as Mr. Underwood indica¬\nted earlier, there is still a long way to go and the success of the NAEB net¬\nwork is still dependent on the support of the NAEB members, both in a financial\nand in a program way. New series, drawing upon the resources of our educational\nInstitutions, produced with or without financial assistance, are needed. More\ncreative thinking and experimentation In production techniques are needed.\nGreater attention must be given to the technical quality of recorded programs.\nIt Is an unfortunate commentary on our limitations even In this year of en¬\nlightenment that the network still receives for audition and for distribution\nprograms so Inferior in technical quality that they must be rejected. It is\nthis committee’s hope that its choice of programs and Its efforts to stimulate\nnew programs will lead to increased stature for NAEB as a whole and, with\nthe cooperation of its members, will help to dispel the parochialism, conserva¬\ntism and complacency to which all of us are subject from time to time.\nE. G. Burrows\nChairman"
