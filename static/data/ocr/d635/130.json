Now I would like\nto get some NAEB business rolling.\nWill you please give me a briefing on the total\nrelationship of the president to the headquarters operation\nas seen from the position of the Executive Director. As\nyou know, I have been in on all the Board meetings in\ndetermining policy, etc •, but the details of operation be¬\ntween you and Si are not included in my knowledge of the\nsituation. Specifically I need to know which, if any,\noperational details are approved by the president, how\nthe funds provided for the presidents secretary, telephone\ncalls, etc. are handled between you and Frank. At the\npost-session meeting in Minneapolis the Board authorized\n$100.00 per month for secretarial help far my office and the\n$5 pOiltf* contingency fund which has been approved for Si. I\ndo not know how these funds have been handled, so please\ninform me. #\nAt our advance meetings/Jseveral actions were\ntaken which gave specific directives to the incoming\npresident. I would appreciate your giving me a rundown\non those as soon as possible - perhaps even before you\nget the minutes completed for distribution to the Board.\nNow that you are both Mr. Secretary and Mr.\nExecutive Secretary, what is your next deadline for a\nnewsletter and what specific contributions would you like\nfrom me for that newsletter.\nWe hope to have a meeting of a pre-planning\nor strategy committee in the very near future at the\nUniversity of Illinois. I have not decided the exact\ngroup nor the total number of people that I will call to\nthat meeting nor the exact date. I wonder, however.\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
