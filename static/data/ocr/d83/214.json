The overwhelming superiority of Austrian\nscholarship in higher studies dates from that experiment,\naccording to Polanyi.\nSo far as ray media studies are concerned, the Mechanization\nTakes Command by Siegfried Giedion is indispensable background\nfor the Ianguages of media. As soon as one approaches a\nfield, one has to abandon subjects. Or rather, subjects are\nautomatically included within the field. Such is the bias of\nprint in America that even Dewey, while trying to say this,\ncouldn*t see it.\nMore soon.\nCordially, ,\nhmm/rn\nEnclosures."
