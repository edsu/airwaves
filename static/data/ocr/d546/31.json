C.\nDear Harold,\nYou111 pardon me while I enthuse, but it would be\nimpossible to try to hide the thrill and excitement\ncaused by your recent letter. So why bother in the\nfirst place?\nI am both happy and proud-a bit awed as well-\nto have been asked to become Research Editor for the\nNAEB Journal. The only hesitation about accepting is\nwhether or not I can do the job that needs to be done.\nIt»s a big responsibility, but also a challenge that\nwhets my appetite. So, I accept, and hope to justify\nyour confidence in me.\nIncidentally, as you must know already, I am\nleaving Wayne State to join the faculty at Ohio Uni¬\nversity in Athens this fall. It looks like an ex¬\nciting year ahead.\nSincerely,\nPresley D. Holmes, Jr.\nDirector of Research\nPDH/cw"
