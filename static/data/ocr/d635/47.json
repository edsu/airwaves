This report might very well be made to the Executive\nC nmittee at the Oklahoma meeting so we could thrash out a lot of\nideas and -then present the whole thing to the Board at the Columbus\nmeeting in the form of recommendations from the Executive Committee#\nVie can thrash out the Columbus agenda at the Oklahoma meeting\nbut it seems worthwhile to me for us to be thinking about it this far\nin advance.\nKWSC, State College of\nWashington\nPullman, Washington\nMontana, Washington, California,\nIdaho, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona,\nUtah and Territory of Hawaii.\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W.

Roll this around and let us come up with an\nannouncement soon.
