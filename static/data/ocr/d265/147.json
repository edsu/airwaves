In the conservative reaction which fol¬\nlowed French excesses it was to their partisan advantage to make him appear a\ndangerous man. Historians in our own day rarely show this sort of partisanship,\nhut some of them have given a false impression by laying too much emphasis on\ncertain vivid and highly quotable expressions of Jefferson's which have been\ntaken from their context. One of the most interesting of these is: \"The tree\nof liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and\ntyrants\". This famous quotation was taken from a private letter, written before\nthe French Revolution. The significance of the saying in its actual context of\nplace and time is discussed in Jefferson and the Rights of Man, pp. 165-166, and\nJefferson's early attitude toward the French Revolution is considered in the In¬\ntroduction to that volume, pp. xvi-xviii. References to later comments on the\nFrench Revolution are given in the suggestions for reading that are attached to\nthis program. Jefferson's attitude cannot be judged from a few passages, however;\nfor he never discussed these matters systematically. It has to be judged in the\nlight of his full career.\nThe Communist arguments in the radioscript are drawn from no single source.\nThe scriptwriter had recently been working on a Russian program and was very\nfamiliar with the workings of the Communist mind. For the convenience of those\nwho would like to look into the history, theory and practice of Communism, a\nfew titles are given in the \"Suggested Reading\".\nExperimental Discussion Program Subject to Revision\n55"
