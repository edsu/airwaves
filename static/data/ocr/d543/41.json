  "text": "Estimate of Financial Future\nHerewith an estimate of income and expenditures from all presently known source a until\nDecember 31, 1963, This of course includes no foundation grants, since none are currently\nexpected, or in negotiation. It assumes that any increases (of a minor nature) in income\nfrom more members or more Network members will be offset, in part at least, by the. increased\ncost of servicing -these members, as well as other steadily rising operational costs. No\nadditional staff is provided for, and no \"Washington move\" expenses are included, and no\nsalary increases are listed. In other words, all figures given have been based on present\nbudgets. During the course of the present three-year grant from Kellogg, tbs MSB is\ncommitted to contribute, from its own income, the following amounts to the budget of the\nHeadquarters operations 1959,*60 — *09>165J 1960-61 •» (>19*165$ 1961s62 — 029>165, On the\nbasis of present operations it is calculated that only 04,165, annually, of the sums\nT&etied can be expected to accrue from the Urbana (essentially the Network) operation.
