TOM SAWYER—yes, two to one* You know the views of\nthe others* I am persuaded \"yes,” for I believe the\nproduction to be good and the interpretation sufficient¬\nly good to make this a worthwhile addition to the Net*s\noffering*\n2. DYNAMICS OP DEMOCRACY—Yes. (It*3 Cooper Union,\nisn* t it?1)\n3* THE AGING IN EUROPE—We have two positive votes on\nthis one. Slack*s having been transmitted earlier* I\nhad a difficult time with this one for a myriad of\nreasons. In the final analysis I decided yes because\nof the significance of the topic covered and because\nof the dearth of programming available to this audience*\n4* I shall shortly discontinue my association with WUOT,\nand, therefore, the NAEB. It has been a pleasure serving\non this committee and working with each of you. I am\nthis date advising Schooley of my action."
