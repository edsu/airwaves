Skornia,\nNAEB,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, ill.\n-Dear Harry:\njload newsf thanks jto Jim Finn, Following up his Systems\nDevelopment que, I chased over to our Engineering Department\non my return from Cincinnati and explained my media charts.\nThey said, at once: \"Yes, we have a lot of models and systems\nthat would take that kind of information flow. We have found,\nstrangely, a lot of examples of reversal of flow in various\nsaturation situations\". So we shall get down to work at\nonce to test my media principles by analogue computer and\nother systems. This does make sense, doesn*t it? Up to now,\nour snapshoting technique of media performance offered no\nmeans of studying transformation and metamorphosis resulting\nfrom information input.\nThe flaw I suspect in all our \"content\" approaches to\nmedia is the result of not noticing that phonetic writing\nand printing involved not one, but two media at once. After\n3500 years of being exposed to speech within a visual code,\nit is natural to talk about content of various situations,\neven though it is meaningless to talk about the content of\nmusic, painting, film and, indeed, any medium that is a single\nmedium. Chinese Ideogram and Egyptian Heiroglyph do not\nfoster the content approach at all. Moreover, the ever shift¬\ning and precarious balance which has always existed between\nspeech and visual code in the Western world has meant that\nany change in our technology has tended to break them apart,\ncreating both speaking and reading difficulties in ever new\npatterns.\nGlen McCrackenfs experiment hit upon a technique of\nvulcaniziang this ancient pair for a few more years.\nVery best.\nHMM/RN\no .c.
