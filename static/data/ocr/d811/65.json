Skornia, Exec, Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUniyersity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nThe planning which you and your friends have been doing with\nrespect to Teacher Training and Professional Standards Develop¬\nment is indeed fine. I have enjoyed reading your proposal and\nalthough we can not give it serious consideration,, I do hope\nthat you are able some how to bring it into your program.\nAs we review our support to this field of interest, we think it\nwise to limit our aid at the present time to the project which\nwe recently approved for the general support of the NAEB. We\nare just sorry that we do not ha\\e sufficient funds so that we could\nbe of greater aid to your Association. As I have probably explained\nto you, our big problem is that we have presented to us so many\nwonderful proposals.\nSincerely and with best wishes,\n7n-\nMaurice F.
