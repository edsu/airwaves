I don’t see how freedom of speech enters into the\nquestion of the broadcaster’s right to use a facility, a wave length, over\nwhich he has monopoly, in the interest of expressing his own opinions.\nIt would seem to me that he is not at all shut off any more than anyone\nelse from the regular channels of freedom of expression.\nMr. Howell:\nI would just like to ask Mr. Griffin if he means that he is opposed\nto the broadcaster’s having equal access to his own facilities along with\nthe other members of the general public. Do you believe, then, that a\nclarification of that particular language of the Mayflower decision\nis in order?\nMr. Griffin:\nI think, Mr. Howell, you raised the difficulty that worries most of\nus when you pointed out that, in those abundantly desirable things\nyour own station did, you said: “the listeners had faith in us and had\nfaith in the station.” Therefore, the listeners gave more support and\nmore attention to your statement of the situation.\nI don’t think there would be any difficulty with the Commission in\nyour case.

The man who heard that\ncase is now dead.\nI don’t think the Mayflower decision should have been written\nas it stands.\nI think it should have been thrown into the ashcan rather than re¬\nleased. I think the Federal Communications Commission still ought to\nsay something that would indicate they do not feel bound by the decision.\nThe decision went all out in left field. It didn’t decide the case on\nthe record. It simply set up a prerequisite for someone to meet before\nhe could get a license.
