Shelley, Executive Director\nJuly 17, 1961\nDear Bill,\nThanks very much for your card....I hope you\nhave a good time Mon the road;\" ITm sure you*11\nenjoy getting back on home grounds again in\nMadison.\nI»m enclosing a copy of the article I just\ncompleted for the NAEB special magazine due for\npublication this fall. Also thought you*d be\ninterested in the suggestions I made to Bromo\nfor possible activities of the public relations\ncommittee. (He asked for ideas^ince 1 missed the\nmeeting of the committee in Columbus last spring.)\nYou would have enjoyed my assignment this\nweek-end. I judged a beauty contest to pick a\n\"Miss Lincoln Park\" as part of the Lincoln Park\nPageant held last week. I rather enjoyed it and\nnoticed I was much more speedy in making up my\nmind on the various categories than the male judge\nI«m not sure what that proves!\nSincerely,\nMarion Corwell"
