But a similar\nnon-committal, ironic whimsicality will appear more and more, not only in\nT.V. figures, but will evoke many persons and forms of expression, not\ndirectly related to T.V. The newspaper man and reader are just as baffled\nby these changes emanating from T.V. depth suggestion as the bookman. Yet\na century ago, the poets and painters began to unfold in detail this whole\ncomplicated story which has now become part of the educational drama.\nThe square and the egghead are the bookmen as seen by the new T.V.\ngeneration. In the sixteenth century, the new book generation saw the\noral and oracular previous generation much as Polonius appeared to Ham¬\nlet. The razor precision of the oral schoolmen appeared to the new\nliterary humanists as \"words words words.\" They called the schoolmen\nnot squares, but dunces.\nThe new criticism (or reading in depth) which has appeared in\nour electronic era is often called scholastic in form by the literary\nhumanists. Is it not terribly wasteful of values and opportunities, as\nwell as destructive of harmony that unwittingly men should so embroil\nthemselves in civil feuds arising from media change? In our age the\nonset of multiple media changes makes impossible the older patterns\nof gradual adjustment and oblivion of the absolete. There is no time\nto adjust. We simply have to know, and understand, exactly what is\nhappening; and indeed, aS educators we can avail ourselves of the\nartists to help us to become contemporaries of ourselves. Rather we\nmust all become creative artists in order to cope with even the ban¬\nalities of daily life.\nJan. 19/60.\nMarshall McLuhan."
