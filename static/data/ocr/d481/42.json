The Center should not want, in any way,\nto Mmit the areas of activity which NAEB should be undertaking.\nWe must recognize there are many areas of common interest — as there\nare between NBC and NAB, for example; and that both our organizations\nwill be active, separately and together, in many matters. If at a\nstaff level, we can honestly respect the sincerity and ability of each\nother; and operate with a desire to help the other and keep him\ninformed of those of our activities in which we know he will be\ninterested, I see no reason why a most harmonious relationship cannot\nbe established and continued without each trying to limit the other\nby a set of ,#wri tings\" .\nExcuse the long sentences, but this is the way it came outJ"
