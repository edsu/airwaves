Not inspirational* I should say* but quietly persuasive*\nThis sort of thing was not done overnight* I understand it took more than a\nyear to prepare* It was produced for the National Association of Educational Broad¬\ncasters with funds provided by the Ford Foundation*\nThis series* produced with a generous budget and freedom from commercial pres¬\nsures* is a fine exasple of what can be accomplished in radio as combined high-grade\nentertainment and education*"
