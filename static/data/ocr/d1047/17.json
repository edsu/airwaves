C.\nDear Bills\nI recently received a letter from Robert L. Davy who is now\nwith Welton Becket and Associates who are architects and\nengineers in San Francisco. I met Davy briefly at the convention\nand I went into a complete blank. Although he looks familiar and\nX know I have been associated with him at sometime, I cannot\nrecreate our association. He is applying for a $ob here and lists\nWHA as one of his first duties in his experience record (1947-\n4S on WHA).\nHe says now that he has decided \"That educational broadcasting is\nthe place where I can excell and work creatively and satisfyingly\nthe rest of my professional life.\" What can you tell me about the\nguy?\nSincerely,\nRichard B.
