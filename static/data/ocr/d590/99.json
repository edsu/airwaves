  "text": "realities of educational financing are to be faced. Therefore these two\nelectronic madia* with suoh related potential developments as facsimile,\nmultiplexing and stereophonic broadcasting, are approached together, rather\nthan separately, in isolation, or unrelated to all the other materials of\ninstruction which are available.\nIn this connection, maximum use of television and radio for\neducation requires the maximum possible knowledge of films and all other\naudio and visual aids, as well as of the learning theories involved In the\nuses of any \"tools11 for teaching. The utmost cooperation with all other\norganizations would be requisite to the approach to be taken in the developÂ¬\nment of teacher-training courses, particularly, in this field.\nSecondly, virtually all the instructors of courses which\ncurrently attempt to teach the uses of these media seem oblivious to the\nbasic differences in the effects of the media, regardless of content*\nThe approach visualized by the MSB is best described in the article by Dr.\nMarshall McLuhan in the December issue of the MSB Journal attached herewith.\nA clear understanding of the basic nature of the electronic media^ so different\nin their effects and potentials from the printed media or even the film, is\nthe foundation which must precede \"techniques\" instruction, if these courses\nare not to become merely orientation in the use of gadgets.\nTo presume to describe the peculiarities of the electronic media\nin depth in this document would be impractical. It is hoped that the approach\neu\noutlined in the article of Dr. McLuhan, who would serve as ^consultant to this\nproject, may suggest the directions in which we feel any courses in the\nuses of the electronic media must be guided if maximum value from, their use\nis to be realised."
