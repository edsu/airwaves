Signed and mailed May 11, 1961\nMichigan educators, who have been involved in educational television\nfor the last decade, heartily endorse the concepts underlying the proposed\nFederal ET¥ legislation. As Governor of this State, I concur with the\nopinions of these forward-looking educators representing public and\nprivate colleges, universities, and school systems in both peninsulas of\nMichigan.\nLast; year, in anticipation of Federal ET¥ support, the Superintendent\nof Public Instruction and his Working (kwmittee on El? composed of educators\nand representatives of labor, industry, and civic groups, sought and received\nfoundation funds to conduct a comprehensive study of ETV7 uses in Michigan.\nPhis state-wide study, which began in September of 1960, will develop\na plan to centralize and coordinate further ETV development and to\nstrengthen the many present organizations involved in ETV. The high level\ncooperative pattern of development which has led Michigan to its position\nof leadership in educational uses of television was a cooperative system\nwhi:h involved state, regional, and local levels of education. This pattern\nwill continue under the leadership of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.\nAs you know, Michigan has been a pioneer in EF? and we welcome Federal\nfunds to help accelerate our use of this educational tool and assist\neducators in the other 49 states to develop meaningful programs of their\nown. As all 50 states move forward and share experiences which this seed\nprogram will initiate, education in America will develop more rapidly\nand with batter quality than in any country in the world."
