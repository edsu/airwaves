Nevertheless 1 would not rush ahead until\nafter we have had a January meeting. There are certain aspects\nwhich require discussion and while 1 do not see them as being\ninsurmountable there can be no harm awaiting a full fledged talk\namong members of the board.\nWith all best wishes, believe me.\nCordially yours*\nSeymour N. Siegfcl\nDirector\nsns /be\ncc: Ausmus* Achooley"
