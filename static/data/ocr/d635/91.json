This must be a committee project.\nA few other miscellaneous things that occurred:\n1. The Board was of the opinion that someone should attempt\nto get auplantn on the TV in one of the major\nnational publications. The Board asked me to write you to see\nif you can do anything about this. Fletcher also was of the\nopinion that this needed to be done. Can it be arranged for\nReader’s Digest to pick up a story from some other magazine?\n2. The Board approved Smythe’s request for about\nfor various research projects and presumably Smythe dtd get\nin touch with the Committee of Five prior to a. letter'$going\nout to the Foundation requesting funds for next year. I assume\nthis was done inasmuch as the letter from the Committee under\nthe date of April 25 carries a request for slightly over a\nhundred thousand dollars for research.\nI have read Probst’s letter of April 25 for the ad hoc\ncommittee concerning ’’educational television programs, inc.”\nand commend you and the committee on it. As indicated above,\nI am dubious of the extent to which we can control or influence\nthis or any other Foundation project but at least this letter\nindicates that you# boys are trying.\nChairman Walker was practically in tears over the presen¬\ntation of the life membership certificate. Again my hat is\noff to you for conceiving the idea. It was indeed a masterful\nstroke.\nThere were a number of other little things which may\ninterest you but perhaps we’ll have an opportunity to discuss\nthem in detail at the Michigan meeting.\nrice«:\nRasmus\nisident"
