C. I\nappear on behalf of The National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters, popularly known as the NAEB. The NAEB is an\nassociation composed primarly of universities and colleges\noperating radio broadcasting stations, either standard, FM\nor television. These stations are all operated on a non¬\nprofit or non-commercial educational basis. At the present\ntime, its membership includes licensees of over 150 radio and\ntelevision stations or those holding construction permits for\nsuch stations and the Association has more than 500 additional\nindividual and associated members. The Association has\nappeared and presented its views to the Congress in the past\non matters which might affect educational broadcasting and\nthe interests of its members.\nMy purpose in appearing before you is not to urge either\nthe adoption or rejection of the basic objectives of S.2834,\nbut to point out that under the language as it is presently\ndrafted, the bill, if it is adopted, would have a serious\nand, I am sure, unintended adverse effect on the operation of\nnon-profit and non-commercial educational broadcasting stations\nconducted by educational institutions which are members of\nthe Association"
