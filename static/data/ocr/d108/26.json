All it requires is a certificate\non the part of the Receiving Station that the material is News.\"\nIf the NAEB can*t be called a \"Receiving Station,\" perhaps arrangeÂ¬\nments can be made to channel tapes through a station* Anyway, it's\none more bit of information I thought you should have if you didn't\nalready*\nOh, yes, and Sy says he looks forward to hearing further from you.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nW.,\nJHtcr\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager"
