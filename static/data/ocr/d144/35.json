C.\nJune 19, 1963\nMr. Louie Baneguy\nDirector, Coordination end Information\nAlabama Educational Television Cocsnission\n2131 Highland Avenue\nBirmingham 5, Alabama\nDear Lou;\nThanks for your letter of June 10, and your willingness to help\nout with the convention program.\nX realise that a session on general public relations would probably\nbe helpful to a great many people. I feel that, if we have one, it\nshould deal with both radio and TV and should be designed to help\nthose who don't really know Mich About PR at the station level, in\norder to help them promote their own activities and those of the\nHA32B, as well as educational broadcasting in general.\nIf v were to follow the general format for the special interest\nsessions, we would probably have a formal paper on radio and one\non TV at the session, but with each of them geared so as to be\nhelpful to all.\nAt the time X met with Jack McBride, chairman of our national convenÂ¬\ntion planning committee, we did not include in our preliminary plans\na session on H*. We didn't include a lot of other things we'd like\nto have in, either, simply because we don't have enough time to squeeze\nin all we'd like to have.\nHowever, the plans are still in the formative stage and it is possible\nthat we will include something on PR. ws probably won't be able to make\nfinal decisions for another month. If we do decide to include the PR\nsession. I'm delighted to know that we can call on you for assistance.\nwrn/mlM\nce: Mrs. Betty McKenzie\nMe*. Marion Corwell"
