The information in your letter, along with\nthe pamphlets, brochures and other information you sent Mill be\nof imense value to me in planning a ten-Matt FM operation. I\nrealize that the accumulation and organization of the information\nin your letter took a great deal of time and I am therefore doubly\nappreciative.\nIn your letter you listed ten 10-Matt stations in Illinois,\nIndiana, and Michigan. I have contacted and have received ansMers\nfrom directors of seven of the ten stations you suggested. The\ndirectors Mere very helpful in supplying information, schedules,\nbrochures, and encouragement. Everyone connected with educational\nradio seems sold on its value to a school system and a community.\nI have found it very easy to have this enthusiasm rub off on me^\nsince from the beginning I had been sure that a ten-Matt operation\nMould have particular value for my school system and my community.\nIn addition to its educational Mork to the students, faculty and\ncommunity. I feel that it Mould be a great public relations\ninstrument for the schools.\nAfter Me have progressed a little further in the development\nof an operation at Portage I am sure that Me Mould be interested\nin joining the NAEB, Your organization has been mentioned and\nhighly recommended by the directors Mho have Mritten me.\nThank you again for your fine letter and materials.
