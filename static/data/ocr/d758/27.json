I should lilce to initiate system which will provide for\nmore editorial judgment on JOURNAL contents, if you'll ag.-ee am help,\ntoo.\nMy idea is to get reaction of committee members on articles\nsubmitted for publication. This procedure will be used wher* time\npermits. It would be by-passed where time is of the essence. I8d\ncheck articles with one or two committee members.

I have asked Burton 'au.u\nto write one on some aspect of use of radio in Europe, or some spct\nin Europe. We have an article that Tracy Tyler solicited from\nHarold Engel on the oldest station.\n5. We need good pictures badly. We often come up to press\ntime without really good pictures. Pictures with article are always\nhelpful.\n6.
