As\ninterpreted by our courts, these clauses provide an effective\nguarantee that governmental regulation shall not abridge free,\nindividual expression.\nThird: — In the contemporary situation with mass com¬\nmunication concentrated to a considerable extent in each local¬\nity, and in the nation, in a relatively small number of relatively\nlarge units, protection against government is not enough to\nguarantee that a man who has something to say shall have a\nchance to say it.

The need is so essential to a demo¬\ncratic process that it acquires the stature of a citizen’s right and\nfor the agencies of mass communication an obligation which\nthey must reasonably meet as the price of their freedom. A\nfree press and radio and film industry, therefore, must be a\nresponsible or accountable press, radio, and film industry.\nFifth: — This responsibility on the part of the major\nmedia of mass communication means that they “should regard"
