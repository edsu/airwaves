Iowa has been\ncalled a key state in the educational television\nnetwork that will probably be created if your\ncommittee gives favorable action to the\nEducational Television Bill.\nThe legislature of my state has\npassed a concurrent resolution that I believe\nis even added authority to my endorsement\nof the State of Iowa’s determination to carry\nforth an educational television program. I\nam inclosing a copy of the Concurrent Resolu¬\ntion No. 15, passed by the House on April 25th\nand by the Senate on April 28th.\nI send you my personal regards.\nSincerely yours,\nNorman A. Erbe\nGovernor\nRepresentative Oren Harris\nHouse Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee\nNew House Office Building\nWashington, D.C."
