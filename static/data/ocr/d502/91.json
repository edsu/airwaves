NAEB\nUniversity of Illinois\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Ill.\nMai' 3 1354\n[7)?l?lW,l|12|l|2|8|4|5|P\nMy dear Harry:\nHow about Consultant on Community Affairs, or\nCommunity Consultant? That I think, fits in\nbetter; or. Management and Community Affairs\nConsultant. I think the injection of community\nis better than Management Personnel - or labor\nor management. That certainly would be easier for\nsome of your people to swallow, and it certainly\nfits in better in my general public service 6#\nconsultant work.\nRe the meeting idea: I did not give it any more\nthought because I was waiting for some official\nword that I was getting from Graydon, He called\nme one day the early part of last week to dis¬\ncuss some of the financial arrangements which he\nsaid was needed for a memorandum he was preparing,\nand said that he would get official word to me.\nThat's why I held up answering your April 20th\ndittoed memo. As a matter of fact, I was going to\nwrite to you about it today.\nAs to the Chicago meeting it seems to me that a\ngood time might be the week-end of May 22nd, at the\nHotel Stevens or some other hotel ih Chicago. Maybe,\nactually Saturday the 22nd or Sunday the 23d. Some\nof the people might be coining to the NARTB meetings,\nor the Engineering Conference. Does that make sense?\nMSN:m\nSincerely yours"
