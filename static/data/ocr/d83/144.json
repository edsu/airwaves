  "text": "Notice that high definition image has a completely\ndifferent pattern of completion from low definition image.\nIt is the difference between suggestion and statement. The\nlow definition involves the perceiver in high participation,\nwhether in poetry, painting, or problem solving. An audi¬\nence accustomed to high participation because of low defini¬\ntion imagery will tend strongly toward do-it-yourselfness and\ncreativity. I have said enough about television to suggest\nwhy its deeply introverted mode accidentally and unexpectedly\nfavours the book. Its tactual stress favours the pocket\nbook as well as the small car, and all the new textural values\nof interior decoration, packaging and design. If you can\nprovide me with a single discordant note in this analysis it\nwill help me to see more deeply into the problem.\nI see no reason why we cannot now move the whole enter¬\nprise of media study in the direction of electrical Systems\nDevelopment, helping us toward a higher degree of prediction\nand control of our cultural environment at all levels—verbal\nand non-verbal.\nA propos of accelerated change; whereas adjustment is\nimpossible, understanding and control are not impossible. In\nfact, it is onlyfplanned accelerated change that you are in\ncharge of change at all* But such change implies not just\nthe initiating of a single factor, but the anticipation of all\nits consequences. You become the change in order to control\nit.\nCordially"
