The language problem was brought to\nthe fore but it was felt that this was not a great obstacle.\nIt was agreed that each member country should provide as far as pos¬\nsible brief papers on the subjects brought up for discussion to enable\nmore comprehensive and useful dissemination of information. For this\npurpose it was found necessary to seek to increase the duration of\nfuture conferences.\nIt was strongly felt that a concrete recommendation be made to each\nmember country to include at least one engineering representative at\nall future conferences.\n20"
