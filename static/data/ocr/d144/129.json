Corwell\nAssociate Dir. of School Relations\nOffice of School Relations\nDearborn Public Schools\n5757 Neckel\nDearborn, Michigan\nDear Miss Corwell: ' ^-4 ' ' Â£ h.\nThe next Newsletter will contain a list of NAEB Committees, and I wanted\nto let you know why the Public Relations Committee is no longer listed.\nThere is no doubt that the NAEB needs a well developed PR program, but\nthis should really be a staff function. I believe you will agree that\na sound Public Relations program cannot be conducted by a committee. If\ncertain specific matters seem to need committee advice and assistance\n(e.g. the present work being done by you and Lee Campion on a speakers\nguide), either ad hoc committees or one or two individuals will be asked\nto help out.\nI appreciate the very real service this committee has provided in the\nface of extreme administrative difficulties, and you may be sure that\nI will call upon you again.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley\nHEH:kk"
