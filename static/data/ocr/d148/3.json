  "text": "We Review\nAdult Educations The Community Ap¬\nproach, by Paul H. Sheats, Clarence D.\nJayne, Ralph B. Spence. The Dryden\nPress, N.Y. 530 pages, 1953.\nAn exceptionally able discussion of\nadult education in the United States pre¬\nsented in a lively awareness of the com¬\nplexity of the problem. The liberal\nuse of long and short quotations from\ndefinitive sources linked together with\ndiscerning commentary and systematic\nanalysis makes exciting reading. While\nthe authors have a bias in favor of the\nthesis that adult education must focus\nin the local community with the aim of\nimproving “citizen participation in de¬\ncision making”, they recognize the im¬\nportance of other points of view, par¬\nticularly the sociological factors that\nmake the local primary groups help¬\nless in a world of growing interdepend¬\nence, of overwhelming increase in\nknowledge, and of accelerating change.\nExtension workers will be intrigued\nby the fact that this book is the first\nof the “new” adult education movement\nto give adequate recognition to Univer¬\nsity Extension and to the role of the\nAmerican university as a unique resource\nin adult education. The discussion of\nUNESCO is fair but other international\nprograms are slighted.\nThe book closes with quotations from\nMalcolm MacLean: “We must stop dead\nin their tracks all attempts to throttle\nthe enlightment of our children and\nourselves; we must view efforts ... to\nrestrict or prohibit discussion of con¬\ntroversial issues ... as especially per¬\nilous.” The authors concluded: Our\ninsistence on the importance of educa¬\ntion is strong not because of any assur¬\nance of its readiness to do the job but\nbecause there is no alternative. The\nfaith that sustains us is the faith in\nthe democratic way.” W.S.B.\nMoral and Spiritual Education in\nHome, School, Community. A program\naid for your P.T.A. Nat.

The content of the magazine is\ndivided into two parts.\nPart I, which is designed to provide\nsecondary-school principals with essen¬\ntial information about supervised corre¬\nspondence study, contains three chap¬\nters. Chapter 1, “Can We Really Teach\nWell by Correspondence?” presents evi¬\ndence gained from research, from ex¬\nperience, and from observation. Chap¬\nter 2 explains the purposes of super¬\nvised correspondence study as an in¬\ntegral part of the high school program,\nas a means of education for adults and\nout-of-school youth, as a way of pro¬\nviding education to homebound and iso¬\nlated pupils, and as an instrument of\ncurriculum improvement. Chapter 3 ex¬\nplains the operation of the system in\nthe local school and in the correspond¬\nence study center, and indicates the\nrole of State agencies.\nPart II provides specialized informa¬\ntion concerning programs conducted in\nforeign countries, about the therapeu¬\ntic uses of correspondence study, and\nabout the programs in correctional in¬\nstitutions.\nThe magazine as a whole provides\nthe most complete single treatment of\ncorrespondence study at the secondary\nschool level which has yet appeared.\nG. B. Childs.\nWorld Affairs\nThe Newsletter of the N.U.E.A. Com¬\nmittee on World Affairs, issued by Wil¬\nliam C. Rogers, Chairman, (University\nof Minnesota) contains brief descrip¬\ntions of extension activities in this sub¬\nject matter area of thirty-one univer¬\nsities and colleges.\nThe group at the sectional meeting\nat the East Lansing convention dis¬\ncussed plans for expanding the work\nof the committee. It was decided that\nthe Newsletter should be continued. A\nresolution was recommended to the Ex¬\necutive Committee of the N.U.E.A. urg¬\ning the development of a cooperative\nproject coordinating experiments.\nPaul Sheats\nThere is a lot of newly found inter¬\nest in adult education in the European\ncountries, but with relatively little un¬\nderstanding of progress in the funda¬\nmental education field (literacy) as it\nhas developed in the United States.\nThis is the conclusion reached by\nDr. Paul Sheats, who has returned to\nhis U.C.L.A. post as associate director\nof University of California Extension\nafter nearly a year spent in visiting\nItaly, Spain, France, and Switzerland.\nThe latter country is the most ad¬\nvanced in its methods of adult educa¬\ntion, according to Dr. Sheats. Educa¬\ntion for the underprivileged is every¬\nwhere a crying need, with some prog¬\nress notable, especially in Italy in the\nfield of technical, industrial, and agri¬\ncultural education.\n“It is important from our point of\nview that there be ever increasing a-\ndult education facilities developed in\nEuropean countries, especially in Italy,\nwhere the communist threat is great,\nbut the answer lies in indigenous de¬\nvelopment combined with our practi¬\ncal aid. In Italy, with the lack of\ncommunication facilities some fine work\nis being done by individuals in remote\nsections of the country.”\nDuring the first weeks of his stay\nabroad, Dr. Sheats completed chapters\nas co-author of the volume on “Adult\nEducation” (see elsewhere in this Bul¬\nletin) which was published in New York\non the eve of his return to this country.\nHe was accompanied on the motor trip\nof some 7000 miles to four countries by\nMrs. Sheats and their four children.\nTV\nRalph Steetle, Executive Director of\nthe Joint Committee on Educational\nTelevision, reports that, on June 4, 47 ap¬\nplications had been filed for educational\ntelevision channels (20% of the total\nnumber reserved for educational use)\nand 17 construction permits have been\ngranted. One educational station,\nKUHT, Houston, Texas, is already on\nthe air, in addition to WOI-TV of Iowa\nState College, and several others are\nexpected to begin operation soon.\nThe great majority of applications filed\nfor educational channels, according to\nSteetle, ‘“show solid financial and com¬\nmunity support.” Many applications\ndescribe generous offers of assistance\nby commercial interests. In Birming¬\nham, Alabama, for instance, Storer\nBroadcasting Company has offered to\nprovide a complete transmitter and an¬\ntenna. Other applicants report offers\nof other types of equipment and cash\ndonations."
