  "text": "TO: MEMBERS OP THE IN-SCHOOL COMMITTEE.\nDear Miss P. and Gentlemen:\nAssume that the attached memorandum is self-explanatory and\nsatisfactory* If you have any suggestions on further communications, or\nactions that should be done, prior to the Columbus meeting let me know\nand we will do our best.\nMay I be so bold as to suggest that you, the committee, not\ndepend entirely on this notice. lou know the school stations and the\npeople involved far better than I, so if you think of someone who might\nhave some good series available vhy not do a little personal prodding by\nmail? Our experience thus far indicates much enthusiasm for these ideas,\nespecially at meetings, but when people get back to the daily grind of\nthe job they gradually lose this enthusiasm. I think it is only natural\nthat this should be the case, but—we still want sane cracking good\nschool programs. Perhaps a prod here and there from committee members\nindividually would do far more good than a general dittoed memo. It is\npossible, also, that if we get enough programs submitted you can begin\nto think about next year as well as the current need*\n*• -\nIn any event we stand ready to do all we can. Let us have\nall suggestions.\nWarmest regards.\nDick Rider"
