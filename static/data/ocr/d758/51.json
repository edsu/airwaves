Tyler, Editor\nThe NAEB Journal\nThe National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Tyler:\nWe have read with interest your editorial in the November 1960 issue of The NAEB\nJournal entitled \"The Limitations of Teaching Machines. 1 We are in firm agree¬\nment with you that the era of the teaching machine should be viewed by the class¬\nroom teacher as a time when the new tools will permit him to be a better and more\neffective teacher by relieving him of tedious routine drill work. However, we are\ndisturbed by your paragraph that reads in part, \"Perhaps some teachers have heard\nextravagant claims as to what the teaching machines can do. This is not surprising.\nThe equipment salesman is anxious to make a sale. \"\nWe believe that this statement is not quite factual. Responsible elements in the\nelectronic industry have been steadfast in their insistence that proper programming\nmust come first before we, the manufacturers, can even attempt to build the \"hard¬\nware\" for a teaching machine. We have continually worked in the closest way with\neducators to develop materials simultaneously with equipment in order that tax¬\npayer's money might be wisely invested in good educational tools and materials,\nrather than foolishly spent on novelties and electronic gadgetry. We regretfully\nadmit that there are some individuals making extravagant claims but we hasten to\nreassure you that they are not speaking for the firms whose interests are in serving\nthe school market now and in the years to come.\nSincerely yours,\nLloyd E.
