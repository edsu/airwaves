NOVIK\nJune f>.\nDear Graydon; \\ OjM\nDear Harry;\nI thought you would want to know about this.\nWhen I was in Chicago last week I received a call\nfrom Mr. Sherer. It seems Judith Waller and Duffy\nSwartz had told him I was in town. Would I find\nthe time to come to see him and Mr. Ryerson. President\nof Inland Steel, re Channel 11.\nI told them right off the bat that I was\ncommitted and wasn't interested in the job. However,\nit seems they called to discuss with me the community\nparticipation and unions. I told them I would be\nwilling to rearrange a Milwaukee trip and come back\nlate Friday afternoon if that was satisfactory.\nEvidently it didn't scare them because they waited.\nWe had a very good session. They knew a little\nabout NAEB. They were thankful for the suggestions,\netc., etc.\nThey have raised about $800,000 from top\nbusiness groups but haven't done anything to get\ntheir community funds.\nAs a \"roving ambassador\" my report is;\nVisit—satisfactory and pleasant) Results—unknown;\nAccomplishments—I think they know a little bit\nmore of the needs for community participation on\nthe Advisory Committee level.\nThey asked for suggestions andythe few names\nI could think of evidently hit the spbt. j"
