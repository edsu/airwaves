Locally, research personnel connected with edu¬\ncational radio and television stations and production agencies\nface frustrating problems resulting from significant and\ncomplex needs on the one hand, and inadequate financial and\nhuman resources on the other.”\nAt its Annual Convention, the NAEB heard the appeal of UNESCO\nfor it to serve as a central coordinating body in the educational\ntelevision and radio research areas. The educational systems\nas well as the broadcasters of Prance, England and various other\nnations have similarly urged the need for as full an interchange\nof materials on educational uses of these media as possible.\nEducation must engage in at least as much such research as industry\nfinds indispensable if educational funds are to be well spent\nand educational values preserved. Following the various requests\nmentioned, the NAEB Research Seminar, through the NAEB Research\nCommittee, called upon the NAEB to set up a Department of Research,\nheaded by a qualified Research Coordinator. This request is\nresponsive to that need*\nThis Research Department will coordinate and consolidate the\nresults and significance to education of all studies in closed\nand open circuit TV and radio; in credit, enrichment, and general\nadult education; in impact and effectiveness in the broadcast\ndiscussion, public affairs and instructional areas rather than\nmerely nn audience size; in utilisation as well as in production;\nin specific techniques and formats as well as in general uses;"
