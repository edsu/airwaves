I am certain that a majority of the\nMembers of Congress share my sentiments in this regard.\nYour suggestion that radio be given equal recog¬\nnition in the title of any new law establishing public financial\nsupport for educational broadcasting is a good one and I have\ncalled your views on this subject to the attention of Chairman\nHarley Staggers of the House Commerce Committee. A copy of\nthe letter to Congressman Staggers is enclosed.\nOnce again, let me thank you for contacting me con¬\ncerning this matter.\nSincerely.\nDBFsFsm\nEnclosure"
