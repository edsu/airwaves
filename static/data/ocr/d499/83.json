  "text": "- 3 -\nAs you will have gathered from the early part of this letter, if your application\nwere made fairly soon it could be referred to our members for a postal vote,\nthus enabling NAEB to be represented at our second General Assembly which is to\nbe held in 'Tokyo from 21st to 29th October next. This will be a vary important\nmeeting in Ifche history of the ABU: much time at our first General Assembly was\nnecessarily devoted to preliminary planning but we now have an operative, if\nvery young, Union. I feel sure that NAEB representation - particularly you\nyourself - would be warmly welcomed by our existing members. In addition\nto being important it will of course also be a pleasant occasion because, as\nyou already lonow well, NHK are warm and generous hosts.\nI am afraid this is a long letter although I have tried to deal only with major\npoints but if there is any other information you need I hope you will not\nhesitate to 1-et me know.\nWith kind regards,\nYours sincerely,\nCHARLES MOSES\nSecretary-General\nMr. W.G. Harley,\nPresident,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\n1346 Connecticut Avenue,\nWASHINGTON 36, D.C.\nU.S.A."
