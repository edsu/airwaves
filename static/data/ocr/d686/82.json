  "text": "May 2k, 1951\nMr* eymour Siegel\nPresident\nPASS\nHew York City, Hew York\nDear Bit\nI want to follow up on your suggestion that I forward a\ncopy of the tentative program for the fell meeting to every person\nwho was registered at the Institute in Columbus. These should\ngo out on NAKB stationery and in HAEB envelopes. My supply of\nboth is a bit low. Would you please forward to me as soon as\npossible about 1,000 envelopes and 1,000 sheets of HAS® letter¬\nhead. I will mimeograph the program on plain white paper*\nMy operational budget for the year is in the red——with\nfour months more to go so I would like MAEB to provide me with\nstamps for this big mailing job. There were about 800 people\nin attendance at the Ohio Institute. In addition to the above\nmailing, I shall get letters out to every NASB member station\nasking for a complete station directory. That will take about\n100 stamps more-a total of about 900 3£ stamps. This will\nmsfcn about ?27.00 worth of stamps which I ordinarily could absorb\nfrom my own budget but, as I said above, my budget for the year\nis already in the red and I am behind the eight ball with my\nUniversity without asking for that much money for stamps. If\nyou could arrange for Mr. Griffith to send me the stamps right\naway, I should appreciate it.\nI realise that I can’t get these stamps and supplies in\nhere before I leave but I will dictate all the necessary letters,\nand have everything ready for my secretary to mail out as soon as\nthese supplies and stamps come in. She will continue to build\nour complete station directory and will continue to work with\nHr* Griffith and the regional directors on new membership drive\nwhile I am in school. I should appreciate your moving these two\nrequests along as soon as possible so we can get these two big\nprojects under way immediately.\nMy best to you.\nSincerely,\nGraydon Ausraus\nVice-President\nGA/ns"
