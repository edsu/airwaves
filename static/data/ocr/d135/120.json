RAY\nLast year the Instructional Film\nResearch Program at Pennsylvania\nState University published a report on\nthe use of closed-circuit television in\nuniversity teaching. This article pre¬\nsents further results of the study,\ncovering the second year of exper¬\nimentation. L. P. Greenhill is re¬\nsearch associate in the Department of\nPsychology and associate director of\nthe Instructional Research Program\nat The Pennsylvania State University.\nC. R.

To determine whether or not good classroom instruction\ncan be extended effectively to large numbers of university students\nby the use of closed-circuit television.\n2. To attempt to improve the general quality of university\nteaching through the use of television both as a mode for present¬\ning instruction and as a means for observing and studying instruc¬\ntion-learning processes.\nIn approaching these problems four research areas have been\noutlined. These may be summarized by four concepts: effective¬\nness, appropriateness, feasibility, and acceptability.\nEffectiveness is a matter of primary importance. It relates to\nthe relative effects on students’ achievement of instruction pre¬\nsented by various methods with and without television.
