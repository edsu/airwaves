C.\nSince the nation's capital is the prime area of\nnews and public affairs program material, the\nPublic Affairs Bureau must be in Washington, D. C.\nWhen live network radio is initiated for edu¬\ncational stations, a key origination point will\nbe Washington, D. C. The establishment of the\ntape network is the first step in a logical\nsequence of expansion events envisioned for public\nradio.\nSummary\nOn the basis of efficiency, unity of effort, im¬\nproved distribution, creation of production facilities\nand future expansion and growth of public radio, the\nrelocation of NERN from Urbana to Washington, D. C.\nis justifiable.\nProposed Schedule\nIt is proposed that the physical move be accomplished in late\nJune and early July, 1969. This time frame was selected for\na variety of reasons. The network begins its new fiscal year\non July 1. Realistic cost accounting would result from a\ntotal year's operation in a single location. The production\nschedule of network programming is at its lowest ebb during\nJune, July and August. The present network manager has re¬\nsigned effective June 30, 1969. The phasing of new personnel\nwith the relocation is desirable. (Note: Personnel employed\nat Urbana will not relocate to Washington, D. C.)\nTo avoid a time lag in the duplicating and distribution pro¬\ncess, (which would increase the costs) the move would be made\nin a single phase.\nJune 1 New tape network manager reports to\nUrbana for orientation. Production\nschedule increased to allow for down\ntime during move."
