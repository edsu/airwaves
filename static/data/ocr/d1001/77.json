The Planning\nSubcommittee consisted of Kenneth Wright [WUOT] Bernard Buck [WNYC]\nand Lee Eitzen [WSUI]*\nACCEPTANCE SUBCOMMITTEE\nThe new Acceptance Subcommittee, as reported by Chairman\nJohn Regnell, took over with a back log of eleven series which had not\nbeen voted upon. Since then forty-nine series and single shot programs\nhave been referred to the committee making a total of 60 programs and\nseries. Of these thirty-one have been approved for distribution,\nfifteen have not received approval, and as of October 7th fourteen\nhave not been voted upon. The network has enough approved program\nmaterial to operate until July 1956 and possibly into the summer season.\nAuditing of submitted programs and determining their acceptability has\nprogressed satisfactorily, and slow-downs have occurred only when great\nnumbers of audition tapes are distributed at a time to committee members\nIt has been the policy of the committee to compromise as little as\npossible on production and talent quality. It is information that we\nare concerned with, but its effectiveness can be diminished by mediocre\npresentation."
