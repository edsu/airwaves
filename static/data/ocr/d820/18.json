Direct addition\nof the audio outputs of each receiver can\nbe obtained in lieu of diode-gate selection\nwhen the diode-audio switch is in the\naudio position.\nThe AVC voltages in the receiver\nchannels are applied to vacuum-tube\nvoltmeters, shown in Fig. 7 as Ml, M2,\nand M3, to provide indications of signal\nstrengths. VTVM M4 is furnished to\nindicate logarithmically the combined\nsignal strength. Audio signal level in\nany channel can be measured by means\nof VU meter incorporated in the com¬\nbiner but not shown in the diagram.\nConclusion: By means of the push¬\nbutton switching unit, which contains\nthe common-load resistors and dummy¬\nload resistors, any receiver channel can\nbe connected individually to its dummy\nload to feed any of the three audio line\namplifiers; alternatively, signals from any\ncombination of two or three receivers\nconnected in a diversity arrangement on\na common load can be fed to any one of\nthe audio amplifiers. This provides full\nflexibility of interconnection between the\nvarious receiver channels and the three\naudio amplifiers, so that they can be set\nup in any conceivable arrangement of\ntriple-diversity, dual-diversity, or single¬\nreceiver systems with a choice of either\nsideband from any receiver or combina¬\ntion of receivers. Such flexibility ensures\ndependable operation under virtually any\ncombination of operating requirements\nFIG. 9. POWER SUPPLIES FOR THREE ADAPTORS\nand atmospheric conditions. Fig. 8\nshows a complete triple-diversity equip¬\nment rack: the diversity combiner occu¬\npies the top space; under it are three\ngroups of adaptors and receivers; finally,\nat the bottom, a power supply panel\nfurnishes power for the adaptors. A rear\nview of this panel is given in Fig. 9.\nEQUUIPMENT UNDER R.C.A.
