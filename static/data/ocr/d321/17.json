You have so many duties\nthat you would be ex-officio but not active members of the\ncommittee. On matters of policy I think that you should\nbe consulted.\nI hope that funds will be available for additional meetings\nduring the year at Urbana instead of having just the two\nmeetings that we presently have, one at the National Convention\nand the other at the Columbus Institute. I think that we\nshould have at least a quarterly meeting of the committee\nand expenses be paid for committee members, because obviously\nthey cannot take the expenses of such travel out of their\nown University funds. I look forward to an early meeting\nof the Committee.\nI never can condense all that I want to say into a night\nletter by wire, consequently, this goes off by air-mail.\nCordially yours,\nWaldo Abbot\ndirector of Broadcasting\nWA:mv"
