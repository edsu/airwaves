Che interesting development was that the JGET has set a price of $4°®0 per\nset on extra sets of material,\n5* The MSB. I outlined the various functions of the KAEB in the\npublication® area and explained oar rather modest mailing lists Vfe also wsra able,\nto compete successfully for the top honors fer else of staff £ot editorial £§fi@y\n1 believe sy summary of NA2B areas of responsibility 'ym@ adequate-: . ijhad previously\nmnt everyone represented copies of our publications, together with a jlist of\neverything m distributed with the newsletter, etc., so that there wodld be a®\nquestion of its area of operations. I expressed the hppe ^hat promotion of ETV\nviould not necessarily always assume that radio was a •fl&ad* duck® a® sens BHQBT\narticles seemed to indicate. In reply to the proposal.! of the HQOET that it\nhandle, all mv* releases for all organisations, I pointed out that the MEB\ntraditionally handled its own releases on publications and operations. Wa\ntherefore would be an exception to this relationship. |\nI wa invited by Bob to write a 1,000 word statement of the * interrela¬\ntionships of the media, and tbs possibility of the survival of radio, for their\nNewsletter o ' It was a rather shocking experience to fipd myself surrounded by\npeople idie believed that radio was now just the tail ojf the snake, which has been\ncut off but ®will scon stop wiggling,® as Bob Mullen so graphically put it.\nDeadlines for publications mm announced as, far a® possible.\nFor the HBGET, the first and fifteenth of each month, backing up\nfive or six days for submission of material.\nFor the «&2ET report®, the first of each month. Ifeeded five days\nin advance. Other material® throughout the month.\nThe MEB material needed by the 25th of each month.\nIn the final discussion, no satisfactory solution wap .found to the\nproblem of who sh@uldLj|s@lusively handle the large volume of sail reaching\nm 1 -da y 1 e MSI Uludents | a ta <k. g khese® and 1 things of a\nscholarly nature, and other random inquiries about where to find or secure various\nkinds of material, where to go to school to get good radio and television ©curses,\netc. Since no adequate solution to this could be found, the best we can do is for\neach organisation to provide each other with more carbon copies of its output."
