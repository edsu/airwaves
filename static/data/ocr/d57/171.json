These films are described in the attached\nbrochure. They are designed primarily for television usage and were\nproduced to build better citizenship by contributing to a better appre¬\nciation of the nature of our political and economic heritage.\nSince their release, these films have been acquired and used on various\neducational television stations and networks and have enjoyed secondary\nusage through having been adopted and obtained by various state depart¬\nments of education, colleges, universities and high schools for use in\neducation programs in the fields of social studies, civics, economics,\ncitizenship and American government.\nIndividually, these films are available for purchase at $60 each. The\nentire series of 13 films may be acquired for a total of $650. The\nfilms are 12^ minutes each in length and are black and white with sound.\nMany conferees who attended the Institute for Education by Radio and\nTelevision are requesting previews of these films and should you like\nto obtain them for review, we would be more than happy to make them\navailable for this purpose so that you might explore their possibili¬\nties of usefulness to your organization.\nGLENN A.
