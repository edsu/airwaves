Officials call him one of the ablest\nteachers in the school system.\nETV has also opened new paths of professional\nconsciousness for teachers. “Conversation about\nteaching techniques used to be almost taboo\namong teachers,” Platt says. “If someone asked\nabout the way you brought across a certain point\nin your class, it was a tacit admission of igno¬\nrance. Now ETV has made teaching a team re¬\nsponsibility, among the teacher on camera, his\ncounterparts in the classrooms, and their super¬\nvisors. ’ ’ ETV does not subordinate the role of the\nclassroom teacher; quite the opposite. Platt, who\nreturned to classroom teaching for two years and\nthen, in 1960, became a teacher in the Midwest\nProgram on Airborne Television, knows ETV\nfrom both sides of the screen. ‘ ‘ I spent more time\npreparing for the few minutes left to me as a\nclassroom teacher during a television class than\nI would for the forty-five minutes of a non-tele¬\nvision class. The better the television lesson, the\nmore the classroom teacher must be on his toes.\nHe spoon-feeds less. The televised portion of the\nlesson forces him to stimulate student questions\nand provoke reading and discussion. It is pegged\nto a norm, and the classroom teacher is challenged\nto identify and help students who are behind or\nahead of the norm. ETV lets you do this without\nholding up the rest of the class.”"
