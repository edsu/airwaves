  "text": "-7-\ncraze for methods and systems was the discovery of the en¬\nclosing power of single, fixed perspectives, applied to\nlaw and politics and economics, as well as to art and poetzy.\n4WH*\nHie simple fact is, as sense psychologists have shown, that\nthe awareness of fixed perspective or of vanishing points,\nis not a visual experience of which man is capable. The\nillusion of visual perspective is a mix of sensuous compon¬\nents, tactual and kinesthetic, hut to \"see” at a distance\nis a form of prediction, not of sensation. Thus what we\nsee is flat. What the cubists Painted as spatial form is\nfar closer to pure unaided visual experience than what\nWestern men have for centuries supposed to be visual experience *\n#**\nIt is worth dwelling on this matter, since it directly\nconcerns the powers of media to modify our sensuous lives\nwithout benefit of concepts or of indoctrination. Printing\nfostered visual perspective subliminally. Yet, already with\nthe Romantics, and their drive towards unconstrained spontaneity\nof vision and sensuous impression, the matrix of Gutenberg\nculture was dissolving. Hie Romantic vision moved steadily\ntowards cinematic illusion. And the achievement of the\ncinematic conveyor belt of still shots superseded the line\nof verbal-visual still shots that is printing. Hie photo\nsuperseded the print, and engraving, in the same way. Hie\nwords of William Ivins, Jr. (Prints and Visual Comainlcation -\nRout ledge and Kagan Paul, London, 1953) are of great relevance."
