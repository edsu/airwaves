Don*t appraise\nthe BBC on the basis of how it would go over in your community. The BBC\nis run by and for the British people; American broadcasting, by and for\nAmericans. Each system must be finally judged in terms of how well it\nserves its country, not on the basis of how it might work if it were located\nsomewhere else.\n21"
