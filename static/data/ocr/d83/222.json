The cause of Fascism, red and\nblack, and of teen-age peer group tribalism. Closed\nsocieties are of the ear, not of the eye *\nAll electronic forms tend strongly toward do-it-\nyourself involvement. The telegraph press makes the\nreader supply the meaning of the news.\nRadio makes the listener supply a visual world *\nCould the Orson Wells8 men from Mars have been done\nby newspaper?\nThe t.v. image is a sketchy mosaic which makes the\nviewer fill in the image himself«\nWhy do mechanical forms, like book and movie, tend\nto provide a complete consumer package, as compared\nwith electric forms?"
