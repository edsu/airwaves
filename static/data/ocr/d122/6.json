Harley\npresident-emeritus\nThe Services\nThe NAEB meets the professional\nneeds and interests of its members in\nboth general and specific ways. The\ngoal of all of its services is to promote\nand maintain a high quality of\nprofessionalism and to foster new\nideas by facilitating formal and infor¬\nmal professional communication.\nThe services of the NAEB are\norganized into four general areas: Pro¬\nfessional Training and Development,\nConferences and Conventions, Publi¬\ncations and Information, and Person¬\nnel Placement. Under each of these\ngeneral topics is a series of permanent,\non-going services designed to provide\nreal assistance to those who are\nseeking to develop their skills and\nknowledge, deepen their involvement\nand widen their impact.\nNAEB's Personnel and Employment\nService offers to its members the only\npersonnel placement service designed\nespecially for educational telecom¬\nmunications. The service is designed\nfor both those individuals seeking em¬\nployment, and those institutions seek¬\ning personnel. A newly-established\nclearinghouse for minorities and\nwomen is designed to aid institutions\nwishing to hire minority and women\ncandidates.\nThe NAEB publications office pro¬\nduces a monthly general NAEB Letter,\nthis annual national directory, numer¬\nous Professional Council letters, sever¬\nal special publications and mono¬\ngraphs, and the Public Telecomun-\nications Review, a widely acclaimed\nbi-monthly magazine. In addition to\nthe professional staff, editorial guid¬\nance and advice for the PTR is\nprovided by an editorial board.\nEditorial Advisory Board:\nSteve Millard\nChairperson\nLoveland, Colorado\nEva Archer\nNational Public Radio\nJoseph Aguayo\nChildren's Television Workshop\nDonna Allen\nPublisher, Media Report to Women\nFrederick Breitenfeld\nMaryland Center for Public Broadcasting\nDouglass Cater\nAspen Institute\nKaren Steffler Farr\nWNET-TV\nGeorge Hall\nVirginia Public Telecommunications\nCouncil\nSamuel C.

Among those events\nincluded in this area of service are: the\nConference on Instruction, the\nGraphics Design Workshop, a series of\nEducational Broadcasting Institute\nseminars and workshops, and the\nannual NAEB Convention, which is the\nlargest and most comprehensive\nprofessional gathering in its field. The\nschedule for the next three years is as\nfollows:\nNovember 13-17,1977 Washington, D.C.\nOctober 28-31, 1978 Washington, D.C.\nThe Special Activities\nIn addition to its regular program of\nservices, the NAEB realizes the impor¬\ntance of responding to special or\nimmediate needs as they arise. This\nmay mean moving to fill an informa¬\ntion gap—as with the development of\nthe Program Information Clearing¬\nhouse—or focusing attention on the\nprofessional opportunities for minori¬\nties and women by creating two\nstanding committees on Women's\nActivities and Minority Activities.\nThe Association also realizes that\noutstanding achievements in the field\ndeserves recognition and encourages\nimprovement. This recognition is\ngranted through the NAEB Distin¬\nguished Service Award, its Annual\nBook Award, and its various profes¬\nsional awards given by the Professional\nCouncils.\nBy remaining alert to trends in the\nfield, and flexible in staff capabilities,\nthe NAEB is able to create and\nmaintain a series of Special Activities.\n5"
