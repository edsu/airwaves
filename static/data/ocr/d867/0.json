C. 20036\nDear Dr. McMurrin:\nYour comments at the Western Radio-Television Assoc¬\niation meeting in Seattle on February 28 were interesting\nand informative.\nI was particularly pleased to hear you say that when\nthe results of the study by the Commission for Instruct¬\nional Technology are available for dissemination, a\nmulti-media approach will be used.\nWhen planning for this phase of the Commissions work,\nI hope you will include educational radio along with\nETV and the print media. Based on the information I\nreceive from personnel in educational radio stations\n(almost 400 of them across the country), interest in\nthe Commission report is high — not only among station\npersonnel but the general public as well.\nAs you know, the National Educational Radio Tape Net¬\nwork serves as the principal distributor of educational\nprogramming. One appropriate technique would be via\naudio tape to member stations. Production arrangements\ncan be accomplished with ease and the Commission report\nwould become available to the public through a variety\nof media.\nRex Campbell of KUED at the University of Utah can\nprovide additional information on NERN1s program service.\nWe look forward to working with the Commission staff to\ninsure that dissemination of the final report is avail¬\nable to educational radio as well as to other media.\nSincerely,\nRAM:lkl\nccs William G. Harley\nRobert A. Mott"
