Of these,\nthe demonstrations of the RCA system using three orthicon (or three vidicons)\nas well as the GE system using the field sequential color wheel were essentially\nrepeat performances of demonstrations made at previous conventions with some\nrefinements and alterations added. On the other hand, the equipment and methods\nshown by DuMont represent .a severe departure from practices now in use for\nstudio pickup of black and white as well'as color television pictures*\nSince there is a considerable amount of information a vail&Me elsewhere\nregarding the currently established picture pickup methods it would be\nsuperfluous to g© into detail herein regarding them* All have been shown to b©\nmore or less effective for particular usages and will continue to represent current\nstandards until newly proposed systems such as DuMont's can be proven in the\nfield. The DuMont system, therefore, merits extended comment herewith largely\nbecause of its contemporary nature rather than its proven superiority. Perhaps\nthe simplest method of explaining the DuMont system is to say that it represents\nan extension of \"flying spot\" scanner technique into the design of live studio\npickup apparatus* In order to effect such a system the flying spot light source is\nplaced on the camera dolly and banks of simple photoelectric cells are located at\nthe various points normally occupied by studio lights.\nAs the pencil of light emitting from the Hying spot source scans across\nthe various portions of the subject, the instantaneous reflected light from the scene\nis collected by the photo-cell banks, thus .generating the video signal.
