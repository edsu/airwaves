  "text": "Dr. Skornia\nFebruary 2, 1960\nPage 2\nters research information exchange; conducts research\nseminars when feasible, and serves in a consultative\ncapacity for research aspects of the projects of the\nassociation, its committees, or its members.\n3. 1 think that the present size of the committee has been satis¬\nfactory.\nA. Most of the committee work can be done by mail, except where\na seminar is to be planned or consultation is to be done.\n5. When it comes to means of seeking funds, I draw a blank. I\nam afraid that I am almost totally inexperiences in this area.\n6. Think that the committee you have named for 1960 is the best\nwe have ever had. If the caliber can be maintained for suc¬\nceeding years, you will be doing very well.\n7. The only other suggestions that I have were incorporated in\nthe letter which I sent you about two months ago, after a\nsimilar Inquiry about future committee directions.\nIf there is other information which we can provide, please let me\nknow.\nBy the way, a minor point but I have not been the Executive Secretary\nof this outfit for three years. This was the title I held for a year or\nso after we had a reorganization here. The Provost was acting Director\nat that time. I am now Director of the Division of Television, Radio,\nFilm. This has been caught on some of the records in your office but\nnot on all. Most Of the regular mailings of the association come to\nme under the old title and I see it again in the committee listings\nwhich you just sent.\nBest,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLB:ks"
