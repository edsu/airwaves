Most of the program\nservice is locally originated except for a small\nnumber of programs exchanged by audio tape through NERN\n(National Educational Radio Network of the NAEB), some\nprograms from foreign broadcasters obtained directly or\nthrough the Broadcasting Foundation of America, and\nsome programs transmitted by limited live hookups of\nstations within a state, such as Wisconsin, or a region,\nsuch as New England.\nFor the most part, these efforts are severely limited\nby lack of resources, both creative and financial. Also\nfor the most part, there is no certainty that non-local\nprograms will be heard at good listening times, since\ntheir scheduling depends entirely on the attitude of each\nlocal station's management. As a result, many educational\nradio stations have little distinctive character or sound.\nIn too many cases lack of funds and commitment produce\ninferior or amateurish programming.\nWith a few exceptions the overall result of this\nhodge-podge of educational radio is pitifully small\naudiences for individual stations and a lack of national\nvisibility and concern for educational radio in general.\nII The Basic System\nThis group feels that one of the ways educational\nradio can be useful and significant on a national basis\nis to develop a service of tightly-formatted, in-depth\nnational and international news and public affairs, with\nthe emphasis on analysis, commentary, criticism and good\ntalk, with variety supplied by \"actualities‚Äù, performances,\nand experimental productions which would explore the\nsound medium in terms relevant to the present."
