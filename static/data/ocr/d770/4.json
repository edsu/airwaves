These rep¬\nresentative songs could form some sort of a link between the broad¬\ncasting services.\nThe Secretariat would circulate a questionnaire to obtain inform¬\nation about the types of songs that members may be able to con¬\ntribute.\nThe songs would be supplied by members, preferably as tape record¬\nings, in their original form, with English translations added.\nEach country would supply two or three of its most popular songs."
