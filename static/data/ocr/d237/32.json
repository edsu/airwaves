I\nhave written to Mr. Edward G. Hasp, Jr. whose\nname was suggested in the list from Hew Jersey. I\nam not at all sure about Mr. King himself. Is he\nto be considered as a possible manager for an\neducational TV station? Of the group whose names\nwere submitted, Mr. Rasp seemed to me to be the\nbest qualified for consideration.\nYou may circularize the position of\nmanager or director (whichever title you think is\nbetter) for the station here in Denver.\nWe have assumed all along that we would\nhire a manager or director, and then, together\nwith him, hire the other key personnel of the\nstation excepting the engineer. We have in mind a\nperson who qualifies for the engineer for the\nstation.\nThank you for any assistance you may be\nable to give us.\nCordially yours.\nKVrineth E. Oberholt,\nSuperintendent of\nKEO:abc"
