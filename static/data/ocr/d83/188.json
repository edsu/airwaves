Tell me if I am mistaken in\nthis, but a book on the media of writing and film\nlike this one like a number of other books on\nmedia is so loaded with passages that to have them\nall typed out would be a far greater expense to\nthe project than the purchase of the book.\nI called Hariy Skomia to-day, just as he\nwas leaving for Chicago, to report the very\nprofitable and pleasant visit with Warren Seibert\nin Washington regarding the Second Phase of the\nProject. It is going to involve a great deal more\ntravel.\nVery beat wishes. /Jest'S\nHMM/RN Marshall McLuhan.\nEnel"
