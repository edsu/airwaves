  "text": "for its tape-duplication facility at Ann Arbor,\nMichigan.\nJohn E White, president of NET, characterized\nthe grants for videotape as \"the most significant\nadvance in ETY since the first station . . . began\noperations.” An hour’s worth of tape costs about\n$250, but it can be erased and used many times\nover. Classes or programs can be recorded at any\ntime during the day or week. Tape is a boon in\naccommodating ETV production and viewing to\nclass and teacher schedules. It permits the teacher\nto see himself as he appears on the screen; he\ncan travel to classrooms and see immediately how\nstudents react to his lesson and how they take\nnotes and ask questions in the follow-up.\nVideotape facilitates exchange of lessons and\nprograms among schools and colleges. Many col¬\nleges are now joining together in videotape net¬\nworks. In a few years, National Educational Tele¬\nvision will be primarily a videotape network.\nTape also facilitates re-runs. A class telecast live\nin the morning can be repeated on tape in the\nafternoon or evening. The ability to erase and\nedit also makes it possible to keep particularly\nvaluable recorded lectures or courses up to date\nas new information becomes available. Thus, tele¬\nvised lectures — like a professor’s notes on a sub¬\nject he teaches year after year —can be built on\na foundation of knowledge and experience and\naccommodate changes in the subject and in the\nteacher’s own intellectual growth."
