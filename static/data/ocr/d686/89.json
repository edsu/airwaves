In a survey\nmade not so long ago by the National Opinion Research Center, under the auspices of\nthe National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (which is the trade\norganization of the commercial broadcasters in this country) it was found that\nseventy percent of the American people were extremely pleased with the job that radio\nbroadcasting was doing;; that is, they thought radios overall performance Mexcellent\"\nor Mgoodtt. In this same survey, it was indicated people believed radio was doing a\nbetter job for the community than local government. A better job than local schools.\nA better job than the newspapers.\nNow, seventy percent is a fairly hefty figure, and the broadcasting industry\ntook it to its heart with no little jubilation.\nBut, let us turn these figures about for a moment-and what do we find!\nAbout 30 percent of a nation is not happy with the job being done by American radio.\nAlmost one-third of all the people in this country feel their needs are not being\nmet-or that they are not being given the required service in terms of what a\nfree radio should undertake in a democracy.\nOn the other hand, there is no gainsaying that the broadcasting industry has\nachieved a pinnacle of stupendous achievement, because no other medium can sell soap\nor cigarettes or gasoline so fast and so often.\nBut many of us-even more, I should say, than the 30 percent stipulated in\nthe survey I have just quoted â€” feel, along with the F.C.C., that there is a public-\nservice function essential to broadcasting. We may then offer the question as to why\nthere is a paucity of adult, literate programming with its concomitant of ideas?"
