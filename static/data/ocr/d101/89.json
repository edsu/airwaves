  "text": "October 8, 1959\nMr. Ken Kager\nRadio Station KUOW\nThe University of Washington\nSeattle 5, Washington\nDear Ken:\nLee Dreyfuss of Wayne State just called me this morning to\nsee whether I would take over the responsibility for a section\non radio research at the upcoming NAEB meeting. This is rather\nshort notice and, unfortunately, it seems to me to be one which\nis sorely in need of some attention — so, like a mad man, 1\naccepted. The point of this letter, of course, is that X hope\nyou are coming to Detroit for the meeting and that you will\nbe willing to expound for 15 or 20 minutes on your personal\ninfluence study — the sort of thing which you included in\nthe abstract which you sent around plus. Ideally, your ideas\nfor where we ought to go from here with future research efforts\nin this general area. The meeting will be from 9:00 to 10 a.m.,\nThursday, October 29. X am trying to get Jack Ellery of Wayne\nto do something on their FM study and then, perhaps, someone\nwho has done some decent research on in-school radio.\nI hope that I can hear from you soon in the affirmative.\nBest regards,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevlslon-Kadlo-Fllm\nSLBsks"
