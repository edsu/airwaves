I have broached this subject to\nhim, and I think there is a better than even chance that he\nwill accept an invitation if you choose to extend one.\nHe is principally concerned about the problems of producing\neducational programs and the inefficiency inherent in the\nsystem we are now employing under the terms of the Lowell\ngrant. I think he would like to talkthrough the general\nproblem with the membership of the NAEB, and perhaps get\ntheir suggestions regarding an operating plan which might be\nadvanced by the Fund.\nI should be glad to know what disposition you make of this\nsuggestion.\nBest regards.\n/s/ Robert B. Hudson\nDirector\nRBH:nv\n# # *\nThese letters are forwarded to members of the Board by V/aldo\nAbbot without comment.\nW. A."
