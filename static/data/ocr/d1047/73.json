Miles\nDirector\nW8AA Fadlo - TV Unit\nLafayette, Indiana\nDear Jim:\nLeafing through my moldy old communiques I\ncame across a short note from you relative to whether\nwe should attempt to hold a Begion III convocation\nthis year.\nObviously we did not get around to discussing\nthis at the Chicago get-together, but I should like\nto Indicate that I’m all In favor of it....providing\nHeadquarters has available funds. I am of the Impression\nthat we would have to alternate among the regions to\nsome extent because of financial stringencies, but if\nIt can be managed I would certainly favor holding a\nBeglon III meeting. There are good reasons for taking\nthe position that every one of the regions should hold\na meeting this particular year of decision. As a\ndemocratic-membership based association It. is imperative\nthat the officers have the full support of the member¬\nship In making major moves. Although I feel I got\nconsiderable general sanction at the regional meetings\nI attended last year In favor of the move to Washington,\nthe radio network disposal to the Center may be quite a\ndifferent thing. There are already some indications in\nthis early stage of negotiations that some of our member¬\nship are unhappy about such a prospect and may break away\nand begin splinter networks of their own. Some of this\nmay be largely emotionalism and can be diminished considerably\nIf we have an opportunity to talk these things over at regional\nmeetings and explain the facts of life behind the proposed\nmove to them*\nSo, I’m for It...but not at Kellogg, the robbers!\nCordially,\nWilliam G* Harley\nWGHicp\nCC: HSkornia"
