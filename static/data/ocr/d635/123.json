Perhaps there\nwas some reason for you to make a personal trip to\nNorth Carolina, but I thought you could just as well\nhave offered Wynn the job by means of a single tele¬\nphone call. I presume, however, that there must be\ncompelling reasons for you to take the journey.\nI still do not agree with your idea of inviting repre¬\nsentatives of Foundations and other educational groups\nin connection with the place that NAEB will have in\nthe television picture. ... at least until we have decided\nour own sphere of influence by ourselves. I fear that\nat such a Board Meeting we would be washing our linens\na la Battle Creek,\nBest wishes.\nSeymour N. Siegel\nPresident\nsns/t"
