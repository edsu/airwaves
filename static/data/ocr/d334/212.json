  "text": "- 6 -\nRESULTS\nIn the Spring of 1964, the initial mailing of 296\nquestionnaires was sent out. An additional 117 were mailed\nto individuals suggested by respondents of the first mailing.\nOf the total of 413 questionnaires which were distributed,\n157 were returned. Of these there were 129 useful forms;\n20 people declared themselves not to be researchers after\nall, and eight others read a stricter definition than was\nintended into the word \"broadcasting,\" and stated that they\ndid not do \"broadcasting\" research.\nThis return of fewer than a third of the questionnaires\nprovided negative reinforcement to support the Committee's\nbelief in the need for communication among researchers, but\nfrom those individuals who did complete the questionnaire,\nsome interesting and provocative information was obtained.\nGeographic Location\nThe geographic location of the respondents indicates\nthat they are spread fairly evenly around the country with\nthe least representation in NAEB regions 4 and 5, from\nnorth to south between the Rockies and the Mississippi River.\n(See Table 1.)\n6See footnote, p. 1."
