I have discussed this matter with Betty\nMcKenzie. We feel that since Walter Emeiy has offered to help with any\nlegal problems, and since he is the retiring editor, he might well be\nasked to remain. However, if you agree that it would be well for Colby\nLewis, our new editor, to be on the committee too, that would be three\nMichigan Staters. This doesnâ€™t bother Betty or me particularly, but it\nmight someone else.\nOther possibilities we have thought of are Harry Skornia, Ted Conant,\nDave Bell, Hartford Gunn, and Len Press.\nWould you please react to these suggestions, adding any other\npossibilities that would strengthen the composition of the committee.\nCordially yours.\nH. V. Cordier, Head\nDepartment of Radio/TV\nC/rjg"
