  "text": "The University of Minnesota as licensee could not legally divest itself\nof actual program operation and decision as to performance standards and\npredetermined policy5 but with good faith between the University and\nthe other educational groups, institutions end agencies in the state,\nthe Commission would for all practical purposes determine basic station\npolicies, subject to FCC regulations and a delegstion of authority by\nthe University Regents®\nThere is precedent to indicate how station licensees do accept outside\nprogram guidance* Every network station is individually re sponsible\nbefore the lew for the network programs it carries. Yet such stations\nrarely know or are concerned about the exact contents of their network\nprogramsj in effect, therefore, they delegate responsibility to a network\nwhich they arc certain will maintain acceptable program standards. Many\nexamples also could be cited of educational institutions and agencies in\nour own state which in feet have complete independence of program judgment\nin broadcasting over local commercial end educational stations of which\nthey are not the licensees®\nE, SUMMARY\nWith the University of Minnesota as licensee working with a Minnesota\nEducational Television Commission as here proposed, it would be possible\nfar the entire educational community of the state to participate in the\npolicy-directr.on of a state-wide educational television network c This\narrangement would also insure program contributions from many institutions\nsad agencies»\nSubject to the policy direction of the Commission, the University of\nMinnesota fcs licensee would administer the stations as trustee for the\neducational community of the state® The University — the; natural focal\npoint for a state-wide educational activity of such broad scope — would\noffer the project its extensive broadcasting experience and program resources\nas well B3 e longesteblished service organization, thus permitting the\nproject staff to concentrate its major efforts on the development of on\neducational television broadcasting service®"
