IJve never seen, to the best\nof my knowledge, any such criteria. Certainly, the oral remarks which I have had\nhanded to me in judgment of several series which we have offered were stupid and\nlacked any conviction.\nVery often. Network offerings carry programs whose subject mavter is the same as\ncurrent or recent offerings over our station. We tape these programs and put them\nin the \"morgue11 to U3e later on. IJve heard criticisms to the effect that a voice\nwas not that of a \"John Daily\" even though the subject matter was tops and the\n\"voice\" was a person with a national reputation in his field.\nIt is ray opinion that the whole NbTv ORh. operation calls for a genuine and thorough\noverhauling, looking to some sound principles of organization and operation or itfs\ndoomed to go the way of the dodo."
