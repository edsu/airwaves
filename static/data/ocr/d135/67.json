Can find him listed\nas expert on no national panels or programs, and he seems to be member of\nno professional groups in the field•• Do not question his testing and measure¬\nments qualifications, but feel he perhaps should be applying in that capacity\n(in education) rather than as a Radio-TV Specialist.\nHI Harry M. Lyle\nYes; Have been badgered a great deal by him, in search of jobs,\nevery few years.\nSeveral personal problems. Now unemployed again. Rubs people wrong way.\nIn my opinion would not be a good representative of the U. S. abroad.\nIII-A Robert E. Belding\nNo.\nI do not mean to be snobbish. But I know the Radiodiffusion Television\nFrancaise people very well and believe that Dr. Belding’s academic qualifications\nmight not impress them as much as they might if they were from better-known\nor more emphatically academic institutions. Here again I have reservations\nabout his ability to represent the U. S. in ETV and radio; I can find no\nknowledge of him among educational radio and TV people of the caliber which\nthe RDTF consults in the U. S.\n1(3) Noel L. Jordan\nNo\nI wish his emphasis were less on the commercial view of ETV and\nradio. However, this may be what they are looking for at RDTF. Obviously\nvery good producer"
