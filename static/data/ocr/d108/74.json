It is by no means\ndecided, Mr, Overton was here last week, took your letter with him and\na duplicate tape which he will play for the board of directors in New York,\nEnclosed is script No, 7, Program No, 8 will have the noted\nTokyo art critie Elsie Grilli ( now a naturalized American citizen)\nand will also feature a Japanese who conducts a tour called ” Art Around\nTown,” The entire program ( other than highlights in the News) will be\non art,., traditional Japanese art as seen, understood, and appreciated by\nWesterners and the Japanese themselves. The script is not yet finished, and\nas I*ve warned, many things go awmy over here, I hope to record fthis the\n29th of June, You will note a change in music starting with Program No,\n7 which is Japanese march music to introduce the Highlights section, and\nwhich is an improvement over the former. Program No, 9,, if it wrfcks out\nis on Music, So much for now, and thanks for the cooperation and prompt\nreplies."
