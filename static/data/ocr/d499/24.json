C.\nDear Leonard*\nEncouraged by your offer of help, I have made two\nmoves on the international organizational front.\nI renewed our membership in EBU ($1,500) and I\nmade a formal application to ABU with the underÂ¬\nstanding that our membership charge would be $1,000.\nSee attached reply.\nYou indicated that you would be willing to seek\n$5,000, which would insure NAEB of continuing both\nmemberships over a two year period.\nShortly, I will be sending along a proposal for a\nnew radio project for the consideration of the\nNational Home Library Foundation.\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:mab\nAttachment"
