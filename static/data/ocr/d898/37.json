Be adding one or two individuals to the network staff, we\nshould improve the efficiency and competency of the organization.\nPersonnel funds will total about 20,000 dollars.\nFinally, we will use a share of the money — less than 10 thousand\ndollars to purchase a stock of audio tape. Currently the network\nhas a large tape pool. Our plan is to purchase tape stock on\n10 inch reels and all future music programs will be distributed on\nthe lai:£er reels — thus eliminating a variety of production\nproblems both at the network headquarters and in the individual\nstations.\nThe grant was made available to NERN for utilization in calendar\n1969.\nWe expect to expend the first funds for tape acquisition sometime\nin July — we anticipate employing personnel as needed about Sept¬\nember 1 — and we have already begun the process of program ac-\nquisit&onaand development. It is our plan to have programs and\nseries in distribution to stations on or before October 1.\nThus the benefits of the $65,000 CPB fcrant to NERN will be realized\nin the last quarter of 1969. We are confident that educational\nradio stations will be pleased with the new programs that will be\nmade available to them."
