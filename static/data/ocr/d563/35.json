Levis\nDirector\nFord Foundation ETV Project in Vermont\nPomeroy Hall\nUniversity of Vermont\nBurlington, Vermont\nDear Mr. Levis:\nReturning from a trip abroad 1 found your letter together\nwith a carbon of a reply from Dave Stewart. Mr. Stewart has\ncovered the waterfront so well X feel there is not much I can\nadd in response to your questions. All of your suggestions\nare excellent and I trust that you will follow through as you\nhave indicated. j\nX feel very strongly that this is the critical time for\nthis legislation. I doubt if there will ever be as good a\nchance again; and likelihood of success is, in large measure,\ngoing to depend upon whether there is early consideration by\nthe Rules Committee of this legislation so that the House will\nhave a chance to consider it. Unless he can get action very\nearly in the session, there is not much likelihood of obtaining\nany action on ETV during this Congress.\nX agree with Mr. Stewart's estimation of the members of\nthe Rules Committee who are likely to be opposed or, at least,\ndoubtful. X suspect not much can be done with Mr. Avery or\nMr. Brown, but it doesn't hurt to try.\nObviously, initial attention must be given to the Rules\nCommittee, since action by this group is a prerequisite to\nany further action* However, there will not be time to make\na proper contact with members of the House after the Rules\nCommittee acts, so it is important to contact your RepresentÂ¬\natives now so that they can be alerted and, hopefully, in a\nreceptive mood if and when the bill gets to the House.\nWe appreciate your suggestions and will be pleased to\nreceive any other ideas which may occur to you for advancing\nthis legislation.\nSincerely yours.\nwr,H?t\nWilliam G. Harley"
