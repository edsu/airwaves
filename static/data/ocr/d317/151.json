From now on, I*m sure you*11 be pleased to note, things\nwill go much more smoothly and efficiently in the planning of this\nevent. I had anticipated my successor taking over much earlier\nthan this and consequently have been letting things slide a bit,\nIâ€™m afraid, until almost too late.\nI was aware that Irv Merrill was working with you but just\nfelt that it was better not to name two people from the same\nplace to the general convention committee. However, Jim may do\nas he chooses about thi% expanding the original committee or naming\nother committees. Perhaps Irv might be chairman of the Local\nArrangements Committee.\nI am pleased to learn that we can now have the Thursday\nafternoon and evening sessions in the Kellogg Center and 1 would\nagree with you that it would be preferable to have the Friday\nbanquet there also. If Jim's noon-to-noon schedule is adopted},\nthe banquet, of course, would be on Thursday night.\n1*11 forward your letter to Miles so that he can have the\ninformation on contacts at East Lansing.\nCordially,\nWilliam 6. Harley\nWGH: jc\ncc: Jim Miles"
