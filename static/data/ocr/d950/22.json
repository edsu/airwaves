  "text": "Prof. Frank Schooley, Director\nJuly 7, 1958\nPago 2\nsurvey of printing costs of program schedules and the Utilization\nStudy Group suggested another type of survey. This la the kind\nof work which does not taka an expert in research but rather someÂ¬\none who knows what sort of information is needed. For this reason,\nit would seem to me best for each of these committees to do such\nfact-finding surveys themselves. Members of the research conndttee\nare available for consultation on questionnaire design, sampling\nmethods (if such are needed), or statistical techniques in the\nunlikely event that tests of results were wanted. What do you think\nabout this? 1 do think that such surveys should be coordinated\nsomehow so that the NAZB isn't spending ten times as much as it\nneeds to for questionnaires and postage. I also think that it would\nbe helpful if a file of all such surveys were kept on file at one\nor two central places. Xt would seem to me to make the most sense\nto keep a copy of each at headquarters and a copy of each in the\nfiles of the research committee. Xn this way, between us, we could\nhelp people avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.\nX guess that's it. After August 15th, and until early June,\n1959, X can be reached c/o Dr. Hans Salzmann, 514 W. 110th 8t.,\nNew York 25, New York. Congratulations on the appointment. If you\nget to New York, give us a call so that we can get together for a\ndrink ( You too, Harry).\nSincerely,\nSam h. Becker, Chairman\nNASB Research Committee\nSLBimw\ncc: Dr. Harry Skoraia"
