As I Indicated to\nyou on the phone a month or so ago, we have to be extremely\ncareful that we do not exceed our budget. Hot in any \"scold-\ning\" sense, but so that you may be completely aware of the\nsituation, I thought I would call your attention to a few of\nthe problems that are highlighted by our December 31 fiscal\nstatement.\nJfeilisg Expense\nTelephone\nEquipsexxt and Repairs\nJournal\nnewsletter\nl&scellaneous Publications\nBudgeted\nImpended\n$ 350\n$ 447\n275\n226\n25\n139\n10,000\n7,670\n2,400\n1,400\n1,000\n1,500\nAll this has gone on; our income has fallen slightly below\nour anticipated level.
