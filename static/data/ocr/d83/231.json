The CBC is\ngoing to provide some coaching on graphics, and Art Knowles,\nray Research man from the Ottawa Film Board, is delighted\nthat we are plunging into the visual field. He pointed out\nthat it would be helpful to keep in mind, from the start,\ncustomfs problems when setting up these materials. He\nsaid that as long as there was an educational seal forthÂ¬\ncoming, from both Ottawa and Washington, that the movement\nof video or kinescope, back and forth, would be simple.\nI shall call Dick Evans, to-morrow, and also hasten\nn$r Syllabus materials into shape for an immediate classroom\nrun.\nShall be in touch with you soon,"
