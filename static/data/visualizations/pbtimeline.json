        "headline": "Iowa State College's WOI pioneers radio transmission in Morse Code",
        "text": "<p>In 1911, Iowa State College physics professor \"Dad\" Hoffman rigged a transmission line from the campus water tower to Engineering Hall and asked for money to establish a wireless telegraph station. Most likely the first transmission from Iowa State took place in 1912. Newspaper reports from 1913 indicate station 9YI was regularly sending and receiving weather reports by morse code. In 1915, the engineers packed up their equipment and went to the Iowa State Fair to demonstrate the amazing new technology. The first non-code broadcast took place on November 21, 1921--an hour of concert music. The following April, the Commerce Department issued a license for station WOI and the first regular broadcast took place on April 22, 1922.\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of the station's first regular features was market news. Announcers read commodity prices gathered by ticker tape and morse code. But there were other programs, too. In the fall of 1922, the station broadcast its first Iowa State football game. And in 1925, Andy Woolfries began The Music Shop--one of the longest running programs in radio history, still on the air today on WOI-FM. Another long-time favorite, The Book Club began in 1927. \n<p>\n  Broadcasting was exclusively on the AM band until the late 1940's. On December 1, 1949, WOI-FM became one of the first stations in Iowa to transmit with Frequency Modulation. Always pioneering new technologies, WOI-TV began broadcasting on channel 4 in 1954. (That station is no longer licensed to Iowa State University.) WOI-FM began stereo broadcasts in 1955.\n<strong>&#8212 Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19961220172117/http://www.iastate.edu/~woi/history/history.html\">A Short Version of the Long History of WOI Radio</a> (archived at the Wayback Machine)\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Related Materials at Unlocking the Airwaves</em></strong>:\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/airwaves/search/?f=creator:WOI%20(Radio%20station%20:%20Ames,%20Iowa)\">WOI (Radio station : Ames, Iowa)</a><em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Related Collections at University of Maryland</em></strong>:\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111104214343/http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1565\">Burt Harrison\nPapers</a>:<em><a href=\"/web/20111104214343/http://www.lib.umd.edu/NPBA/oral/hull.html\">Richard B.

        "text": "<p>In 1917, the University of Wisconsin's station 9XM experiments with music transmissions from phonograph records. 9XM is allowed to remain on the air during World War I for experiments with the U.S. Army and Navy. Throughout 1918-19, 9XM makes experimental voice transmissions with the Army, and the first documented clear transmission of human speech occurs.\n</p>\n<p>\nA regular schedule of voice broadcasts begins in 1921 and 9XM is the first radio station in the United States to provide the weather forecast by voice (Jan. 3). In September, farm market broadcasts are added. On Nov. 1, 9XM carries the first live broadcast of a symphony orchestra -- the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra from the UW Armory using a single microphone.\n<p>\nOn Jan. 13, 1922, 9XM is relicensed by the US Commerce Department and becomes one of the first educational institutions (along with WLB at the University of Minnesota) to be granted a license in the new \"limited commercial\" category for broadcasting. On March 15 of that year 9XM becomes WHA, debuting its first news program, a weekly offering consisting of material from the University Press Bulletin.\n<strong>&#8212 Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/wprs-tradition-innovation\">WPR's Tradition Of Innovation</a>, at the Wisconsin Public Radio website\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Related Materials at Unlocking the Airwaves</em></strong>:\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/airwaves/search/?f=creator:WHA%20(Radio%20station%20:%20Madison,%20Wis.)\">WHA (Radio station : Madison, Wis.)</a></li>\n   <li> <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/airwaves/search/?q=wlb\">Search hits for WLB at the University of Minnesota</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Related Collections at University of Maryland</em></strong>:\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111104214339/http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1565\">Burt Harrison\nPapers</a>: <a href=\"/web/20111104214339/http://www.lib.umd.edu/NPBA/oral/mccarty.html\"><em>Harold B.
