It is being sent to all members of AEJ.\nThere are several purposes, including the desire to get answers\nto questions such as these, as an aid in planning:\na. What parts of the Quarterly are of most interest?\nb. How do journalism teachers use the Quarterly?\nc. What do they read in it?\nd. How can it be made more useful?\ne. Should it be issued more frequently?\nf. How do journalism teachers feel about the type\nof presentation?\ng. What additional types of material are needed?\nWe hope you will answer the questionnaire as fully as possible.\nMost of the answers are '’check\" type, which means the questionnaire is\nreally shorter than it looks. A pre-test indicates you can probably\nfill it out in about 15 minutes--and we hope you’ll make this \"time\ncontribution\" to help provide more information on attitudes toward\nthe Quarterly.\nWhen you've finished the questionnaire, just mail it back in\nthe reply envelope. If you want an extra copy, send us a card or a\nnote--\nLeslie G. Moeller"
