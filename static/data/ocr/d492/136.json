I’m not quite sure at all that\nNeGR ES ARE MORE EMOTIONAL DY NATURE, ARE MORE\nRELIGIOUS BY ATURE. But THEY’VE CERTAINLY, IN THIS\nC UNTRY, BEEN MUCH M CR E RESTRICTED IN THEIR OPPOR¬\nTUNITIES, AND THIS RESTRICTION MEANS THAT IN THE\nCHANNELS THAT ARE OPEN TO THEM THEY HAVE MADE FULL\nUSE OF THESE CHANNELS.\nMUSIC:\nSTINGER\nNNCR :\nThat was Dr. Paul De.mTS of the Boston University\nSchool of The^l.-<gy from whom we shall hear more\nAS WE Take up the subject of religion IN DISCUSSING\nthe Negro in .-u-e* i ca , \"The Last Citizen.'\nMUSIC:\nSTINGER\nmCR :\nThe Last Citizen: The Negro in America.

R1 CHTER .\nRICHTER:\nThe American Negro has by criteria of church member¬\nship BEEN CERTAINLY AS DEVOUT A CHRISTIAN AS THE\nAMERICAN WHITE MAN. But THE HOUSE OF CHRISTIANITY\nITSELF IS NOTORIOUSLY SPLIT ON COLOR LINES. In HIS\nCLASSIC STUDY ON THE SOCIAL SOURCES OF DENCM 1 NATION¬\nAL 1 SM , THE THEOLOGIAN H. RlCHARD N|EBUHR MADE A\nREMARK TO THE EFFECT THAT THE VARIOUS CHURCHES OF\nChristendom have been unable to weave a single * .\nGARMENT OF CHRIST TO FIT THE SEAMLESS VESTURE OF HI\nspirit. Surely, if this comment applies anywhere r\nAPPLIES TO THE CASE OF THE HE.VILY SEGREGATED NeGRC\nchurches.
