  "text": "3. Applications may be submitted by any bona fide univer¬\nsity, college, school system or other accredited educational\ninstitution, or NAEB Active or Associate member, though\nno preference will be given to NAEB members.\n4. Individual grants will not exceed $7,000.00. Applications\nasking for considerably less than this maximum amount\nwill receive full consideration. No grant will include funds\nfor capital expenditures.\n5. By definition, grants-in-aid cannot carry the full burden\nof production costs (they are intended to help educational\nbroadcasters to help themselves). As an example, a grantee\nmay thus be enabled to employ a key person or otherwise\nstrengthen or supplement local resources to make the pro¬\nduction possible or outstanding.\n6. All programs produced under these grants must be suitable\nfor use on the NAEB Radio Network.\n7. Full radio rights to the programs and television rights to\nidea, format and script, must be obtained for all program\nmaterials included; these rights become the property of\nthe Educational Television and Radio Center.\n8. Applications must be in writing. Six copies of all written\nmaterial and exhibits must be supplied, together with a\nstatement of the staff and facilities available for the project\nand a pilot program on tape.\n9. Grants will be made on the basis of these applications;\nthus completeness and understandability of presentation\nare vital.\n10. Deadline for applications is May 1, 1958; all applications\nmust be received at NAEB headquarters or post-marked by\nthat date. The announcement of grants will be on June 15,\n1958.\n11. Production of all projects must start 90 days after the grant\nis made, unless, as shall be clearly explained in the appli¬\ncation, a valid reason exists for a later starting date. In this\ncase an extension to not over 120 days from date of grant\nmay be authorized."
