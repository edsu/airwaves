To what extent?\nIf the Network begins distribution of a series of 9 half-hour programs at the\nbeginning of a 13 week broadcast season, there will be a \"gap\" of 4 weeks in the\ndistribution schedule after the end of the series. If Headquarters has on hand\na series of 3 or 4 half-hour programs, it can \"fill in\" with these. But if Head¬\nquarters does not have a short series on hand, should it begin a new 13 week series\nimmediately or wait until the beginning of the next season?\nWhat is the best time for broadcast seasons to begin?\nShould all new series of 13 programs begin with the same issue?\nThese and many other questions are raised in the course of the Network oper¬\nation. The value of the Network service depends to a great extent upon the answers\narrived at. To be sure that we have the right answers, we would like you to give\nthem to us.\nThe enclosed questionnaire covers a number of these questions.
