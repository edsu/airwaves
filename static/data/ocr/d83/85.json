This is in reply to your letter of June 8\nThe report and letter seem, to my unpracticed eye, to say all the\nthings which we need to know. I'm sending them on to Kal for his\nreview and the necessary actions. The small anticipated balance\nin your account is something over which we cannot and need not be\nconcerned.\nThanks very much for the materials. Let us know of anyÂ¬\nthing further which we may be in a position to do.\nSincerely yours,\nWarren F. Seibert\nSenior Research Coordinator\nEducational Media Branch"
