Acda\nHead Central Program Service\nRadio Netherland Wereldomroep\nHilversum, Nederland\nDear Mr. Acda:\nI cannot resist your gracious invitation, even though it\ncomes at an extremely busy time for me. If it is agreeable\nfor me to arrive in Hilversum the morning of October 10th and\nreturn the night of the 13th, I can come.\nI have delayed answering your letter, not because of any\nlack of interest - on the contrary! It was because I wanted so\nmuch to accept that I worked to shift things in ay schedule in\norder to take advantage of your generous invitation.\nExploring possible flight schedules of KIM, 1 find that\nI could leave New York October 9 at 9:30 pm, arriving in\nAmsterdam at 8:40 am, October 10. I could get a return flight\nat 6:30 pa, October 13. This would get me back in Washington\nso that I could spend the week-end with my family before having\nto leave for the International Seminar on Instructional TV\nat Purdue University.\nAs you know from correspondence with Mr. Burrows, we have\nbeen experiencing some difficulties in obtaining fully reliable\n\"pick-ups'* of your transmissions. We are working on arrange¬\nments with WILL, at the University of Illinois, Urbana, to\nacquire a new short wave receiver. We are confident that this\nwill improve the reliability of our reception.\nWe are enthusiastic about the possibilities of this\ninternational program project and feel it will make a dis¬\ntinctive and unique contribution to the schedules of our\nmember radio stations."
