And even to Americans, accustomed to\na Democratic party broad enough to cover Harry S. Truman and Harry P. Byrd,\nor a Eepublican party heterogeneous enough to embrace Senator George Aiken o\nVermont on one hand and senator John Brisker of Ohio on the other — even to\nu®, the Christian Democracy is an astonishing coalition*\nA couple of years ago an American Journalist, Leo J* Wallenberg, des¬\ncribed the Christian Democratic party as *’a rainbow with a spectrum ranging\nall the way from a faint pink to a Fascist black, or at least gray. And an*\nItalian writer has referred to the party as \"a very peculiar and treacherous\norganism.\" It is, said this writer, \"an amalgam of a mass party, a politics\nmachine, and & medley of conflicting economic interests, each component de¬\npending on a different center of force*\" This Italian writer thought the\nmass party was provided by the tie with the Catholic church* The political"
