They never will, if we stick to\nconventional education methods. Their only fighting chance is through\nthe spread of electronic techniques. On a broader canvas, these same\ntechniques might also give sill people, literate and illiterate, a fighting\nchance to live in peace. For, as Lord Attlee has said: \"Since wars\nbegin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses\nof peace must be constructed.\"\nIt is in the minds of men, too, that the campaign to upgrade\nour educational standards will be won — or lost. For even in a world\nof power, the power of ideas remains supreme.\nWe — you and I and all those involved in this field — can\nmove the full realization of educational TV from the Twenty-Fourth\nCentury to the Twentieth if we act promptly and decisively."
