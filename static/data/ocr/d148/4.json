The previous en-\naohng legislation for the Army and Air\nForce expired on April 1, and the Navy\nhas been' operating its program under\nauthority of annual appropriation bills.\nUnder the new bill, “educational op¬\nportunities may be provided by means\nof service operated or sponsored cor¬\nrespondence courses, locally conducted\nacademic classes, or such facilities as\nmay be made available by those coop¬\nerating civilian educational institutions\nas may be recognized as accredited by\nthe Office of Education. . . or by the\ndepartments of education of the respec¬\ntive states.” Tuition assistance to serv¬\nice personnel is authorized in amounts\nnot exceeding “50 per centum of such\ntuition fees charged by cooperating civil¬\nian educational institutions in the case\nof officer personnel or 75 per centum\nof such tuition fees in the case of en¬\nlisted personnel.”\nThe greatest danger to this legislation\nis lack of interest rather than oppo¬\nsition in Congress. Institutions de¬\nsiring early action on the bill should\ncommunicate with Senator Leverett\nSaltonstall, chairman of the Committee\non Armed Services of the Senate, and\nRepresentative Dewey Short, chairman of\nthe Committee on Armed Services of the\nHouse . . .\nS 971, which provides that postal rates\nfor film and other audio-visual mate¬\nrials for instructional use by schools and\ncolleges shall be the same as those for\nbooks, was passed by the Senate on May\n21 and is pending in the House as HR\n1939. This legislation was endorsed by\nthe Committee on Relationships at its\nmeeting on May 29, and its action has\nbeen communicated to the House Com¬\nmittee on Post Office and Civil Service.\nThat committee is expected to report\nthe bill to the floor soon, following hear¬\nings scheduled to open on June 10.\nThose interested should write their own\nRepresentatives in the House.\n*From Higher Education, June 12, 1953.\nPurdue Center\nPurdue University is planning for con¬\nstruction of a “miniature” steel mill\non the 168-acre campus of the Center in\nHammond, Indiana.\nThe proposed 152 by 200-foot brick\nbuilding will be a two-story “industrial\nresearch institute” structure that will\ncost an estimated $600,000. It will be\nused for additional classrooms and for\nan inland steel company research labora¬\ntory.\nD. Mack Easton\nProfessor D. Mack Easton has been\nappointed the new Dean of Extension\nat the University of Colorado to succeed\nW. M. Campbell, who writes: “You\nwill find Mr. Easton a valuable mem¬\nber of the NUEA. He is exceptional\nas a presiding officer and in leading\ndiscussion. I predict for him a suc¬\ncessful administration as Dean of Ex¬\ntension. I am happy to see him take\n,\"\"ir Extension at the University ***\nColorado. We have worked together\nfor several years to strengthen the posi¬\ntion of Extension in Colorado, and I\npredict that our efforts will produce\nresults under Mack’s direction.\n“Both Easton and I worked with the\nCommittee of the Senate on Utiliza¬\ntion of University Resources. The re¬\nport of this Committee which provides\nfor some rather far-reaching changes in\nthe administration of Extension was ap¬\nproved unanimously last month. It\ncalls for the coordination of all Ex¬\ntension activities under a committee of\nthe deans of which the Dean of Exten¬\nsion will be chairman. It also calls for\nmore financial support to Extension and\na considerable, though gradual, expan¬\nsion of Extension Services.\n“I appreciate very much the connection\nI have had with the NUEA as Director\nhere and hope to continue to serve\nthe cause in the future.”\nMr. Easton has been Director of the\nUniversity’s Bureau of State and Com¬\nmunity Service since 1944. He will suc¬\nceed Mr. Campbell who will retire July\n1 after 30 years with the University.\nMr. Campbell was the “one man staff”\nof the Bureau of Class Instruction, now\none of the largest bureaus of the Divi¬\nsion, when he joined the University in\n1923. In mid-1951 he was appointed\nthe Division Director.\nIn announcing Dean Easton’s appoint¬\nment, the regents commented that nu¬\nmerous outstanding candidates from out¬\nside the state had been considered be¬\nfore the final selection. Mr. Easton has\nbeen with the University since 1929, be¬\ning first associated with the Speech\nDepartment. He was on leave in\n1942-43 to be director of War Services\nfor the State of Colorado and 1951-52\nto be Dean of the Staff College of the\nFederal Civil Defense Administration,\ncum laude from Huron College, Huron,\nSouth Dakota, and a M.A. from Cornell\nUniversity, Ithaca, New York.\nHoward Walker\nThomas Howard Walker will become\ndirector of University Extension at the\nUniversity of Kansas effective Septem¬\nber 1.\nWalker, a 39-year-old Indianan, is now\ndirector of the Mobile center of the Uni¬\nversity of Alabama. Before going south\nto organize the Mobile center three years\nago he was for three years director of\nthe Richmond center of Indiana Uni¬\nversity.\nThe 6’ 4” Walker will receive the doc¬\ntorate degree this fall from Indiana Uni¬\nversity, where he earned an M.S. degree\nin 1947. He received the A.B. degree\nin 1938 from Earlham College, Rich¬\nmond, Indiana, having majored in Eng¬\nlish and physical education. Walker’s\nteaching experience spans rural, junior\nand senior high schools. At Indiana\nUniversity he was supervisor of the test¬\ning bureau and later assistant to the\ndirector of Veterans’ affairs while tak¬\ning graduate work.\nDr. Frank T. Stockton, dean of Uni¬\nversity Extension since 1947, will become\ndirector of special projects in the di¬\nvision of University Extension. Dean\nStockton has served one year beyond\nthe customary retirement age for ad¬\nministrators pending the selection of a\nsuccessor.\n“Because of the great growth in vol¬\nume and scope of extension work dur¬\ning Dean Stockton’s administration, we\nhave most carefully sought a successor,”\nChancellor Murphy of Kansas said. “In\nMr. Walker we are gaining a tested ad¬\nministrator with the breadth of personal\ninterests and experience to provide\nKansas citizens with the educational\nservices they are increasingly asking of\nour extension program.”\nIllinois\nThe 6th annual conference on adult\neducation is scheduled for June 30th\nat Urbana on the campus of the Uni¬\nversity. The principal address is by\nDean Robert B. Browne on “Developing\nAdult Educators.” The conference is\nsponsored by the Illinois Adult Educa¬\ntion Association and the Summer Ses¬\nsion of the University."
