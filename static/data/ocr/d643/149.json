It might bring about a new definition\nof goals and objectives. It might lead to basic changes, both within\nand among the organizations involved* In regard to their work In\neducational broadcasting. In the last analysis, of course, it would\nnot necessarily enhance the role of the NAEB, nor alter Its relationship\nto the work now being done by other groups in the field.\nOur purpose In thinking of such a group self-appraisal Is to\nadvance the cause of educational broadcasting. As the preamble to\nthe NAEB constitution declares:\n\"Believing that radio and television broadcasting are most\nimportant factors and influences In the national and International\nwelfare, we, the representatives of educational, cultural and\npublic service institutions, organizations, agencies and\nassociations engaged in educational and cultural broadcasting,\ndo associate ourselves to promote, by united effort and mutual\ncooperation, the dissemination of knowledge. Information, and\neducation to the end that the educational, cultural and technical\nbenefits of broadcasting may be extended to all.\nSuch objectives, it seems to me, .constitute a good guide for NAEB and\nfor all others involved in educational broadcasting, as we enter what\nwe hope will prove to be\nA HAPPY NEW YEARS"
