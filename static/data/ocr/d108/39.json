This is not to tell you what you should record,\nof course, but merely an attempt to be helpful. I believe you have in the\npast expressed curiosity about some of these programs.\nThese recordings need not be preserved. You may erase them and use\nthe tape for your own series.\nDid I tell you that I'm leaving the NAEB next Wednesday? Going to\nNew York. It 11 send you my address when it* s again permanent. Your con¬\ntact here will be my successor, Robert E, Underwood, Jr.\nSincerely,\nJHjcr\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager"
