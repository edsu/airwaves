I *d planned three days and already have\nreservations, so won’t change unless I become too much\nof a burden, I’d guess an opportunity to discuss NABB\nbusiness after the rest have gone might be profitable.\nI therefore plan to stay wherever Ed puts me the\nevening of the 7th, and at Alurani Hall the evening of\nthe 8th. I’ll ride in to Birmingham with you the\nrooming of the 9th, and we con then decide where I\ncan most usefully to you all spend the rest of the\nday, the 9th.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSscb\ncci Raymond Ifurlbert\nEd Wegener"
