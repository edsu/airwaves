Her pilot was Lt. Robert\nKline, 26, of Indiana, Pennsylvania, and the flight was made in one of the\nContinental Air Defense Command's Lockheed-built F-94C \"Starfire\" jet\nfighter-inte rceptors.\n\"Knowing that the Air Force had invested about $100, 000 in training\nLieutenant Kline to fly, \" she said, \"I felt I was a lot safer with him at super¬\nsonic speeds than I am in my own neighborhood at home where the kids are\nloose in hotrods and learning to drive by accident. I wanted to get across\nto all women that the Air Force leaves nothing to chance and takes no\nchances--not with its people, not with the citizens of this country, nor with\nour prospects of a safe and secure national future, \"\nThe time she made her flight, the day before Mother's Day in 1956, the\nmost button-bur sting news for her came when she heard a newscaster on a\nrival station in Cincinnati say;\n\"DelVina gave mothers their most unusual mother's day present this\nyear--the present of reassurance. \"\nAnd that-- said DelVina—is exactly why she did it."
