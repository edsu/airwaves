  "text": "PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT\nEducational broadcasting is fast becoming a profession. Several hundred educators and\nstation staff personnel, from Directors and Managers to engineers and writers, have already\nbeen given significant professional upgrading through NAEB Scholarships, workshops,\nSeminars and on-the-spot consultation assistance. Qualified individuals, each at his local\nlevel, can do more for education through these new tools than any number of organizations\nas such. Because of the growing importance and magnitude of this development, the NAEB\npfpfessional Advancement Committee, following the advice of various distinguished con¬\nsultants, beginning with Professor Harold Las swell at the NAEB national convention some six\nyears ago, have called to the appointment of a Director of Professional Advancement to\ncoordinate the many up-grading and training activities which the NAEB is called upon to handle.\nThis step is essential to insure that the educational broadcasting profession is first of all\na part of the educational profession.\nThe coordinator requested would work out Joint projects with other professloaal asso¬\nciations . He would work towards the creation of increasingly high professional standards\nto educational stations and their staffs, codes of operation,aid principles of social\nresponsibility which, we believe could well eventually affect the entire commercial broad¬\ncasting industry as well. In such efforts, the cooperation and experience of all other interested\norganizations would be solicited and used. The NAEB's present Organizational liaison\n(Advisory) Committee will be further developed In this connection.\nThe budget listed below includes $00,000 per year to seminars, workshops, grants-tn-\naid, and scholarships not separately budgeted to in the other requests listed above ."
