So that, typically, the T.V. viewer\nis conditioned to expect much activity and to expect knowledge to\nbe a kind of total revelation or illumination from within both\nsubject and himself. As Dr. Ruhe of the Kansas City Medical Center\npointed cut, T.V. in medical instruction has shown (a) that the\nspeaker, instructor, or* lecturer must efface himself, and (b) that\nthe viewer, in operations for example, was less a spectator than\nthe scalpel. The viewer does not so much see as do the operation.\nEven the surgeon watching the monitor while actually performing\nthe operation frequently is surprised by aspects of the operation\nwhich the T.7. camera picks up beyond his immediate visual range.\nOr rather the operation is translated into another* medium, and so\nrevealed in another mode, much as the newspaper translates our\nordinary social and political lives Into a special mode, providing\nquite new dimensions and meanings for them.\nLet us say, then, that T.V., like radio, states much less\nthan it suggests.
