Manager\nAugust 22, 1968\nDear Ken:\nYour reports on programing for the disadvantaged_\nhave been an excellent device to keep us all informed\nas to what has been happening in this vital area,__and_\nalthough WETA is one of the heaviest committed stations\nin this program area, we find your information most\nuseful.\nIncluded in your 7th report was a reprint from.\nTelevision Magazine which was certainly a fine capsule\nstudy of the activity in .this area*as well. However,\nwhile we're dealing with prejudice, it seems the\nprejudice we feel in ETV ffom Broadcasting and Television\nMagazine borders on the irresponsible. The program\nhours devoted to the disadvantaged in ETV far out¬\nstrips commercial television's contribution and yet\nthis publisher chooses not to recognize a whole spectrum\nof the American’broadcasting industry. I would hope\nyou might find the occasion to call this to Sol Taishoff's\nattention, for it is he,and he alone,who has made this\ndecision.\nPerhaps more important for the present, and on\nbehalf of our staff, may I welcome you to public tele¬\nvision in the Nation's Capital and invite you to come\nsee us at your first opportunity. You might like to see\nour\"Jobs 26\" project up close. I am going to take a few\ndays off beginning tomorrow. When I return. I'll give\nyou a call and see if we can get to lunch.\nWith kind regards.\nWilliam J. McCarter\nTHE GREATER WASHINGTON EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED"
