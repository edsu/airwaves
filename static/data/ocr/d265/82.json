Royalties go to authors.\nJeffersonian Heritage script done on television\nbelongs to the Center.\nWays of Mankind: NAEB owns radio, ET, TV, and film rights.\nWe are giving TV and film rights to the Center.\nPeople under Communism: Same as Jeffersonian Heritage.\nVoices of Europe; We own all rights. Glad to transfer to Center."
