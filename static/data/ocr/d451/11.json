Tettemer\nGeneral Manager\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter and estimate from Earl Miller.\nI have gone over the estimates and think they are very fair,\nand it appears to me that he has included everything required.\nFrom these I would suggest that we consider the color film.\nOf course, there is the one drawback. When we use color\nfor the film we really should use black and white for the\ntelevision examples. This will make a startling contrast\nand serve to point up this deficiency in television. I per¬\nsonally think it will be many, many years before color tele¬\nvision is used in schools.\nCan we now go ahead and write a contract with Earl and one\nwith Marye? As soon as we can get a contract I would like\nto go down to Texas and spend a day or so going over the\nplans with Marye and Earl just to be sure we all are in agree¬\nment as to what will be done and in what order.\nLet me know if I can do anything more to help get the contracts\nwritten.\nSincerely,\npAIR R.
