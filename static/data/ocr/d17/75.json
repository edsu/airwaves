I find that he was kind enough to send\nme a copy of his original note to you. I want to congratulate you on putting\nthis through. I think NAEB's membership in the European Broadcasting\nUnion, even if only on an associate basis, will add materially to our\nprestige abroad and at the same time provide a source of valuable materials.\nI realize that we'll still have to worry about additional payments, but I think\nwe ought to be able to cross that bridge when we come to it.\nL\n,\nIn view of the fact that Schooley may be away on vacation, I am\nsending to you herewith the draft of the Agenda for the General Assembly of\nthe Prix Italia in Rimini beginning September 11th. If you have any suggestions\nor ideas which might be of particular interest to us for any added items, please\nlet me know at your early convenience so that this can be added and taken up by\nthe Assembly.\nI expect to get a note off to you very shortly concerning the entries\nwhich we are sending to Rimini for this year's Prix Italia. At the moment\nthere is still some uncertainty about my going personally because there appears\nto be a lack of travel funds. If this situation cannot be corrected, I think we may\nhave Bernie Buck represent us on the General Assembly as well as on the Jury.\nI will keep you informed.\nSNS / cb\nEnc.\nWith all best wishes, believe me\nially^rour s,\nSeymour N. Siegel\nDirector\nV"
