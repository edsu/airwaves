Skornia, NAEB Executive Director, served as chairman for this\n’’clean-up” session. The program consisted principally of questions and comments\nwhich members wished to express. Travel voucher instructions and many other\ndetails were included.\nDr. Skornia noted that the conference, perhaps, devoted an undue proportion\nof time to TV, but the delegates seemed to be interested in TV. The backbone of\nthe Organization, however, he recalled with some of the radio members, is the radio\nmembership.\nDr. Skornia then distributed announcements of the 1955-56 Grants-in-Aid,\npointing out that this is the fourth series of such grants made possible by the\nFAE and the ETRC. The meeting was then opened to questions*\nQuestion: Will we all get a list of all those attending this conference?\nSkornia: That will be taken care of in the complete minutes of the meeting.\nI would like to say that the manner in which your Committee picked up this regional\nmeeting after earlier plans were cancelled was wonderful."
