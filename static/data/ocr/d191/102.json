His network fee is still the same.\nIP the network were to establish a maximum number of selections\nallowed any one station, it would be possible for him to include\nthe in-school tapes in his quota without paying extra for the same.\nAs a result, the station would be able to serve in areas where itâ€™s\nneeded, without \"getting something for nothing\".\nI've finally got it off my chestJ You can have it for what it's\nworth.\nVery sincerely yours\nDUQUESNE UNIVERSITY\n'B.
