Mary Somerville I join Monday, and for almost three\nhours today I looked over their library—an excellent reference\nsource for me which I intend to haunt for many an hour.\nIpve also made contact with the powers that-be at the university\nof London—the director of the Inst itute of Edueaiai, and the\nman who is my fecial liaison person. (I am formally a Ful-\nbrighfc Feikikow at the U of London, not at the BBC, although\nthat will not impose any restrictions on me whatsoever.)\nxhen too, I'm ngotiating to get a TV-radio receiver ofwhich I\nhave none. And if I can't get the Fulbright funds for that—\nthe subject of a coifterence set up for Monday—I'llbe on NAEB's\ntreasury for rental money.\nI r egret that my housing took so much time, but everything is\ngoing well now. So, here goes for a few questions:\nWk t is the currents tate of our BBC negotiations. I hare he¬\nft re me your repcr t to the Board of July 20 on your European\ntrip, plus the letter from Greene to you of July 10. How d> we\nstand on this? Are we giving them 66,000, and if so, from what\nsource?\nAny ideas on contacts you wait me t<make, or things to do? If so,\nlet me fcar from you. Now tost a* tanother letter—I haven't written\none for two weeks to anybody except notes to the fan ily. A carbon\nf this g> es to Harry, and a carbon of my now-to-be-written letter\nto him, goes to you.\nMy best to you and to all my NAEB friends. Let me hear from\nyou]\nlours a ncerely,\nBurton Paulu"
