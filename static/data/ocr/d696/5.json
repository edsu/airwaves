Let me give you a few\nnotes on what I see and feel and then you can see\nwhy I*m taking so much time In answering.\nA. NAEB Image - This is the worst problem for\nus. Let me give you the present picture as I see\nit;\nApril n, I960\n1. NETRC has become a focal point for\nETV stations. it holds one managers meeting per\nyear, one program directors meeting per year, and\nthis year It is holding an engineering meeting.\nSince many of the critical developments of ETV\nare decided in these meetings they are most\nsignificant for ETV. However, it is obvious the\nCenter holds an image of ETV stations and the\nnetwork office.\nAnother aspect is that of professional advance¬\nment. With an excellent station relations depart¬\nment, engineering area, and much \"Inside channels\"\ninformation exchanged, the Center does a very good\njob of professional advancement for those now\naffiliated with It. It Is disturbing to see the\nbreach in information widening between ETV station\nand NAEB non-station personnel, but it is happening\neveryday and will be a critical issue quite soon.\nI don*t believe it is the Center taking over an\nNAEB Job, its Just that the Center In its services\nto Its members has the funds and the know how to do\nan excellent Job."
