They were anxious to be well\nthought of. But pride can lead to suspicion and this in turn to quarrels.\nThe Yurok took no insult lightly, were not a peaceful people. Nor could\nthey live up to the strict rules of conduct their culture demanded. Sins\nwere committed.\nSo all was tense during the ceremonies of World Renewal, as radio\nlisteners will learn from this description of one. All was tense in the\nremembrance of hatreds and sins that made the ceremony necessary, tense\nin the rivalry that existed in the display of wealth by the rich, tense in the\nfear that some fresh outbreak might prevent the purpose of the dance.\nTo the radio listener will be pointed out that perhaps these early\npeople, primitive though they were, had a glimpse of the truth. For preservfcig\nthe ritual meant successful cooperation and the resolution of conflicts. This\nindeed might be an eternal secret, for all time and ages, of World Renewal."
