Two programs per week are considered the maximum.\nIt is sometimes a problem to get teachers to choose appropriate broad¬\ncasts for their grade levels.\nC) It is deplorable to use the broadcast time to check records or do other\nclerical work. Teacher participation is just as important as student\nparticipation. Accordingly, script-writers often seek to include the\nteacher by using such devices as asking her to repeat a line or to write\nsomething on the board.\nMiss McCance also pointed out that she felt school broadcasts are made more\neffective by the inclusion of some form of audience participation. This is par¬\nticularly true up to junior high school grades. Provincial school broadcast\ndepartments frequently supply supplementary aids—e.g. mimeographed maps for stu¬\ndents to follow when listening to a social studies broadcast involving the jour¬\nney of an explorer, song sheets for pupils to follow on the music broadcasts,\nscripts to follow during the French language broadcasts.\nIn response to a question about the methods used in Canada to determine\nwhat subjects should be covered for a following year. Miss McCance explained that\nany or all of the following might be used:\n1) Try to ascertain the needs by general questionnaires to teachers.\n2) Secure suggestions from radio committees.\n3) Secure suggestions from key teachers. (Especially selected teachers\nwho have expressed their willingness to have their classes used as\nspecial listening posts. Reports from these teachers are given spe¬\ncial consideration).\nIn the selection of topics it is important to keep in mind those subjects\nwhich are best suited to the medium of radio."
