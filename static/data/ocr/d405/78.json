We are further\nagreed that trying to originate programming concepts, specific areas\nfor programs, and specific programs to fit the areas for a network is\nnot a Job to be undertaken by three people in Iowa City, New York, and\nKnoxville. Programming by committee is a big fat headache, of course,\neven if the committee can get together; it’s nearly impossible when the\ncommittee doesn’t meet0\nWright attended a meeting in Chicago with Chairmen of the\nGrant-in-Aid, Acceptance, and In-School Acceptance Committees, along with\nSkornia and Bob Hudson to discuss this year’s grant in aid program. The\nmaster title of AMERICA IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY for the grant applicants\nwas suggested by Wright, so this committee can claim credit for originat¬\ning it.\nWright has also submitted a monthly radio program Idea as per\nSchooley’s suggestion for the NAEB News-Letter for about three or four\nmonths now. This will continue, since suggestions are being received\nfrom members.\nRADIO NETWORK COMMITTEE\nThe chairman of the Joint Committee has successfully acted with\ndiligence and efficiency to evade any mental or physical exertion.\nWaldo Abbot, Chairman\nNetwork Acceptance Committee"
