Certain of the details, however, are drawn\nfrom observations that he made elsewhere.

As the text suggests, he doubted if the ills of France would be\ncured, even if idle lands were distributed to the landless, and he pointed out\nthat misery seemed to be an accompaniment of a dense population. This was before\nthe pronouncement of the Malthusian Doctrine, which it partly anticipated. It\nmay not have been true with respect to France at that time, but it has definite\nbearing on the plight of overpopulated regions in Asia and elsewhere today. In\nmany of these regions the ratio of land to people would be very low even though\nthere were an equitable distribution. Also, the lack of distress in the United\nStates then and later could be attributed very considerably to the highly favor¬\nable ratio between its physical resources and its population.\nFor dramatic purposes Jefferson's fight against entails and primogeniture in\nVirginia has been telescoped somewhat and thrown chiefly into an exchange of argu-\nExperimental Discussion Program Subject to Revision\n31"
