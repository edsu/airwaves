  "text": "October 17* 1952\nPage 2\nhad indicated his interest in being considered for this job* I\nfeel that I should pass on to this group a strictly confidential\nstatement made to me personally by one of the top administrators\nat the University of Texas concerning the charges against Tom,\nbut I cannot do so in writing nor can I reveal the name of the\nperson involved in writing* He did indicate, however, that the\ncharges brought against Tom were true and that the explanation\nbeing given by Tom and some of his most loyal supporters was a\ncamouflage* I think ell of you know that for many years I have\nbeen a very warm friend of Tom’s and a most loyal supporter of\nhim and that I have refused to believe any of the stories that\nI have heard circulated about the reasons fcr his le aving Texas*\nIn light of the complicating testimony and my own personal\nevaluation of Tfam, I have no further comment to male . Nevertheless,\nI feel that we should proceed with tracing some of the references\nTom has given us and am enclosing in this letter to Allen a list\nof references which Tom gave me with the request that he male an\nimmediate check on them and come up with jflfe>specific recommendation\nto this committee at a later date* I will institute a similar iiw\nvestigation on Gail Adkins*\nTime is very short but I wonder if Frank Schooley, Seymour\nSiegel and I might arrange a flying trip to North Carolina to talk\nto barl Friday, October 2U, or invite him to meet us in some place\nsuch as Chicago on that date* I could arrange to be there Friday\nafternoon and Friday evening and fly home Saturday morning* Perhaps\nBurton could meet us if we could all meet in some central location\nsuch as Chicago so he would lose only one day* It would be wise\nfar Si, Frame, and Burton to give me a wire or call concerning this\npossibility as soon as you have received this letter* Vftmn has\nindicated that he will be in Urbana November 6, 7, and 8 but cannot\nbe there earlier* A meeting with him prior to the Minneapolis\nmeeting will give him some time to make a positive decision which\nhe could relay to us at the convention*\nAnother alternative to this would be to make T«fynn a\nwritten offer at this time <f the jobo I would suggest if we do\nthat that we make him a top offer of $12,000 a year for four years\nwith the understanding that the contract must be for that full\nperiod but subject to review by the Board at the end of the\nfirst year*\nPlease let me hear from you as soon as humanly possible*\nThere is great urgency in settling this matter*\nSincerely yours $\nGAspse"
