Wladimir Selinsky has provided an eminently helpful score-..and Frank Rapp8s\ndirection is plain and knowing.” {Jack Gould, New York Times, Sept, 15, 19-2)\n\"The Jeffersonian Heritage” is a 13-week half-hour series dealing with the life,\ntimes, principles and philosophy of Thomas Jefferson* However, its purpose is not\nbiographical, but rather to show how Jeffersonian ideals have guided generations of\nAmerican statesment up to the present day. In line with this aid, the initial pro¬\ngram, 8The Living Declaration,5 reviewed, spotlighted Jefferson3 s part in writing of\nDeclaration of Independence.\n\"The entire ©ries is based on the research, writing and advice of Professor\nDumas Malone, of Columbia University.....Producer-director, Frank Papp, has show¬\ncased the professor’s material in laudable fashion, with Wladirair Selinsky3s majes¬\ntic background music particularly impressive. However, major credit for the series5\nsuccess belongs to actor Claude Bains..*..\n\"The first show in the series registered maximum audience impact, via Jeffer¬\nson’s vain attempt to have an anti-slavery clause written in. the Constitution and\nReinA9 convincing explanation of Jefferson’s tolerant religious views.\"\n(June Bundy, Billboard, Sept. 20, 1952)\n\"Radio’s evaluation of Thomas Jefferson’s contributions to the free world—the\nhighly touted series produced by the Rational Assn* of Educational Broadcasters un¬\nder a grant from the Ford Foundation—got away to an impressive start (-Sunday, 3apt.\n14), to suggest that this scries will have steady, and sharpened impact.\n\"A little pretentious and self-conscious in its scripting at the very start,\nthe premiere program got into proper dramatic focus very soon, however, by virtue\nof its subject matter and Claude Rains* fine performance os Jefferson. The meat\nand sincerity in this program, the easy though serious way in which it was presented\nas veil as the sterling quality of the acting performances, type this as a highly\nimportant series* It should be hmist1 listening for adults as well as all schoolrooms\n\"Program was a combined, narration-dramatization format, which had drama, bite,\nand vigor.\" (Variety, Sept. 17, 1952)\n\"The NAEB should be mighty proud of the job producer Frank Papp and his staff\ndid on their 1Jeffersonian Heritage8 series. The quality of production and script\nare radio at its almost forgotten best—reminiscent of the glorious days of the\nold Columbia Workshop....\" (Ted Green, Radio Daily, Oct. 21, 1952)"
