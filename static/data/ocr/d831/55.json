He had recommended Siegel* and hadn’t expected\nto be invited in any case • Either one of them will come for the whole time ^\nor they will both come at different times.\nHowever* to plan who comes when* can you send him a urogram as scon as\npossible so each can come for that part most nearly in his interest* one at\na time?\nThis removes part of the squeeze* and since they’re so close to Columbus*\ntransportation won’t be a large item • I’ve left both on the list which* un*\nfortunately* was prepared before X got to talk with him.\nRegards*\nHJS:jg\nCC: Members* Research Committee\nNOTE TO: Research Committee Members: Following a ”8tr<mg pitch” by\nBob Schenkkan on behalf of Professor Moore* who wasn’t there when he\nsent in his earlier nomination* afoer careful consideration ! added him\nafter the other apjMroved alternates. I did not feel ttmt X could put him\nhigher <m the list* under the circumstances* though he might have been if\nwe’d heard earlier.\nHTS"
