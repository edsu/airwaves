This evidence came from the small sociometric invest*\nigation which was carried out on changes in group structure following\nthe introduction of instructional television. Quite interesting.\nWould love to have you come down. As 1 indicated above, this is not a\nvery good month. Would it be possible for you to make it sometime in\nApril? What are the possible dates for you? Let me know also how long\nyou want to stay, so that 1 can plan accordingly. If I can work it out\nhere, and it is agreeable to you, I would like to have you speak. Let\nme know what sort of arrangements need to be made to induce you to speak\n(financial, etc.), and 1 will see what can be done.\nI spoke in Atlantic City a week or so ago at the national meeting of\nschool administrators and they are certainly worked up about television.\nInteresting, for I have known some of these people for a long time and\nmany of them who are now tremendously excited would not have considered\nfilm or radio as of much importance for education. I believe too that\nwe are still far from the crest of the interest wave.\nLooking forward to seeing you one of these days.\nBest,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLBsks\ncc: Harry Skornia"
