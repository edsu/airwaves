  "text": "The first concrete step in the history of the NAEB\nTape Network was taken in January of 1950 when Seymour N.\nSiegel offered to some of the member stations a program\nentitled, WE HUMAN BEINGS, produced by the Lowell Institute\nCooperative Broadcasting Council. You know, from the\nprevious report, to what extent this embryonic network grew\nin its first year of life. The over-worked staff of WNYC\nsaw this infant develop into a Gargantua. It was inevitable\nthat there should also develop problems of Gargantuan propor¬\ntions 0 Yes, there were many bugs in the operation, With each\nnew program and with each new station the problems multiplied.\nBut! There was an educational network operating! The idea\nwas basically sound, and the problems could be solved.\nOn January 15, 19515 the headquarters of the network\nwas moved to the University of Illinois, much to the relief\nof the V/NYC staff. In its new home the network claimed the\nattention of people who were at least less over-worked. There\nlikewise were available some facilities with which, it was\nhoped, improvements might be possible. But, many of the problems\nremained. There were serious shortages of time, money, personnel,\ntapes, equipment, etc. Some improvements were possible, and these\nwill be discussed later in the report. The basic problems,\nhowever, remain unsolved®\nThis, then, is no glowing report of miraculous achievement.\nRather it is an accounting of an interim period between the\ngallant labor pains of the WNYC staff that brought the network\ninto being and the day when genuine achievement would be possible.\nThat day now seems assured for the very near future®\nWhat follows will give an accounting of what has taken\nplace since the first report was submitted. It will define some\nof the problems as seen from the position of network headquarters,\nand will also propose some suggestions for a more efficient\noperation."
