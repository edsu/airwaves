We need your thinking\nvery badly because you have been in the organization a\nlong time and have worked as hard as any broadcaster in\nthe country.\nOn a page completely apart from your reactions to\nthe enclosed questions, I should like to have your suggestions\nfor a Committee of Three, including myself. I shall not put\nyour name on the Committee for the simple reason that\nsomebody might say the University of Illinois would swing too\nmuch influence. I shall expect to confer with you, as well\nas Schramm and the Foundation, however, and certainly want\nyour best thinking as we go along. We will, of course,\nmeet on your campus for this Committee meeting. It goes\nwithout saying that your suggestions for the Committee will\nbe kept confidential.\nPlease let me have your reactions by return\nairmail.\nSincerely yours,\n/s/ Graydon\nGraydon Ausmus, Director\nRadio Broadcasting Services\nVice-President, NAEB\nGA/ms"
