Just as each\nscript should build to a conclusion, so the entire series should reach\na final conclusion.\n2) There is need for a differentiation between accuracy and truth.\nIf the writer is going to be completely accurate about the Gettysburg\naddress and the way in which Lincoln delivered it, he may well miss\nthe truth of the words and the greatness of the ideas. In talking\nto children, we often get accuracy and lose the truth. It is impor¬\ntant not to overlook the picture of a man, an idea, a truth, or an\nera, in our eagerness to set down a number of facts.\nIn planning an individual program, Miss Girling offered the following sug¬\ngestions:\n1) Don*t plan to talk down to children, to simplify beyond effectiveness.\nHave a healthy respect for children and their ability to comprehend.\n2) Work with conflict, but make it situation conflict, not personality\nconflict, for several reasons. Situation conflict is more objective.\nWhen personality conflict must be used to get the point across, be\nsure to motivate it and justify it. But keep in mind always that\npersonality conflicts provide risky, touchy ground, because the child* s\nown world may be far more receptive to conflict than we know. Give\nthe young listeners decency, honesty, kindness.\n3) The format of a script should be determined by its subject matter.\nThe beginning writer tends to rely on drama, truly a fine art and an\neffective medium, but there are other ways of being highly interesting."
