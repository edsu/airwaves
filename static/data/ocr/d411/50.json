Becker\nChairmen, NAEB Research Committee\nDivision of Television, Radio, FM\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nWhat do you think of this? I wonder if the NAEB should join in this,\nwith you delegated as our representative? It would keep our hand in.\nSince he was the only person we had on the spot, in Paris, at the\ntime, John Meaney represented us at this meeting. I think I sent you\na copy of an earlier note on this. Not sure he was greatly impressed,\nbut I'd think this has possibilities. But I’ll “quit pushin’\" and let\nyou make up your own mind, and decide what we might do.\nThanks for your excellent telephoned suggestions of yesterday.\nAnnual total is now $87,700.00 including $15,000.00 for annual studies,\nonly $10,000.00 for Seminars and Workshops, and $20,000.00 Grants\nin aid. Have listed coordinator (16,500.00: $15,000.00 and 10% re¬\ntirement etc.) and assistant, ($7,000.00 and 10%) with $4,000.00\ntravel. Your suggestions,now incorporated, have strengthened the\nwhole request.\nSee copies of only 3 letters received to date on Nielsen proposal. I\nwonder if we should now wait for their next year's study. I'll wait\nfor all replies, of course, but thought you might like to see these.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. £>xornia\nExecutive Director\nHJS:jg\nCC: Burton Paulu\nEnclosures/JReport from International Association for\nMass Communication Research\nXJ Copies ofSchooley, Stone and Hunter\n^ letters on Nielsen Report.)"
