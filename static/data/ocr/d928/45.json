One master amplifier and bias\noscillator feed all the individual\nslaves. Once the proper duplicating\nlevel is established, the only addi¬\ntional checking procedure necessary\nis the playing of a portion of one\ntape from the last run. If it is “per¬\nfect” all duplicates from all slaves\nwill be equally satisfactory.\nAmpex Tape Duplicators use major\ncomponents similar to those in the\nfamiliar Ampex Series 300 Record¬\ners. They have been tested and\nproved by thousands of hours of\nsuccessful commercial operation.\nAmpex reduces the cost of tape du¬\nplication to a fraction of previous\nlevels. There are five key factors:\n(1) low set-up time, (2) high dupli¬\ncating speed, (3) simultaneous use\nof ten slave recorders, (4) simplified\nquality control procedure and (5)\nthe traditionally long life of Ampex\nequipment.\nThese advantages are equally ap¬\nplicable whether duplicates are\nneeded in mass production quanti¬\nties or only one or two at a time. In\nthe latter case, the master and one\nslave would be used but the high\nrunning speed would have the same\nlabor-saving advantages.\nFigures listed are ratios of playing time to duplicating time.\nTAPE SPEEDS\nAND TRACKS\nSTANDARD\n7y2/15 IN/SEC.\nRECORDER*\nTAPE DU\nWITH\nONE SLAVE\nPLICATOR\nWITH\nTEN SLAVES\n33/4 IPS.\nDOUBLE TRACK\n2/1\n32/1\n320/1\n33/4 IPS.\nSINGLE TRACK\n2/1\n16/1\n160/1\n73/2 IPS.\nDOUBLE TRACK\n1/1\n16/1\n160/1\n71/2 IPS.\nSINGLE TRACK\n1/1\n8/1\n80/1\n15 IPS.\nDOUBLE TRACK\n1/1\n8/1\n80/1\n15 IPS.\nSINGLE TRACK\n1/1\n4/1\n40/1\n* Standard recorders can duplicate 33A in/sec. tapes at IVz\nin/sec., but cannot duplicate 33^ or 7'/2 in/sec. tapes at 15\nin/sec. except with extensive changes in equalization circuitry.\nLOW COST DUPLICATION OFFERS NEW OPPORTUNITIES...\nRADIO\nTape networks now become prac¬\ntical supplements or alternatives\nto line networks. For example,\nprograms of national interest can\nbe recorded, duplicated and dis¬\ntributed in taped form to all net¬\nwork stations. Also, stock musical\nand dramatic program material\nof any length can be economi¬\ncally duplicated and distributed\nto hundreds of stations on a lease\nor subscription basis.\nBACKGROUND MUSIC\nBackground music services, tran¬\nscription services and recording\ncompanies can now profitably\nproduce background music tapes.\nUsers of such machines as the\nAmpex 450 Tape Reproducer,\nwhich plays 8 full hours of music\nwithout repetition, will benefit\nfrom the availability of a wider\nmusic selection.\nRECORD MANUFACTURE\nThe growing demand for high fi¬\ndelity music can be met success¬\nfully with economical tape dupli¬\ncation. Tape recordings can now\nbe manufactured to compete fa¬\nvorably with LP records in the\nretail market.\nSELLING\nCompanies of national scope can\nduplicate, and distribute to their\nsales agencies, tape recordings\nof sales meetings, talks by sales\nmanagers and a variety of infor¬\nmation which is most effective\nwhen presented orally. Rapid,\nlow cost tape duplication also\npaves the way for the presenta¬\ntion of sales training programs on\na national basis with far greater\neffect and economy than hereto¬\nfore possible.\nEDUCATION\nThe usefulness of tape and record\nlibraries of school systems is in¬\ncreased enormously by tape du¬\nplication. More rapid and wide¬\nspread distribution of duplicate\ntape and greatly expanded sub¬\nject-matter coverage is now made\npossible.\nLIBRARIES FOR THE BLIND\nBooks, magazines, music and\ndrama can be read or played\nonto tape and duplicated in\nwhatever number is needed. Thus,\nit becomes feasible to maintain\nlarge circulating libraries of\ntapes as a practical means of en¬\ntertainment and education for\nthe blind.\n3"
