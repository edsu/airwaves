Skornia\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1U Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI have before me from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,\nthe first and second CBC Halifax-Dartmouth studies which are\n4- titled \"Radio Listening Patterns in a Canadian Communication . . .\n\"before\" Television.\"\nMay I suggest you write to B. K. 3yram, Supervisor of\nAnalysis and Reports, Audience Research Division, CBC, P. 0*\nBox 806, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada for a copy for the NAEB head¬\nquarters library.\nI notice the Audience Studies Section of the Fact Sheet\nService is mighty thin and it is my opinion that some kind of\nreport on these two important studies should be made. I will\nbe glad to attempt a summary if you want me to.\nIncidentally, when you write Byram, inquire about the confi¬\ndential classification which appears on Part I of the study only.\nThis might affect what could be reported. My guess is that\nseveral non-CBC stations were mentioned by name. Naturally our\nreport would not need to identify particular stations in this\nmanner.\nMy audience study of Lansing has been completed and is\nnow awaiting duplication for distribution. I have the head¬\nquarters included in the folder of requests for copies of same.\nSincerely,\nIrving R. Merrill\nDirector of Television Research,WKAR\nIRMsvaz"
