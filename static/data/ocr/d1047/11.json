Hill, Administrative Vice President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Harold:\nI have just received the ballot for the election of an\nindividual member director, which I am returning under separate\ncover.\nThe length of this ballot brings immediately to mind the\nquestion: isn*t this getting a little out of hand? There are\nso many nominations — as a matter of fact quite a number of\ngood ones — that how can anyone expect to receive a plurality\nof the votes in less than six ballotings?\nDo you have any bright ideas as to how the number of\nnominations could be held down to some more manageable number?\nYours sincerely\nBurton Paulu, Director\nRadio and Television\nBP/sk"
