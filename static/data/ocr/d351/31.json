I.e., the Russians have a strong and\neffective program in the development of their educational system.\nThey are using their schools and the minds of their young people as\ninstruments of war. Generally, the public knows this. The NAEB must\nbe the antithesis of the Russian system, and can catch the imagination\nof the public by stating that it can match or at least assist the\nprogress of education, when it is joined as a supplement to our present\neducational system.\nFourth, it is not enough to tellpeople of the need; they must\nbe asked to participate. The circle of communications demands action,\nand everything and anything coming from the NAEB must contain suggestions\nfor immediate action.\nThe NAEB must conduct itself as a battalion of soldiers by\ncovering each point where it is exposed to the public with an equal\namount of firepower. It is my opinion that the NAEB had done a fairly\ngood job in getting its story out, but that it has not done a good job\nor any job at all in protecting itself from criticism. We must learn\nto dovetail our long range institutional promotion with our program\nof immediate objectives. In order to do this, we must recognize our\npresent critics and make friends out of them. We should conduct a\nprogram of listening posts where teachers can tell us their problems\nand where we can collect information and distribute it for them —\ninformation that would prove to them that we understand their problem.\nWhen they find that we are ready and willing to help them, they will\nthen begin to believe us — especially when we include in this overall\nhelp our own position."
