And experts on the phone any¬\nwhere in the country or world offer answers to some of the\nproblems.\nHaving a heart-to-heart squawk. (At least it gets people\ntalking. First about their problems. And eventually to\neach other.)\n... if we don't start talking to each other, we’ll end up\nshouting. And there's no telling where we'll wind up after\nthat.\"\nNIGHT CALL crosses regional, urban and cultural boundaries.\nIt can reach 4,000,000 to 7,000,000 persons nightly at the present\ntime. It can secure national leadership at the right time to speak\n— to have rumor confronted, to let facts and truth speak in the\nmidst of suspicion and misinformation. NIGHT CALL can be a national\ntown meeting.\nThese are the unique characteristics of NIGHT CALL:\n1. Through new equipment, the series enables points\nof view from all over the nation to be heard.\n2. Issues are current and are discussed live.\n3.
