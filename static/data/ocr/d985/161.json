Skoraia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nlb Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dr. Skornia:\nThe California State Department of Education has authorized the\nTelevision Committee of Chico State College to conduct .an experiment in\nthe teaching of an undergraduate credit course by commercial television\nfacilities. In our experiment we hope to compare both the educational\nresults and the costs involved of both television methods and traditional\nclassrarom methods. We have chosen the required general education psychology\ncourse, so we will have a considerable number of students available for\nthe experiment. Our present schedule calls for planning the experiment\nduring the fall 1957 semester, conducting the experiment during the spring\n1958 semester, and preparing the report of the experiment during the\nsummer and fall of 1958.\nWe would greatly appreciate any material that might be helpful to\nus. We would also appreciate any leads you could give us â€¢ Material\nthat would offer help in the planning of the experiment would be\nespecially appreciated. Although we will be using commercial facilities,\nresearch in the use of closed circuit television should be pertinent to\nour experiment.\nAs committee member in charge of planning the experiment, I would\nappreciate any assistance that you and the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters can give us.\nSincerely yours.\nCRH\nJohn B. Hawley, Ph. D.\nAssociate Professor\nSociology and Education"
