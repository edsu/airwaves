I think I detected a touch of this attitude in your letter when\nyou referred to Galeâ€™s level as being someone less than the ten or twelve\nthousand dollar class. In my judgment, Gale is in this class. For example,\nwhen Tom Rishworth left this spring Gale moved in and carried both his duties\nand Tom's duties with ease.\nI hope the above remarks help you to make the decision concerning replacement\nfor Jim Miles. If you happen to come through Dallas, be sure to give me a\nbuss.\nSincerely yours,\nA. L. Chapman"
