  "text": "The factors that seem to be involved are: Establishment\nof standards for master tapes to be used. Securing the necessary\nequipment and establishing procedures to insure a top quality\ntape from which to duplicate. Duplicating equipment which will\nfaithfully reproduce the master tape. Standardization of head\nalignment, timing, and similar procedures throughout the\nnetwork.\n4. Duplication and distribution. The present form of program\ndistribution is a function of available duplicating equipment.\nAfter a yearâ€™s experience with the bicycling method of\ndistribution in various forms, I can state without hesitation\nthat it is an unworkable system. There does not seem to be\nany possible way to provide dependable delivery under this method.\nThis x lack of dependability results in the stations being\nsomewhat hesitant to schedule network programs to best advantage,\nand more importantly discourages their endeavoring to promote and\npublicize them. For this, theyx can hardly be blamed. It\nalso necessitates a complex and impractical method of scheduling.\nStations do not follow standard pattersn in scheduling programs.\nWhen they are forced to fit into a rigid mailing schedule many\ndifficulties arise.\nClearly, the life of the network depends upon x finding and\nputting into operation a more efficient method of distribution.\n5. Program procurement and approval. Our methods of securing\nprograms are still haph&zxard mostly non-methodical. A direct\nmeans of including station representation in the process does\nnot exist. Many program sources, including cooperative programming"
