He has a certain amount of\ncapital of his own that ho is lending to his **foundation,” the Paduan Founda¬\ntion. He intends to broadcast in an nexpansive and esoteric* maimer.\nFrom tie name of his foundation to the articles of incorporarbion and to his\nexhibits it is all a trivial imitation of KPFA and, having know Milam for\na year and a half, I ifear m will have sensational beatnildsm on the air\nwhich will create a second failure of listener-subscription radio in Wash¬\nington and reflect badly on Pacifica and on educational braodcasting.\nflfcr specific question is» Does the NAEB have any definition of competence\nwith relation to the educational band — either from demonstrated experience\nor from the nature of the institution — or is anyone free to incorporate\nas an educational foundation and attempt to qualify for channels in the\neducational band?\nPlease let me hear as soon as possible.\nCordially,\n/s/ Hal\nHarold Winkler\nPresident\nHWid"
