Kellogg Foundation ^\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nEnclosed are three copies of our financial statement reflecting\nexpenditures for our Headquarters operation, and the relation there¬\nto of the support received from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, for\nthe fiscal year 1961-1962,\nI am also enclosing three copies of our gnnual program report,\nwhich you will notice has an improved format and Includes reports\nfrom our committee chairmen.\nI am sorry for the delay in submitting these reports to you,\nbut, as Harold Hill explained to you on the phone several weeks ago,\nwe changed our time of reporting this year from July to the time of\nthe annual convention. Thus, the program report was prepared for\npresentation to the members last week in Philadelphia.\nAgain, may X express our sincere appreciation for the support\nthe V. K. Kellogg Foundation has given us over the past eleven years.\nI believe evidence that your initial faith in providing for our first\npermanent office and staff is to be found in the fact that our Net¬\nwork operation has been completely self-supporting for the past seven\nyears and the Headquarters operation this year achieved a little better\nthan 70% self-support.\nWe also appreciate your personal Interest and friendliness over\nthe years and we hope that we may continue to call on you for counsel.\nSincerely yours.\nWGH:pw\nEnclosures\nWilliam G. Harley"
