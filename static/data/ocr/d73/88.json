We need, above all, a\nbroad blueprint.\nWe need scientific answers to questions\nwhich are fundamental to the whole purpose\nand process of learning — questions relating\nto the best use of teachers, the best use of\nfacilities, and the most satisfactory curricula.\nWe need a broad plan of approach to bring\ninto being all the good things made possible\nby modern technology — especially closed-\ncircuit TV.
