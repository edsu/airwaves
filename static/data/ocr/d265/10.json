To his interpretation of Jefferson* Mr. Rains is bringing forcefulness leavened\nby humility..,.The Educational Broadcasters have not stinted in other departments\neither. Mladirair Selinsky has provided an eminently helpful score...and Frank Papp*s\ndirection is plain and knowing*\" {Jack Gould* Hew York Times, Sept. 15? 192)\n\"The Jeffersonian Heritage\" is a 13-week half-hour series dealing with the life,\ntimes, principles and philosophy of Thomas ^offorson. However, its purpose is net\nbiographical, but rather to show how Jeffersonian ideals have guided generations of\nAmerican statesment up to the present day.

However, major credit for the series*\nsuccess belongs to actor Claude Rains...*.\n\"The first show in the series registered maximum audience impact, via Jeffer¬\nson’s vain attempt to have an anti-slavery clause written in the Constitution and\nRaind* convincing explanation of Jefferson*3 tolerant religious views.\"\n(June Bundy, Billboard, Sept* 20, 1952)\n“Radio’s evaluation of Thomas Jefferson3s contributions to the free world—the\nhighly touted series produced by the National, Assn, of Educational Broadcasters un¬\nder a grant from the Ford Foundation—got away to an impressive start (Sunday, Sept.\n14), to suggest that this series will have steady, and sharpened impact.\n\"A little pretentious and self-conscious in its scripting at the very start,\nthe premiere program got into proper dramatic focus very soon, however, by virtue\nof its subject matter and Claude Rains1 fine performance as Jefferson. The meat\nand sincerity in this program, the easy though serious way in which it was presented\nas wall as the sterling quality of the acting performances, type this as a highly\nimportant series. It should be ’must1 listening for adults as well as all schoolrooms.\n\"Program was a combined narration-dramatisa lon format, which had drama, bite,\nand vigor.\" (Variety, Sept. 17, 1952)\n\"The HAEB should be mighty proud of the job producer Frank Papp and his staff\ndid on their 1Herfersonian Heritage3 series. The quality of production and script\nare radio at its almost forgotten best—reminiscent of the glorious days of the\nold Columbia Workshop....\" (Ted Green, Radio Daily, Oct. 21, 1952)"
