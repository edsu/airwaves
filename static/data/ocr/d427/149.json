Schooley\nRe: Subscription Television\nlo Should NAEB take a position on subscription television?\nShould it file if and when the Commission requests comments?\nIf you are not familiar with the latest may I suggest you\nread Page 31 of BROADCASTING magazine, dated November 150\nI am making a similar request for opinion of the Engineering\nCommittee, of the Television Development Committee, and of our\nlegal counselo\ncc: Skornia\nI have no definite conviction. I feel that subscription television\nwill benefit the theater type of spectacular and the feature movie\nprograms more than any other. The only way an educational station\nwould profit would be in the case of an outstanding football game\nor similar broadcast.\nI do not believe that many folks will pay to get the school of the\nair or credit course kind of program. Perhaps I do not understand\nthe public but that is my belief.\nI see subscription television as favoring a minority group by\ngiving it a monopoly on a public owned facility. It is the old\nclear channel situation over again. If that is true then perhaps\nNAEB should intervene to protect the future of public education\nby television. It would be on this basis alone that I would\nconsider intervention.\nThese two points of view will have to be weighed against each other\nand the NAEB position determined by which is the stronger."
