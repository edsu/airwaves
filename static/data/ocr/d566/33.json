It is mentioned here to insure that this aspect of the\ntotal problem will receive adequate consideration. It is the crucial\nproblem, as we in network headquarters have observed it.\nPromotion and Publicity\nWoefully little has been done in the way of promotion.\nIt is the fondest hope of the network headquarters that this phase\nof the operation will be vastly implemented with the arrival of\nfunds.\nThere are so many possibilities that only a few will be\nmentioned. As indicated earlier we would like to make greater use\nof the NAEB News-Letter. We would like to send releases to newspapers\nin all of the cities where NAEB stations are located. We would like\nto get some stories in National periodicals. We would like to send\nliterature to schools, listener councils, and other organizations that\nmight be interested in high calibre programming. We have hopes, too,\nof helping the stations in every possible way to promote these programs.\nThis will be easier when the stations can reasonably depend on the\nnetwork schedule.\nAt aay rate, we are hopeful that a great deal can be done\n^Ji^^rs^reau*rtwSHnseem futile indeed to watch this thing grow to\nsignificant proportions and not tell people of its existence."
