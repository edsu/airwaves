Office of the /.EC# Dr. Eric Rogers, Head\nof our Haydies Department, was a member of the group who studied\ncivilian defense for five weeks at Oak Ridge in the spring and he\ntolls me that their final instruetions were to do nothing toward\npublic info,nation on this subject until they were notified by the\nnational office to set up sot:: r of program* I thought this\nprobably would be a good rale ^or me to follow here.\nThe purpose of this letter then is to repeat to you the sug¬\ngestions I made to Mr* Gl&sheen and further to suggest that as Sec¬\nretary-Treasurer of the Alabama Broadcasters Association, I should\nbe happy to work with your organisation in setting up for Alabama ’\nconferences on atomic defense with the broadcasters in this state\nsuch as hav© been planned with the Alabama Press group."
