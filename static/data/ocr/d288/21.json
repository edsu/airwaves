  "text": "PURPOSE OF EXHIBITION\nThe purpose of this exhibition is to further the broadcasting of valuable\neducational programs by calling attention to the most meritorious ones of\neach type.\nEXHIBITORS\nThe Exhibitors are classified into two groups upon the basis of program\nresources. In general these two major classifications are: i. Networks,\nnational organizations, and clear-channel stations; 2. Local and regional\nstations and organizations. The purpose of these two major classifications\nis to promote fairness in judging the programs of an organization with\nlimited resources of budget and personnel in contrast to organizations with\nlarge budgets and personnel. Each entrant should take this into account\nand enter programs in the major classification which most nearly fits the\nconditions. The jury reserves the right to change the classification if, in\nits judgment, such a change will be fairer to other entries. As examples\nof the two major classifications, programs entered by the United States\nOffice of Education would fall in classification 1, as a national organization.\nSo, likewise, would a sustaining educational program entered by Station\nKFI, Los Angeles, a clear-channel station. Programs entered by the Detroit\nPublic Schools, a local organization, or by Station WHA, a regional station,\nwould be entered in classification 2. The exhibit is open to any organi¬\nzation or individual upon payment of an entry fee of fifty cents for each\nprogram entered.\nCLASSES OF PROGRAMS\nIn general, programs submitted must be those whose primary purpose is\nto educate rather than to entertain. Awards will be made for the best of\neach of seven different program types:\nFor General Use:\na. Lecture, talk, speech.\nb. Demonstration or participation program.\nc. Dialog, round-table conversation, interview, debate, question and\nanswer.\nd. All forms of dramatization.\n<« 3 »"
