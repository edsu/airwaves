The participation in public relations activities by Educational ^road-\ncasting Stations is spotty, and ranges from an intense program by some\nstations, to situations 'where there is little or nothing done along\nthese lines.\n2. In general, the community-type stations exhibit more professionalism\nin public relations than the others. The college stations would rank\nsecond. The availability Jtorabney, apparently, is the most important\nfactor in making this situation extant.\nir p\n3* Jhe lack of recognition of the ^rade f.ress as a means of publicizing\nEducational Broadcasting stations1 activities is evident.\n4. Plainly, Educational Broadcasting Stations are not doing their duty by\nthe NAEB publications.\n5* For the most part, processed program schedules are frowned upon by those\nwho must put them out.\n6. Wide discrepancies in the printing costs of program schedules would seem\nto indicate that NAEB could sponsor some helpful research along these\nlines.\n7. This preliminary survey indicates a large area of possible research in\nthe public relations activities of educational broadcasting stations\nthat should be explored on a systematic and scientific basis."
