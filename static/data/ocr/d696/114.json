Photostats of the sketches are attached and I have tried to indicate\nthe color breaks which would be gold finish with a handfired enamel —\nblue, red, green.\nI would seem that it we cculd sell these pins for $1,00 many more of our\nmembers would buy them. This would mean that we would have to order\n500 pins, with plans to sell them over the next two years.\nAny rough design ideas that anyone may come up with are welcome. The\nmike had been suggested as common to both radio and TV but granted that\nit represents the aural side only and riot the visual of the educational\nradio and television industry.\nThe time to kick-off selling these pins, if this idea meets the approval of\nyour committee would be at the 1961 convention in October. To do this,\nhowever, we would have to place an order for the pins no later than Septem¬\nber 13 . I am therefore, taking the liberty of sending copies of this memo\nto your committee members asking them to respond back immediately with\ntheir comments to you so that you can advise us no later than September 14.\nAll the correspondence to the committee has been sent air-mail special\ndelivery.\nMEM/mmm\nend."
