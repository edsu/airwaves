  "text": "December 19, 1968\nMEMORANDUM\nTOi James Fellows\nFROM: Robert Mott\nSUBJECT: Your December 3 Memo on Title III\nThe document provides an excellent background to\nTitle III the Commission*s role, its implications\nfor education, broadcasting and related technology.\nHaving established a perspective and proposed a\nseries of goals (or at least a direction) for the\nCommission, I continue to puzzle over the relation¬\nship of NAEB to the Commission.\nIf, as your memo suggests that group is not doing\nwhat NAEB believes it should, is there an approp¬\nriate action for the Association to take? If so,\nwhy not do so?\nIt seems this document should be distributed as\nyou suggest (with a request for rapid reaction).\nAfter reviewing the comments from the various groups,\na course of action should be formulated and imple¬\nmented by the association staff.\nThe channel of communication between NAEB and the\nCommission should continue unchanged.\nIkl\ncc: William Harley"
