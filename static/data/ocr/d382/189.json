These shoiad\nbe submitted by December or January to enable the ford foundation to\ngive care Ail consideration to it* replacing the more frequent \"servicing”\nneeded for smaller annual grant requests*\nb) If part of this package is not \"bou^t* by ford, we' should go elsewhere\nwith those sections we should still have the “gut3s* to request.
