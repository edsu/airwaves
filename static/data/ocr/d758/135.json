The\nfew modifications that I would suggest, would be more emphasis on\npresentations with some ’’permanency.” The write-ups with a more\ntransient character could be in the Newsletter or the”popular science”\ntype of publication.\nSome of the listings duplicate.\nHope you have a fine New Year.\nCordially yours.\nPhilip Lewis\nDirector\nBureau of Instructional Materials\nPLjmb\nEnclj Questionnaire"
