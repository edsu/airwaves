LOUIS\nDIVISION OF AUDIO-VISUAL EDUCATION\nFROM: Marguerite Fleming ^\nSUBJECT: Answer to proposed increase in NAEB dues.\nIt will be difficult from now on to ask for increases for\nradio in cities in which Boards of Education are being asked to\ncontribute large sums of money for educational television also.\nAlso, we are paying for a great deal of material on the\ntape network that we cannot use. Not too easy to justify the\ncost.\nI really think it could be a dangerous move for us to\nadd much more to our budget at this time."
