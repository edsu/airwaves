Harley\nRadio Hall\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nThanks for having Miss Mcllvane write me. Sorry the resume was\nnot included. I didn*t know about your extended trip to Europe,\nand it is possible that you are on it at the moment. However,\nthis is to let you know that I will start on July 1 as Director\n„of Public Relations and Associate Professor of Journalism at\nWinthrop College, the South Carolina State College for Women,\nat Rock Hill.\nSince I will still be in Region II, is there any need to have\na new director for radio for the balance of the term? I am\nplanning to attend the Seminar in Madison, may bring my family.\nWinthrop has a carrier-current student radio station which I will\nget affiliated with NAEB. Will have to be as an associate until we\nmove into FM....which is part of the plan at present.\nI«m sending the resume along anyhow because the Winthrop College\njob is a compromise. I may want to stay for the rest of my life,\nand I may want to move within a year or so.\nSincerely,\nR<\nDirector\nRF/as\nEnclosure"
