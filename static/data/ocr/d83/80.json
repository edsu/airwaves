Nusbaum,\n116 Lyndhurst Ave.,\nToronto, Ontario,\nCanada.\nJuly 19th, 1960.\nDr. Harold Hill,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nHrbana, Illinois,\nU.S.A.\nDear Dr. Hills\nDuring Project in understanding x*ew Media I asked Prof.\nMcLuhan if he would be good enough to broach several matters to\nyou that were on my mind, as Â± was unable to get any clarification\nfrom him. I must say that he was very reticent to speak on my\nbehalf, and since x am no longer working with him (the project\nhaving concluded) I feel it only right that i should speak on my\nown behalf.\n(1) Exchange on salary cheques (up to 6$ over 10-month\nperiod)\n(2) Salary cut after acceptance of position\n(3) Salary in lieu of vacation\nNumber 4, following, occurred at the end of tne project.\nDecau$e of Prof. McLuhan*s apparent rigidity I saw no point in\ndiscussing it with him:\n(4) Overtime (1-week after June 30th, 1960.)\n(1) Loss on salary\nI would like to point out that these matters were not afterthoughts.\nProf. McLuhan could not (and later would not^ clarify many points\nin Sept. 1959, more or less pointing out that we could cross the\nbridges as we came to them. After my first cheque in September\nI asked Prof. McLuhan if something could be done concerning the\nloss on exchange. The following were the monthly deductions ranging\nup to 6$:\nSept. (2-weeks)\n$11.50\nOct.\n22.28\nNov.\n20.69\nDec.\n19.94\nJan.\n19.72\nFeb.\n21.66\nMarch\n20.50\nApril\n17.85\nMay\n28.33\nJune\n27.22\n$209.69"
