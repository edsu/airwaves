Smith, WMQA, University of Massachusetts.\nAfter brief orientation by the chairman, questions from the floor were invitee.:\nQuestion: How is the appeal in Pittsburgh coming after 2 years?\nDaniel: Not very well. After we went on the air, it’s been hard to get sub¬\nscriptions due to our administrative arrangements, so a good many gimmicks have\nbeen used.\nWheatley: In Boston, the Citizen’s Committee raised dollars, but these are not\nactually community service funds as such. We make use of grants of aid from\nbusinesses to finance particular series of programs. Experimentally this may be\ndone for other series as well. However, all dollars for construction are private\nfunds.\nQuestion: Dollars from an institution?\nWheatley: Not directly, but there are some contributions in either dollars\nor manpower for assistance. It doesn’t bear up strictly as institutional under\nanalysis.\nQuestion: After the initial investment, what do you estimate will be the run¬\nning expenses for Channel 2?\nGunn: At first, it will be about $300,000 for radio and TV, and then, we don’t\nknow.\nQuestion: What will be your telecasting schedule?\nGunn: It will be an eight hour day, five days a week. Right now we’ll be\nable to do at least a four hour day with possibly more later on. This would use\none crew.\nQuestion: In ETV, there is a great deal of use of students to cut costs. Will\norganized labor groups oppose this? Will labor step in?"
