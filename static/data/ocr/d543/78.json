Harley\nPresident, NAEB\nUniversity of Wisconsin\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill:\nThanks for your personal newsletter. The same mail brought\na letter from John expressing his disappointment over the majority\ndecision of the Board. Is it possible to gather accurate details\nat this time about the status of Continental Classroom? One hears\nso many conflicting reports. Except for the first ones growing out\nof the ACE meetings, I have heard nothing to suggest that the proj¬\nect is meeting with overwhelming success. If there was sufficient\ndocumentation to reveal the present state of affairs, I think we\nare still in a position to exhibit the kind of leadership that John\ncries for.\nFranklin Dunham is just back from a summer of teaching at USC.\nHe tells me that Edwin T. Adkins, representing Continental Classroom\nand the AACTE, received a cool response from the large universities\nin Los Angeles that he was trying to enlist. The degree as to whether\nthis is typical or not would be valuable information to have. Are any\nof your blookhounds trained to track down details of this nature be¬\nfore our meeting here in September?\nBe sure to look in on us when you come house hunting in\nWashington. There isn’t any doubt about the increase in operating\ncosts in this expensive city, but if there is any possible way to\nmanage it, I think we ought to give the move very serious consideration.\nBest wishes always. r\nCordially.\n(Mrs.) Gertrude G. Broderick\nRadio-TV Education Specialist"
