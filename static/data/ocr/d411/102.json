Greer\nSupervisor of Broadcasting\nWOUB\nOhio University\nAthens, Ohio\nDear Mr. Greer;\n1 received the report which you submitted on your NAEB-\naided research project and it has been placed in the files\nof the Research Committee. I feel that these reports, which\nhave been aided by the NAEB, should be published where the\nmembership of the organization may receive the benefits which\nmay accrue from knowledge of the results. Therefore, I would\nstrongly suggest that this be written up for the NAEB Journal.\nIf you are not successful in getting it published there, we\nwill see about the possibility of its distribution as part of\nthe NAEB Factsheet service. I believe that it would receive\na better reading, however •• more widespread — in the Journal.\nI would offer two suggestions for the rewrite which you\ndo for publication. It is difficult to evaluate the meaning\nof the strong rise in llstenershlp after your AM outlet went\non the air without knowing the date at which it did. You tell\nus when the wired-wireless went on the air, when FM went on\nthe air, but neglect the specific AM date. If your survey\ntook place immediately after this first station in the com¬\nmunity went on, we could certainly hypothesize an atypical\nlistening pattern. You owe it to the reader to give him the\nspecific information which will allow him to evaluate your\nresults and conclusions.\nThe second suggestion would be a clarification of item 1\non page 10. X have not had an opportunity to check that v56\nissue of Sponsor but aren't their figures the percentage of the\npopulation who listen at some time during the evening. Your\nfigures more nearly approach the percentage having sets on at\nany one time. If the former is so (on the Sponsor figures)\nthis could explain your underestimate.\nLastly, since you seem to be concerned with generaliza¬\ntions to a broader population from this sample, I wondered why"
