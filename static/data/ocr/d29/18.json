You know, the\nshirt cuff - shooting act of\nbooming Britain, in top form\nchaps, don’t rock the boat\nand that appalling worldly-\nwise chaff that makes' you\nwant to find an aspidistra to\ngo behind for the old heave-\n.ho.” :\nI This editor, being astute\nand knowledgable, adds that\nMr. Macmillan’s performance\n“probably hit the right note”\nboth for “the callow 21-year-\nold and for the faithful old\ngardener ”\nOf course, Mr. McLuhan\nsays, the editor is perfectly\nright, the British Prime Min¬\nister did hit the right note\nand the Toronto expert adds:\n“I told you so days before the\nelection,” which indeed he\nhad done. Mr. McLuhan ex¬\nplains that the British elec¬\ntorate’s preference for Mr.\nMacmillan’s brand of what\nthe Americans would call tall\ncorn (a particularly “toff-\nridden” type of corn) is com¬\nparable to Canadian favor for\nMr. Diefenbaker’s style\n(evangelical sincerity) and\nthe U.S. popularity of Mr.\nEisenhower’s image — not a\nfather figure, according to\nMcLuhan but a little boy\nfigure. And the modern\nmedia are almost bound to\nwork for the conservatives\neverywhere. Here is why\naccording to MarshaH Mc¬\nLuhan:\nModern media (telegraph,\ntelephone, radio and above\nall television) have trans¬\nformed our world from a\nlinear one into a simultaneous\none.\nBefore these modern media\n(but after printing was in¬\nvented) man received most of\nhis information by the pro¬\ncess of -reading lines of print,\nstrings of words which he in¬\nterpreted. An effort of under¬\nstanding and interpretation\nwas required.\nBefore the invention of the\ntelegraph and the “news\nstory”, newspapers were pub¬\nlications dedicated to one\npoint of view, or in other\nwords, publications pointing\ntoward one view, develop¬\ning one argument which had\nto be followed, with a finger\nfollowing the printed words\nif necessary.\n; Then, with radio, telephone\n) apd television contributing in-\n! formation, different points of\n. view started coming in at the\n! individual from every direc-\n[ tion and without requiring\n[ from him the discipline of fol-\nt lowing the line of print, the\ndiscipline of deciphering a\n. passage and deciding for him-\ni self what it meant. He now is\ntold what everything means,\ni He does not have to assemble\n* the image of himself as if it\n1 were a jigsaw puzzle. The\ni image comes to him whole\n. through a television tube,\n- through sound and sight, and\nthe same image1 comes simul-\n1 tane.ously to everyone, and\nj many more than one image\ncome to each person from all\nf the media and from all direc-\nI tions.\n8 Thus it becomes impossible\nto have a single point of view.\nI Unconsciously, modern West-\n3 ern man becomes accustomed\n3 to this lack of “single points\n- of view.” He no longer sees\nthings as lines or paths of\nthought, but as fields of\na thought, even as spheres in¬\nside which he finds himself,\nd Habit becomes second na¬\nture; the televiewer becomes\ntherefore uncomfortable with\nlines of argument. Instead he\nwants, seeks, understands, wel¬\ncomes images. Moreover, the\nman of this modem simulta¬\nneous world, this total world,\nnatura”v expects (unconscious¬\nly) that everything should be\ntotal. He wants, for instance,\ntotal security; not just eco¬\nnomic security but cultural\nsecurity, social security, emo¬\ntional security. The young\nbuild their own world, a large\nfamily, in which they can be\nsecure. The “beatniks,” the\narticulate among the young,\nseek total satisfactions. A job\nis not total satisfaction, but\nlots of sex and lots of almost\nuniformly mediocre art are\ntotal satisfactions. The down¬\ngrading of individual effort\nand individual excellence en¬\nsures that the mediocre ma¬\njority will not be made to feel\ninsecure by a brilliant minor¬\nity.\nWhy does this help the con¬\nservatives in the Western\nworld (and McLuhan refers\nonly to the Western world)?\nThe modern voter, the one,\nthat is, whose self has been\nturned by media from linear\nto total, does r.ot seek for\npolicies or issues. The re¬\nmarkable fact about the re¬\ncent U.S., Canadian and Brit¬\nish elections, says McLuhan,\nis the lack of issues. Issues\nrequire arguments and the\nfollowing of arguments. The\nmodern voter wants an image.\nMoreover, it must be a secure\nimage: evangelical sincerity,\nboyish guilelessness, or the\ntoff’s promise, “don’t worry\nchaps, I’ll look after every¬\nthing.” Hence, when such an\nimage is projected, there is an\nunusually heavy turnout of re¬\nlieved citizens, rushing to vote\nfor that reassuring face on the\ntelevision screen.\nReds Push\nCampaign\nIn Spain\nLondon Observer Service\nCommunism, which was al¬\nmost indiscernible in Spain a\nfew years ago, is now a well-\norganized underground move¬\nment with a new plan of cam¬\npaign.\nEvidence of the new\nmethod and a willingness to\noffer martyrs to the cause\nhas been shown in the recent\ntrial for subversion when a\nmilitary court in Madrid sen¬\ntenced the principal defend¬\nant, Simon Sanchez Montero,\nto 20 years in prison.\nMontero not only admitted\nbeing a member of the cen¬\ntral committee of the clande¬\nstine Communist Party but he\nproudly claimed to have led\nthe organization of several\npacific protests against the\nrise in the cost of living and\nIn favor of “national recon¬\nciliation.” But in fact most\nof these protests were initi¬\nated by Socialists, and other\nnon-Communist groups.\nBy imposing such heavy\npenalty for such minor of¬\nfenses, General Franco’s mili¬\ntary court may well have\nplayed into the calculating\nhands of the Communists.\nAt the fifth congress of the\nSpanish Communist Party,\nheld in Prague in 1955, its\nsecretary - general, Dolores\nIbarruri, presented a lengthy\nreport, a considerable part of\nwhich was devoted to\nanalyzing past mistakes of\nthe party. The most serious\nerror was considered to be\n“not to have left in Spain a\nclandestine organization at\nthe end of the civil war.”\nThat report, subsequent\nCommunist manifestos to\nSpaniards, and instructions\n' circulated among Spanish\nCommunists, give a clearer\npicture of a plan and tactics\nnow in operation. The Com¬\nmunists are urged to uproot\nthe “civil war mentality”, to\nabhor all forms of demagogy,\nand to exercise moderation.\nMany Communists are or¬\ndered to attend confession\nand communion in the Catho¬\nlic . Church, both as an\nexample to true believers and\nas a way to soften the clergy."
