And this will cost you moneyj\nBurton has sent me a check for $31.97* There is $31*87\nin the account. If I send the check through it will bounce.\nTo clear the check will probably cost another ten cents. Why\ndon*t you go to the bank and deposit the necessary twenty cents\nif that will do it - so I can be sure the check will clear\nbefore I start it through. I will be happy to send you a\npostal order, a bank draft, or simply buy you a beer some day\nfor your trouble and cash advance.\nSincerely yours.\nFESijs\nFrank E. Schooley\nTreasurer"
