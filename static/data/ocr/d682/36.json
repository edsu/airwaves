AND NETWORK HEADQUARTERS will all insist on standard, orderly\nprocedure from each other and will uphold such procedure on their own parts.\nThis report is not in any sense meant to be negative. On the contrary,\nadvances in Network activity are duly noted. When we say that \"your problems are\nnot Ours, but ours are defintely yours,” we are not trying to be ungracious, but\nmerely to emphasize that the Network has not passed out of the stations’ hands:\nit exists only as a function of you, the NAEB, your stations. It is your Network,\nnot ours.\nNor in speaking of Network problems do we mean to imply that we are un¬\naware of your many problems: many of you must struggle constantly for funds, for\nstaff, to rebuff unjustified interference, to justify your very existance. Mere¬\nly recognizing the existance of problems does not solve them, of course; but the\nhistory of NAEB and the Network does provide strong grounds for the belief that\nwe shall.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJohn Holt\nManager, NAEB Network\nMaterial for this report was collected with the assistance of Rosaline T. Biason,"
