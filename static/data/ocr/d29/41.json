For, whereas learning and teaching have since\nGutenberg been based on the publisher of print, E.T.V. makes\nof the teacher and researcher himself a publisher on a very\nlarge scale.\nLaurence Bums, the President of R.C.A., in announcing\nthe imminence of video-tapes for ordinary home use, argued\nthat the day is at hand when teachers will make his kind of\nsalary, $170,000 a year. Such a view of the new educational\ndimensions seems to occur naturally within industry if not\nin education to-day. For teachers, of course, it serves\nmerely to indicate new patterns and landmarks set up before\nthe old scene has disappeared.\nSuch a prospect serves also to point out that a mere\npersonal point - o f le w is no longer a way of coming to grips\nwith such a fast-changing situation. In the midst of\naccelerated change, the only relevant strategy is what Wells\nFoshay has described as \"swarming all over the situation\"."
