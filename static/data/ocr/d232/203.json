The full Board, of course, will meet as\nusual in Columbus at the time of IERT.)\nI suggest, therefore, that the Executive Committee meet at the earliest\npossible date in January. In order that you may have a choice, I am list¬\ning below ten dates beginning with Friday, January *f, and requesting that\nyou circle those when you could attend a two-day meeting*\n^ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n(AN£ COMMENTS AS TO PREFERENCES?)\n^§xt is the question of place* We could meet at some centrally located\nplace at Chicago, at the NAEB headquarters in Urbana, or we could rotate\namong our several locations. The advantage of Chicago is convenient access;\nthe advantage of Urbana is that it is at NAEB headquarters (although this is\nsomewhat offset by the fact that Urbana is a harder city to get to than some\nof the other places listed). The advantage of meeting in turn in our\nrespective locations is that we could see each others* places of work£ further**\nmore, each time at least one member of the committee would not need to travel.\nI am listing below (alphabetical^, the places where we might want to hold\nour first meeting. Please number them in the order of your choices\nChicago\n____ Columbus\n__ East Lansing\n__ Lincoln\n.. Minneapolis.\n_____ Urbana\n«___ Other"
