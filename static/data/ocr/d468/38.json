Judge; but I don®t see where it fits in.\nIt fits in this way, Mr, Governor, We ®ve got our bad eggs, and our\nrotten apples* same as anyone else; but even when they®re bad, they®ve\ngot a democratic flavour about them. That fellow talked to me from the\ndock as though I were his equal; no, he did better than that. He\ntalked to me as though he were my employer.\nAnd so he was too. We®re both of us employed by the people.\nWot only that, but that umbrealla really tickled iry fancy. There®s\na man who®s particular, who has respect for himself, and a liking for\ncreature comforts, I®d like either of you gentlemen to show me a\nEuropean burglar who got caught because he thought enough of himself\nto mind the rain.\nIf you will forgive me, sir, your story shows me something else. The\nway you tell it, shows me a sort of fundamental sympathy with this wrong\ndoer,\nI wouldn®t exactly say that, A good judge ought to come at a criminal,\nthe way he goes for a bottle of port; try him carefully, then punish\nhim severly.\nBut nonetheless, I detect a feeling that this man is, after all, a human\nbeing.\nWell, isn®t he?\nQuite so; but in our country, there are many people who find it very\nhard to realise that.\nBEAU;"
