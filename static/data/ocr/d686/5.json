This, I hope, will free our facilities enough so\nthat we may be able to put into operation our plan to send\nyou the UN meetings. I shall certainly wire you when, as,\nand if the first tapes are transmitted via Northwest Airlines*\n1 am enclosing copies of two talks, one by Mr*\nCanby, and on© by Mr* Randolph, concerning the keeping of\ngood music on the air* It seems to m© that this might be\nuseful grist for the \"News-Letter\" mill*\nI am somewhat concerned about not receiving a\ncopy of the minutes of the Board of Directors meeting in\nWashington* The authority for a great many expenditures is\ncontained in these minutes, and I do hope you will get them\nto me as soon as possible.\nI wonder, too, whether you can undertake the\npublication of an up-to-date list of the active membership"
