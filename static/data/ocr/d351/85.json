Marcus\nProducer-Director\nTelevision Station WISB ‘ v \"! 4 * 1W\nMichigan State University\nSast Lansing, Michigan\nDear Mr* Marcus*\nAs Chairman of the MASS Public Relations Committee, I have been giving a\ngood deal of thought to the matter of the National Educational Radio and\nTelevision Week* In fact, I have been thinking about this matter for\nsomething like two years*\nIn spite of the immediate and ecstatic appeal that such a week would\nundoubtedly have for those people engaged in educational broadcasting\npursuits not to mention the PTA’ers and educators in general, I am some¬\nwhat reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the results of such a week\nwould not be commensurate with the efforts involved* Therefore, I would\ncounsel against it although I would willingly lend all support to the\neffort and go along with the idea if such a thing was approved as NAEB\npolicy*\n1 am against the idea for the following reasons* First, in considering such\na matter, it is essential to place everything in its proper focus* Un¬\ndoubtedly such a week would be hailed with great enthusiasm by the groups\nmentioned above but, after all those groups do not require such a week—they\nare already sold on educational broadcasting* As for the other people within\nour possible reach, I can honestly say that such a week would be in the same\ncategory as National Flag Week, National Heart Fund Week, National Be-Kind-\nTo-Anlmals Week and no end of other worthwhile causes to which we would give\na respectful but unimpressive look* If there were only two or three such\nweeks a year, my feeling would be different} but based upon my public rela¬\ntions experience of the past plus pure hunch, I doubt if the effort would\ncause much of a ripple among those who are not already sold on us* There\nis Just too much dilution in the week's idea* Even the commercial radio\nstations who have everything at stake in putting over the function cause\nlittle if any attention with their National Radio Week even though the NAB\nspent a big hunk of money in station assists*\nMy other objection which is really a corollary of the first is something\nthat is well expressed, although for another purpose in Bemle Kamine* letter"
