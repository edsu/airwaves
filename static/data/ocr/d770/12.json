I will look forward with much pleasure to the\ncontributions which, in the co-operative spirit which has marked earlier\nABU conferences, the delegates will make to the work that lies before us\nin October.\nThe next step in the preparation for the meetings in Auckland and Sydney is the\ncompletion of the documents for use during these meetings. I am attaching\nfor easy reference, a further copy of the schedule and I would like to emphasise\nthe point made by our Secretary-General, in writing to members recently,\nthat any of our full or associate members may contribute reports on any of\nthe agenda items.\nIn the case of the Engineering Committee, for example, three of our members\nhave so far supplied information about the reports they will be submitting\nunder the main agenda items and these are shown, for the information of\nother members, as sub-heading in the agenda. I hope other members will\nalso be presenting reports for use by the Committee during its meeting and\nthat, similarly, members will contribute documents relating to other sections\nof the agenda.\nASIAN Bli\nYOSHINORI MAEDA\nPRESIDENT\nDear Member,\nProf. William G.
