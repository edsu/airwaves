Com.\nIstanbul\nPLACES MD DATES OF FUTURE MEETINGS\nThe Committee is very well placed as regards invitations\nfor the future, the situation being as follows :\nAutumn 1971 (30 September - 2 October)\nHelsinki\n(YLE)\nSpring 1972\nMunich\n(ARD)\nAutumn 1972\nBergen\n(NRK)\nSpring 1973\nLondon\n(BBC)\nAutumn 1973\nSalzburg\n(ORF)\nThe Committee might already like to consider the dates of\nits Spring 1972 meeting bearing in mind that Easter falls early\nthat year, on 2 April. It is now known that the Technical Committee\nis also meeting in Munich, at the invitation of the ZDF, between\n10 - 14 April 1972 and in order not to clash with this meeting in\nany way and, indeed, to facilitate observers from each Committee\nbeing present at the otherâ€™s meeting, as has now become a well\nestablished practice (unfortunately made impossible at Istanbul\nsince the two Committees are meeting simultaneously), the Secretary\nwould like to suggest that the Radio Programme Committee consider\nthe dates of Thursday 6, Friday 7 and Saturday 8 April 1972,\nassuming, of course, the agreement of the ARD."
