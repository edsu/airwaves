Sulaer, Director\nRadio and Television Conraimications\nInliana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Broxao*\nTom had already thoughtfully sent me a copy of his suggestions for the\nFTt guide..#and I*ve looked it over quite thoroughly. He has some very\ngood points to add, I think, but the truth of the matter is that we\nstill have an Unlimited\" supply of that particular booklet—and I\ndoubt that we* 11 be reprinting ary time soon. However, I think we\nshould keep his suggestions in mind for any future revision.\nI agree that the brevity and readability of the present guide has been\nthe main reason for its acceptance. Perhaps, though, we could incor-\nporete some of Tom1® suggestions by adding a couple of other points and\npages, rather than adding to specific pages as he has outlined.\nYes, things do seem to be working out quite well on the promotion\nmaterials distribution at conventions and workshops. I’m pleased.\nThanks very much for your cooperation on it.\nSincerely yours.\n(Mrs.) Betty MsKenaie\nPublications Editor\nBMC/dp\nenclosures\ncc* Mr. Thomas Fetry\nblcc: Mr. Harold E, Hill"
