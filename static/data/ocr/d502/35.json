Maybe I am old-fashioned or maybe I am still\nthinking about the old days when everything was done on\na voluntary basis. How do you feel about it?\nAre any of the other people involved in helping NAEB on\na semi-professional basis? What sort of a financial\nbasis would you think it fair for me to suggest.\nPlease give me your frsfenk opinion — and, of course,\nthis is in confidence. \\\nPS ask your Secretary to change my address\nas above. Thanks."
