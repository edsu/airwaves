In the fifteen years between January 1, 1921\nand January 1, 1337 the total number of educational station licenses in\nthe United States had dropped from 202 to 37. Several of these, in des¬\nperate efforts to survive , had made compromises which greatly clouded\nthe definition of educational broadcasting. Many were operating on a\ncommercial or semi-commercial basis. The membership of the AC UBS\nnumbered only 20 stations in 1933. By 1944 membership in the Associa¬\ntion (whose name was changed in 1934 to the NAEB) had risen to only 23\nstations •\nIn the late 193#*s the NAEB, working with the United States\nOffice of Education/filed requests for the reservation of both AM and FM\nradio frequencies for education In order to protect educational services\nagainst commercial onslaughts, which they were demonstrably unable to\nwithstand, with the hope of preserving these electronic media as resources\nof American/education. In its reservations of 1938 and 1940 the Federal\nCommunications Commission finally set aside five channels in the ultra-\nhigh radio band (later designated as FM) for education. No reservations\nwere granted for education in AM radio (the \"standard*0 radio service).\nThe NAEB is still continuing its efforts, with other responsible educational\ngroups, to secure such reservations for education, for aU available elec¬\ntronic media should, we feel, be as available to education as to commerce."
