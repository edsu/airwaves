William Griffiths\n- 3 -\nAugust 7th, 1952\n9) An initial order of ICC pressings of the entire\nJefferson series has been placed with the Columbia\nRecords, lac., and these will be sold, at cost, to\ncommercial stations. (Already almost 40 have\nrequested information concerning the series, as\na result of the news stories.)\n10) Publishers4 Weekly is working out a tie-in plan\nwith the Book-Sellers of America concerning all\nbooks recently published on Jefferson.\n11) The American Library Association will be setting\nup special Jefferson exhibits and special ’ Jefferson\nShelves'*, tieing-in with the broadcasts.\n? 2) It is expected that stories will appear in TIMS and\nNEWSWEEK.\nJ 3) Arrangements have not as yet been completed, but\nit is also expected that a feature story will appear\nin the SATURDAY REVIEW, with a pick-up by\nREADERS* DIGEST.\n14) A copy of the pressings is to be presented to\nPresident Truman, and this will be the basis\nfor an additional story.\n15) Pressings will also bo made available to educa¬\ntional institutions, schools, etc,, and a limited\nnumber will be sent to depository libraries.\nThe above is merely what we are doing in connection with THE\nJEFFERSONIAN HERITAGE. Equal, if not greater, efforts will\nbe made in connection with ' PEOPLE UNDER COMMUNISM *,\n•THE WAYS OF MANKIND\" and \"THE PEOPLE TALK BACK\",\nNAEB’s Board of Directors has not yet decided on whether any\nof these future shows should be released on a national network\nsimultaneously with or before release on NAEB stations. Pro¬\nmotional and publicity plans will necessarily depend onr h\naction."
