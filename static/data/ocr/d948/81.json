  "text": "As an example of the writer’s preparation and organization of a series, Mrs.\nStanley discussed a series she had written for Station WHA, \"Adventures in Our\nTown.\" The series came about in response to an interest in the social attitudes\nof post-war 19hS children expressed by the Wisconsin State Department of Instruc¬\ntion. The series was to be concerned with problems of living together, of toler¬\nance and understanding, of a reaffirmation of the inherent dignity of the indi¬\nvidual.\nPreparation, before writing began, included sending out a questionnaire to\nteachers, principals and administrators, offering a check-list of program subjects.\nThose who were circulated responded by checking a list of suggested topics for\nwhich they felt there was the greatest need. After topics were suggested, it\nwas necessary to determine a format which would appeal to the emotions of chil¬\ndren. After considering and discarding a number of formats, Mrs. Stanley and her\ncolleagues settled on a serial-type of drama, with a complete incident in each pro¬\ngram, but with a continuing cast of characters. The action was set in a mythical\nsmall town in Wisconsin, using a familiar child’s world to involve scenes which\npointed up problems the children were meeting in their own lives, and showing\nhow the family, the community, gangs, school, buddies and other groups solved\nthem. Mrs. Stanley pointed out certain salient features of the series:\n1) The series was designed not to change social attitudes immediately\nbut to have a cumulative effect.\n2) Children were used as characters because the young listeners would\nthen identify them; some character or some situation in each script\nmight be counted on to provide each listener with identification.\n3) Moralizing was avoided; the characters faced situations, then worked\nout their problems together, meeting a crisis and solving it through\nteamwork."
