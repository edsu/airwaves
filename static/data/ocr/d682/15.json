  "text": "The Possibility of a Gift by 3M\nIt would seem advisable to approach Minnesota Mining and\nManufacturing with a proposal that they donate a given amount\nin tape to further the operation of the NAEB Network,\nIt would seem to me that the figure should be placed at\nsomewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 reels.\nThe proposal to them should indicate among other things:\n1. The -fogfc fact that this is a national operation,\n2. The type of programming offered,\n3. Background on NAEB.\n4. Some prognostication of the future operation.\nAmong others the following points might be used as argument:\n1. The tie in between such a gift and 3MTs kind of advertising.\n2. Promoting the fact that the network has standardized on\n3M tape.\n3. Some arrangement whereby our operation can be used as a\nfactor in 3M advertising.\n4. The fabulous increase in the use of tape engendered by the\nNAEB operation.\n5. The fact that for years to come this supply will have to be\nreplenished at our expense.\n6. The possibility that it might be a tax-deductable item.\n7. The opportunity to join philanthropic organizations in\nfurthering a worth-while enterprize.\ng. The possibility of NAEB stimulating a nation-wide library\nservice of tape recorded material through libraries and\nschools, thus again vastly increasing the amount of tape\nused.\nMy suggestion is that we immediately prepare such a\nproposal and either Miles or Rider or both journey to St. Paul\nand chat with the president of 3M."
