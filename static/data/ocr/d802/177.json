Was he just trying to kill time\nwith his playing of Dietrichs * record? It was coa^letely beside the point,\nsince the voice similarity was obvious* Vote no*\nPOETRY HI SOHO* Vote yes on basis of last series*\nCURTAIN GOING UPt Vote yes for renewal*\nMEW DIRECTIONS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE* Vote yes*\nBOOKS AND ABOUND* Absolutely not. I can not tell from the submission\nform whether this is a school program or not* It doesn’t really matter*\nThe program format is a take-off on another MAEB program and not nearly\nso well done* It is trivial, eondenseending and takes in far too wide\nan audience range* The program I heard could not possibly interest\njunior high school listeners, and there is some doubt in my mind that it\nwould interest fourth graders*\nPATTERNS Of THOUGHT* A very interesting and challenging program*\nInformal without etumbling* Vote yes.\nF EB 2 7 1955\nPW\n7|?|9|1P(11|12| 1|2|8|4|5|6\ni"
