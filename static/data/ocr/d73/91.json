The education explosion,\nwhich can be made possible by our new elec¬\ntronic tools, is an explosion in thinking —\naffecting men’s minds.\nThe prime needs to accomplish this advance\nare: (1) broader scope in the concept and the\napplication of educational electronics; and (2)\na combining of the three arts — teaching,\nbroadcasting and graphics.\nPresent experiments must be drawn upon to\nlay out a broad business and research program\nto get adoption of plans for areas large enough\nto permit fundamental advances.\nThe need for greatly enlarged expenditures\nfor research in education itself is stressed by\nthe increasingly large number of basic ques¬\ntions that are urgently demanding answers.\nIn view of all these factors and the present\ncritical situation in education, I therefore pro¬\npose that:\n1. Plans for much broader use of educa¬\ntional television be drawn up for, say,\na state or group of states.\n2. A tape library of courses by distin¬\nguished teachers be created to support\nsuch a system. This scope is needed\nin order to demonstrate the great\nbenefits of educational TV in visual\nillustration of a magnitude too great\nfor a single classroom to undertake.\n3. The three arts — teaching, broadcast¬\ning and graphics — be united in the\ncreation of the tapes.\n4. A library of follow-up books to sup¬\nplement the tapes be developed.\n5. An R & D fund be set up by all edu¬\ncational units so that advances may go\non apace.\n6. Other tools of educational automa¬\ntion be brought into existence as\nquickly as possible.\n14"
