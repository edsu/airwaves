I'd explain the efforts you've already invested\nin getting special status for WNYC, and educational broadcasting in general, with\nexceptions, if any, the other way around from the way he now sees it. I'd hate\nto have what they do while they're a production center, using commercial outlets.\nJeopardise what they'd have when they get their own station. Do you suppose\nthat sane sort of clause could provide for that day?\nThis night not be too important to Art now. He'll probably hope far enough\nmoney to operate this way* But it would weaken the position of other ETV stations,\nand I think he should be aware of that problem.\nFrom there on, Maury, your wisdom is greater than mine in this area, and you'll\nprobably have to play it by ear. I do feel that this represents the inclination\nof the Center, which we discussed with Schooley earlier, to \"go along\" with the\nunions.\nBecause I'll be away for some time, I'm giving Frank a copy of Art's letter and\nthis reply, hoping he too may have seme ideas for you.\nSincerely,\nHJSsdfc\ncct Mr. Frank E. Schooley\nHarry I. Skoraia\nExecutive Director"
