  "text": "12\nIn brief, we are asking each applicant:\n-To state that they wish the application to remain as submitted,\nto be considered for funding in 1969. (Possible, of course, only\nif the request in Federal funds is less than the state maximum.)\n-Or - To amend projects so that revised total costs and Federal\nshares requested will become feasible within the limits of the\nappropriation and the state maximum.\n-Or - To request deferral of consideration of an application until\nthe next fiscal year.\nThat's all I want to say on the topic of pending applications at this\nmoment. We will entertain questions on the topic later, if you have any.\nBut on that subject, I can make another announcement, not covered in the\nmaterials handed to you. Among pending applications are 28 which have\nnot yet been accorded the status of \"accepted for filing.\" As most of you\nknow, to be accepted for filing is a status which has an effect on the\neligibility of apparatus in a project. So I'm pleased to announce that\nwe have taken the necessary steps to have those 28 applications accepted,\nand that those applicants can expect publication in the Federal Register\n(Very Soon) OR (Date, if we have it).\nUSE ONLY IF TRUE: Also not that effective dates of acceptances\nwill be retroactive. That is - the effective date of the\nacceptance will be different for each, and consistent with the\ndate on which the application became acceptable by our office."
