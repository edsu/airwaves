Harry Skornia had prepared a draft of a proposal for the\nFord Foundation which was gone over very carefully by the entire\ncommittee* On the basis of the committee2s reactions, he drew\nup a revision of it which was presented to and discussed with\nJohn Weiss in New York on February 1? and 18 by Dick Hull, Harry\nSkornia and me*\nWeiss gave careful and sympathetic attention to our proposals,\nbut indicated that he wished us to state more fully our concepts\nas to the basic problems of education which television might\nhelp solve, going thereafter to detail the particular projects\nfor which we requested financial support* In other words, Weiss\npointed out that we had assumed our major premise.\nHarry Skornia now is recasting the application, which will\nthen be resubmitted to Mr* Weiss*. This may or may not involve\na meeting of one or more of us with to* Weiss*\nIn the overall, Weiss was very sympathetic to our request*\nHe clearly is sold on the extensive use of television in education*\nBut he needs documentation from us to sell his enthusiasm to his\nfoundation associates*\nIII* Station activation proposals* I®ve had no further\nreactions to our activation proposal* As was earlier reported,\nthis was discussed with Henry Ohsdeayne, who decided to delay\npassing on the offer of committee chairmanship until more definite\nplans were evident! with Harry Neifburn, who seemed very favorable\ntoward the idea as we advanced it! end’with Albert Jorgensen and\nRalph Steetle, who weren9t very enthusiastic, but dldn8t comment\nat any length* At the JCET meeting of January 22, this matter\nwas not on the agenda- I did not bring it up from my side, since\nI could see nothing to be gained thereby* The foundation request\nas originally submitted to Weiss included $100,000 a year for\nthis for each of the next five years, but he did not react to\nany specific items, only commenting in a general way (as reported\nabove), though he undoubtedly will when we submit the final\nproposal to him soon*\nIV* Meeting with ETRC Staff In Ann Arbor on Granfcs«In«®Aid\nProject and Commissioned Radio Programs* You will recall the\ncorrespondence between Robert Hudson of the ETRC and our Grants*\nIn*Ald Committee chairman, Ned Rosenheim* This led to a meeting\nin Ann Arbor on January 20 attended by Rosenheim, Skornia and\nPaulu for NAEB, and Ken Christiansen, Robert Hudson, Harry Newburn,\nand Ray Stanley for the ETRC* There was definite accomplishment*\nFor one thing, Ray Stanley wrote up a seven page summary of things\ndiscussed and agreements reached (which was submitted to us for\nreaction), so that both ^sides” will know \\*hat was decided* Here\nis a summary of the high points*"
