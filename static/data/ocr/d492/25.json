In our chat with Miss Murray, she gave us wha\nMIGHT WELL BE USED AS AN INTRODUCTION TO TODAY’S\nPROGRAM DEALING WITH THE EFFECTS OF PREJUDICE ATTI¬\nTUDES.\nBY AND, LARGE, I WOULD SAY THAT SOME OF THE NEGATIVE\nCONSEQUENCES OF THESE ATTITUDES ON THE PART OF THE\nLARGER COMMUNITY ARE THAT THE SELF-IMAGE WHICH THE\nNegro has is constantly something which he must ove\nCOME IN HIMSELR. THE CONTINUAL POUNDING AWAY FROM\nLET US SAY, SEGREGATIONISTS, PEOPLE WHO ARE FULL 01\nBIGOTRY AND PREJUDICE, ON THE THEME THAT THE NEGRO\nINFERlOR...THAT HE HAS NOT YET DEVELOPED TO THE POI\nWHERE HE SHOULD, AS A MATTER OF RIGHT RECEIVE ALL 0\nTHE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OTHER PEOPLE DO...HAS MEANT\nthat the Negro has constantly had to overcome this\nfeeling of inferiority.

But\nNEVERTHELESS, THIS Ha S BEEN ONE OF THE REACTIONS,\nHAS, i THINK, CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF DISADVANTAGE\nWITHIN THE GROUP ITSELF.\nMiss Murray sharpens our awareness of this very si\nCONCEPT OF SELF-IMAGE.
