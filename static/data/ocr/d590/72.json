New stations\ngo on the air each month* When invited to membership in the NAEB, they ask what\nthe NAEB can do for them* The answer to this question not only determines whether\nthey will join but also how vigorously they can later justify to their administra¬\ntions an increase in NASS dues, the gradual introduction of charges for seminars,\nand the other contributions which each institution must assume in a mwiy-dev’sloping\nnational movement which must eventually support itself.\nSeme funds 3|or Seminars and Workshops, though more indirectly and slowly than\nsome of the other items discussed below, will greatly assist the NAEB to expedite\nthe achievement of self-supporting status through th© continued growth of respect\nwhich will accrua both to the individuals concerned and to the NAEB itself as the\nusefulness of both to American education is increasingly recognized.\nIn tbs recognitions which have case to numerous individuals in the NAEB in\nonly the last two or three years we see evidence that recognition of our role is\nbeginning to develop# Vie believe that ^polntmenis to various national commissions,\nexecutive committees and chairmanships of various national conferences, panels and\nmeetings constitute at least as much recognition for what the NAEB stands for as fa?\nthe individuals involved. This and other evidences give us confidence that the new\nrole we see for television and radio in America, based upon individuals with the\ntraining, devotion and inspiration which oily seminars can provide, can be welded\ninto a profession which will someday enjoy the respect which we now envi3ioi it as\ndeserving.\nThe success of NAEB publications already is heart-warming in view of the meager\nresources so far available to support them* N© note with pride the increasing\nnumber of quotations from the Newsletter, the Journal and other materials issued by\nthe Association, in foreign educational and broadcasting publications, as well as\nmany in the U.S*"
