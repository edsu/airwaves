  "text": "sets for Professor Ruth Underhill’s series “Red¬\nman’s America,” Hansen decided to do chalk\ndrawings, instead of painting; “much faster and\nmuch less messy, ’ ’ he says. Because photographs\nof a tribe of naked Indians could not be used, he\ndepicted them with plaster-lath figures.\nHansen’s supervisor, art director Don Allen, di¬\nrects not only the scene-design activities at\nKRMA but the collection and preparation of\nvisual aids as well. His eye for accuracy and\nauthenticity has traced objects ranging from a\nparticular type of door knob to World War I uni¬\nforms. In an optometrist’s office he once sighted\njust the chair he’d been hunting and rented it\non the spot. And he solved a nest of shipping\nproblems to get a fragile Indian headdress made\nof hummingbird feathers from a California mu¬\nseum. For title cards, he has used antique print¬\ning-type faces unearthed in old mining towns.\nArtwork for television benefits from the camera’s\nbenevolent blending. Sets, drawings, and props\nthat look unfinished to the naked eye appear au¬\nthentic on the screen. On the other hand, the\nmedium demands particular care in handling\ncolor. The black-and-white television camera\ntransmits only three basic values of gray. “Yet we\nuse colors in our sets and costumes for their psy¬\nchological value to the performer,” says Allen.\n“This avoids the pall that an environment of\ngrays and blacks might well cast. The colors must\nbe chosen skillfully to reproduce in the proper\nshades of gray for television transmission.”"
