It is not intended to supplant or usurp the functions\nof any other committee, nor does it reduce the status or role of any other\ncommittee.)\nStructure of the PrPBQged GamLtte±_\nThe committee will consist of one appointed chairman plus five or six\nmembers•\nThe Members will be the chairmen of those committees whose work bears\ndirectly on the Network project. At present these committees are the Network\nAcceptance, In-School Program, Radio Program Planning, International Relations,\nPublic Relations, and Engineering Committees.\nThese members are to understand that they are not appointed as \"personali¬\nties*! they automatically become members of the NAEB Network (Operations?)\nCommittee by virtue of being chairmen of the committees listed above. Should\na member leave his chairmanship, his successor will automatically replace him\nas a member of the NAEB Network (Operations) Committee.\nShould the work of other committees (eg. Grant-in-Aid, TV Program Planning,\netc.) come to bear on the Network operation, their chairmen will become members\nof the NAEB Network (Operations?) Committee. Whether or not such a committee*s\nwork justifies its chairman*s membership in the proposed committee will be\ndetermined cooperatively by the president of the NAEB, the chairman of the NAEB\nNetwork Committee, and the NAEB Headquarters office.\nThe Chairman of the NAEB Network Committee will not be the chairman nor\na member of any committee whose chairman is automatically a member of the\nproposed committee. He will be the only member of this committee who is\ndirectly appointed by the president of the NAEB, rather than assuming his\nposition by virtue of another appointment."
