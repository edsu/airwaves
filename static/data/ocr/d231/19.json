Harley, President\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nSuite 1119\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nI noticed in a recent issue of NAEB\nNEWSLETTER that the network is planning to\nlaunch a M Lecture-of-the - Week\" series featuring\nimportant lectures and speeches given on college\nand university campuses. It sounds like a good\nidea, and it occurred to me that we, as a company,\nmight be able to participate.\nThat is, I am wondering whether some of\nthe speeches given by key officers of Ford Motor\nCompany on subjects of general interest to all\nAmericans might be of interest to the NAEB. I am\nthinking of such speeches as those in recent months\nthat dealt with the topics of automation, world trade,\nand business ethics (see enclosures).\nIf this suggestion is of interest perhaps I\ncan explore it further with you or one of your people.\nBest regards to you and your associates.\n^Sincerely,\n'^\"William A. Harper\nEducational Affair\nRepresentative"
