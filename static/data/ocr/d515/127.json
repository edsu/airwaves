  "text": "CONCLUSIONS\nThe NAE3 Tape Network has achieved a position of eminence\nin the field of educational broadcasting# It is now enjoying a\nnational, and even an international, reputation# It is supplying\na significant program service to the vast majority of non-commercial\neducational stations in the United States# It is providing the\nresidents of the major population centers with a truly alternative\nradio service# It is clear that this has been possible because of\nthe grant from the Kellogg Foundation* It would not have been\npossible to weather the early days of the operation without this\nhelp# It is equally clear that continuing support by the using\nstations will be accomplished to a degree in excess of the most\ngenerous estimates#\nThis much has been achieved before the network reached\nits maximum efficiency# The full potential of this idea will not be\nrealized until the mass duplicator is installed. The keen enthusiasm\nexpressed by member stations has been developed while operating\nunder a system that precludes regular, dependable, and timely service#\nThis will be altered during the summer of 19^2#\nProgram resources are maturing and developing at a most\nencouraging rate# National organizations, governmental agencies,\nforeign governments, international organizations, and private pub¬\nlic service groups are now exercising the initiative in providing\nprograms for the network. In the fall of 19^2 the network will\nbegin the distribution of programs produced under a grant from the\nFund for Adult Education# This project was predicated on the exist¬\nence and efficient operation of a tape network service. Plans are\ndeveloping for extensive cooperative program production by member\nstations *"
