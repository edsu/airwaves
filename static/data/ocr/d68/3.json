As we explore ways of\ngetting at its best performance, experience indicates that this helpful\nmedium does not bestow identical blessings in all cases, and we are\nbeginning to see why it may succeed in one classroom to a greater extent\nthan in others and appear to favor some teachers or school systems more\nthan others.\nThe plain truth is that instructional television works best for those who\nknow how to use it, The object of these kits is to help you join the ranks\nof those who know, for this is no mysterious body of knowledge, no com¬\nplex system of new and hard-to-learn techniques. As you view these\nfilms and see television taking its place in the classroom, see good\nteachers working with television in effective ways, you will likely dis¬\ncover thatyou are already prepared to use it properly. The methods are\nthose which all good teachers know well. Clues to some of the answers\nare found within you, yourself, in yourown personal strengths and weak¬\nnesses, your particular capabilities, and your special interests.\nYou need only acquire some new ways of thinking about yourself and\nyour important work, some guidelines for organizing the help at hand\ninto more useful patterns. We think you will find that in seeking out\ntelevision's best ways of working, you will have discovered yours, too.\nThese Demonstration Kits are distributed by:\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nWashington, D. C.\nAdditional information may be obtained by writing to:\nDr. Clair R. Tettemer\nNAEB Teaching Materials Library\nc/o KFME-TV/Channel 13\nHighway 81 South\nFargo, North Dakota 58101\niii"
