It seems\nto me that this whole procedure is certainly not only an undemocratic\nmethod but a very unsatisfactory one. Therefore, I am proposing an\namendment to the constitution and by-laws of NAEB, which I hop© your\ncommittee will be good enough to approve and present to the membership\nof NAEB for a vote«\nUnfortunately, I do not have a late copy of the constitution and by-laws\nat hand. Therefore, I am unable to say just where the proposed amend¬\nment would fit in or what section or sections it would replace,, After\nall, that is immaterialo\nPlease let me have your reaction to this proposal«\nAction should take place on this as soon as possible0\nJWD/am\nEnclosure"
