For the first survey there was no\nAM. But since the purpose of the whole project was to compare\nlistenership, it was felt advisable to keep the questions constant\nfor both groups.\nIf the respondent answered \"no\" to question 2, question\n3 was asked.\n3. \"Do you own an EM radio?\" With the AM facility established the\nquestion of the advisability of continuing with a n FM transmission\nwas bound to arise. This question would estimate the potential\nFM audience.\nlu \"Do you have a television set or sets in your hone?\" This question\nwas asked to establish TV set ownership as well as providing a\npopulation for future investigations.\n5# \"Would you mind if one of our students were to contact you at a\nfuture time to ask some more questions about radio and TV?\" This\nquestion was asked to discover the general feeling about the\nconducting of surveys in Athens, Ohio, as well as a list of\nindividuals who might not cooperate on other types of investigations\nat seme future times.\n1. (Changed to WOUB for the third survey)"
