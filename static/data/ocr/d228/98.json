  "text": "August 7,1962\nMr. Nick Zapple\nSenate Interstate and Foreign\nCommerce Committee\nRoom 126-A\nSenate Office Building\nWashington 2b, DC,\nDear Nick:\nHere is a draft of a memorandum which reflects our thinking\nabout the need for this coordinated approach for ETV development,\nparticularly on the professional development of personnel involved.\nThis particular memo attempts to concretize this approach through\nan actual structure to house these particular services. A building,\nhowever, is not the important aspect of the matter—it is the services\nthat need to be performed and are not now being performed.\nMy office will await your call with reference to possible\nappointment for Mr. Pace to meet with the Senator. As I explained.\nPace will be in Washington August 13th, 21st or 22nd, and 24th.\nI hope something can be worked out to bring them together\nbecause I think this is very important and I appreciate your willing¬\nness to help.\nCordially yours,\nWGH:pw\nEnclosures\nWilliam G. Harley"
