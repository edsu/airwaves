The following summary includes all questionnaires returned to\ndate.\nNumber of stations returning questionnaire---——** 38\nThose favoring old method-—---*-— 2\nThose favoring Package method-—-—-——-———-31*\nNeutral---———--—-—— 2\nAs indicated in the note from Audrey June Booth at KUOM, there are\ndrawbacks to the package system. This can not be dm led. However, it\nis to be noted that some of the difficulties she mentions would be worse\nunder the old method. Actually the one she reco?m»nds is impossible at\nthis time; although it is the method planned for the future.\nIt was also interesting to find a nunfoer of stations that feel\nthe package system should be retained permanently for programs which are\nnot limited in time of use. This should be supplemented by direct two-\nway, headquarters-station distribution for timely shows.\nJim Miles has the copies of the returned questionnaires.\nIt is hoped this explains, at least in part, why the package sys¬\ntem is being used!\nRichard L.
