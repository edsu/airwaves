  "text": "It IS often said that Asia today is in ferment.\nThis ferment is only partially political. To be\nsure, six hundred million Asians, a fourth of the\nhuman race, have entered the community of\nindependent and democratic countries since\nWorld War II. But the political independence\nAsians cherish and have fought for so long is\nonly one aspect of the renaissance that stirs\nthem. They want for themselves and their chil¬\ndren not merely national dignity, but increased\npersonal dignity and increased material oppor¬\ntunities. They know that these goals are not au¬\ntomatically reached by the formal achievement\nof independence nor attained without continu¬\nous struggle.\nThey need, as we did almost two hundred\nyears ago, the time within a framework of\npeace to grapple successfully with the massive\nproblems that challenge their ability and test\ntheir determination at every level of existence.\nThey also need assistance. They recognize\nthat no country in today’s narrowing world\ncan solve its problems in isolation. They want\nand welcome assistance given with understand¬\ning and respect. But they, as we, resent outside\ninterference in their internal affairs. They op¬\npose the encroachment of totalitarian ideologies\nand movements, and they resist any attempts to\nreimpose colonialism.\nDifferences of opinion exist and will continue\nto exist among the Asian nations and between\nthem and the United States on many of the\nworld’s problems. They cannot be ignored. Al¬\nthough natural, especially among free societies\nof diverse cultures, such differences breed mis¬\nunderstanding and suspicion. They should not\nbe permitted, however, to obscure the large and\nwidening areas of common Asian-American\naspirations and interests. We should welcome\nthe renaissance in Asia. Its vast potentialities in\nthe realm of thought and action are of great\nsignificance to us all."
