Per pupil costs\nfor instruction by television are about one-third less than by other\nmeans. There is evidence that television, properly used, can do as\ngood a job as any other method of teaching.\nThere are other great areas of challenge for education by\ntelevision. There is an opportunity to enrich the regular elementary\nand secondary program. The demand for foreign language instruction in\nthe elementary schools of Denver is being served by the unique advantages\nof television. Classroom teachers were not well able to teach foreign\nlanguages. The instruction ms offered by television. Teachers and\nstudents alike were able to learn at home and continue the work at\nschool.\nPre-school children make up one of the largest groups of\npotential listeners. Instruction by conventional means has been\nprovided for many years. Commercial TV with such programs as Ding Dong\nSchool first served this group. We should recognize a great opportunity\nfor educational television.\nWe now see an important general demand for conventional\ncourses of instruction offered by television. There is no longer any\ndoubt that people will take television courses seriously. Organized\nlearning experiences offered by television are popular. Courses need\nnot be taken for credit to hold attention.\nThe most significant things often happen during times of\nstress and strain. During this period of need for more school buildings\nand educational personnel and facilities, television may find its place."
