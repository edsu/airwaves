I am enclosing the brochure provided by\nthe host institution. The American University. Should you need more\ndetailed information, may I suggest you contact the following individual\nwho, more than anyone else, has been responsible for the real success\nof the Workshop: Dr. Roger Penn, Associate Professor, The Urban Broad¬\ncasting Workshop, Communication Building, The American University,\nWashington, D. C. 20016\nIt is interesting to note that you too are weary of stating problems\nand are ready to seek solutions in regard to programming for the Disadvan¬\ntaged. Stations all over America are reporting the same attitude and are\ndoing something concrete about it.\nIncidentally, my use of the term \" Die advantaged” is not reserved for\nblacks. The TV and Radio program reports that go out of my office each week\ntell of programs for, by and about disadvantaged Caucasians, Mexican-\nAmericans, American Indians as well as Negroes. We are interested in\n‘•the people left behind” and that is not the exclusive compond of Negroes.\nI would be very interested to know what WBAA is doing in this area of\nprogramming. Would you be kind enough to drop me a note to this effect?\nSincerely,\nKRC:ilh\nEnclosure\nKenneth R. Clark\nProject Director"
