The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL\nBroadcasters is the recipient of one of these grants. NAEB has\nPROPOSED RESEARCH I I^JO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEDIA. The PRINCIPAL\nINVESTIGATOR FOR THE PROJECT IS Dr. HERBERT MARSHALL McLUHAN,\nProfessor of English at the University of Toronto, who is a consultant\nto the NAEB. Cooperating with Dr. McLuhan will be the NAEB\nResearch Committee and the CBC Research Department.\nAs A NATIONAL EFFORT IS MADE TO INTENSIFY THE USE OF NEW MEDIA IN\nAmerican education, we are confronted with the frightening prospect\nTHAT, IN THE PRESENT STATE OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIQUE AND OFTEN\nSUBLIMINAL AND UNPERCEIVED EFFECTS OF MEDIA, AS MEDIA, PRESENTLY\nPROPOSED USES MAY ENDANGER ALL OR MUCH THAT IS BEST, AND DESERVING\nOF PRESERVATION, IN OUR PRESENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. MOST, IF NOT\nALL, PRESENT AND PROPOSED PROJECTS WOULD APPEAR TO BE BASED LARGELY\nON THE ERRONEOUS IMPRESSION THAT THE NEW MEDIA ARE MERELY EXTENSIONS\nOF PREVIOUSLY EMPHASIZED P R I N T-M E/iJpA . The C ® N T I I^J A T I O N OF THIS\nCONCEPT, OR OF THE CURRENT EMPHASIS ON TOOLS-OR I ENTAT ION, CAN EITHER\nGREATLY HAMPER THE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH THESE MEW MEDIA CAN\nMAKE, OR, IF NOT CONTROLLED, CAN BE MOST DANGEROUS TO AMERICAN EDUCATION\nAS A WHOLE. An UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIQUE BIASES, DISTORTIONS AND\nLIMITING QUALITIES OF ALL MEDIA, AND THEIR DAILY CHANGING RELATIONS TO\nEAC H OTHER NEEOS TO BE DEVELOPED, LEST THE PATTERN SET BY OURRENT //\nUSAGBS, AND CURRENTLY PROPOSED PROJECTS — IGNORING THE MESSAGES OR\nIMPACT OF THE MEDIA THEMSELVES AS MEDIA, INDEPENDENT OF INTENDED USE\nOR CONTENT\nBE A DISSERVICE TO POSTERITY"
