Our creditors\nare used to waiting a few days longer, since in most\ncases they understand the nature of the project and know\nit is not a \"business\".\nI wish I could write and tell you I've got a\nwonderful Spring tan, but about all I can say is that\nI've still got a wonderful winter pallor, and unless the\nweather breaks soon that is all we will all have.'\nProfessor McLuhan has just looked in, so it's\nback to the letters. With the project ending soon\nthings seem to be piling up, but it will all come out\nfine I'm sure.\nBy the way. In order to keep within your June 30\ndeadline, what is the latest date suggested to send\nfinal statements, or broach questions? I can arrange\nfor our accounts to bill us before the end of the\nmonth wherever possible.\nAgain, most sincerely,\nY. /\n(Miss) Ruth Nusbaum.\nRECEIV ED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nMAY 2 3 I960\nAM Pi\nl7|?|?lW|12|l,2i8|4l?l?\nL"
