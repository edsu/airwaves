He agreed as to the\nneed for the kind of action we outlined, and, when the\nproposal was first made. Indicated willingness to accept\nappointment as chairman of the Station Activation and\nDevelopment Committee, subject, however, to the approval of\nRaymond Wittcoff, the chairman of the St, Louis station Board\nof Directors,\nOn Monday afternoon, December 9th, therefore, the NAEB\ncommittee and Chadeayne met with Ray Wittcoff, Wittcoff too\nagreed as to the necessity for such a plan, and said he had\nno objection to Chadeayne accepting the appointment if he\nwanted to do so. But Wittcoff went on to say that he believed\nthis task was basically one that should be done under the\naegis of the ETRC, not the NAEB, although its development\nwould undoubtedly involve NAEB, as an organization as well as\nits local station representatives.\nThis matter was discussed at considerable length, and in\na very friendly manner. Nevertheless, Wittcoff held his\nground. After this; discussion, Chadeayne then decided to\nwithhold his final \"yes\" until he saw the course of events,\nmentioning specifically a desire to find out what would be\nthe reactions of/the ETRC and the JCET, and also the amount\nof money which could be obtained (with its consequent indication\nof the magnitude of the operation)."
