Tettemer\nNorth Central Educational Television\nAssociation\nBox 6\nFargo,North Dakota\nDear Clair:\nlam enclosing a copy of a completely revised budget for our amendment\nto the Utilization Kit Project. You'll note that this is substantially\nmore than we had originally planned, but we have reviewed it carefully\nwith Office cff Education personnel and they feel that we will have a far\nbetter produce if we are able to spend more per film. I could not disagree\nwith this and accepted their recommendation to increase the cost $9,000\nper film. We hope to have an answer on this in two weeks.\nIn the meantime I think you may want to postpone the meeting of the\nAdvisory Committee until this matter is settled. It would be considerably\nbetter to have this approved and signed before we do any more analysis\nof the treatments. Having additional funds for each film should make a\ndifference in the kind of analysis which we make.\nRegarding the treatment for Kit No. 2, my feeling is that this is generally\nquite well done, although it takes quite awhile to get into it and once into\nit, the matters concerning television are handled in fairly trite terms. The\ntestimonials are not likely to be taken well and my feeling is that they\nwill probably be rather ineffectual. If these could be done fear real in a\nclassroom setting or a superintendent's office, I would be more inclined\nto find this idea attractive.\nOn page 25, the sequence with illustrations which shows television\nmeeting various needs might have a slightly different emphasis. For\nexample, instead of having the narrator saying that television can\ninvite viewers to learn..., I think we would be further ahead if we talked\nit from the point of view that \"with television, a teacher can invite and\nstimulate viewers to learn...\" contribute to the creation of attitudes, etc."
