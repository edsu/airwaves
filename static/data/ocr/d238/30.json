By now you will also\nhave received, under separate cover, a copy of the Ford Foun¬\ndation letter which indicates why some of my energies have\ngone with another kind of prodding.\nI wish you would collect as many ideas of your own as possible\nfor an “interior” transcribed net in the event our\nlarge scale plans run into hazards.\nIf you could possibly come to Ann Arbor a day early it would\nhave a great deal of merit, as we are going to have one heck\nof a lot of business; and if we can get rolling before the\ngeneral meeting, it will certainly help.\nYours sincerely.\nPresident\nap\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W. SMYTHE\nIllinois University Communi¬\ncations Research Institute\nUrbana, Illinois\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
