In\none Midwestern area, 30, 000 pupils in 1, 000 different classes are being\ntaught Spanish by an exceptionally talented teacher at a per-pupil cost\nof less than a penny a lesson. Directors of the Midwest Program on\nAirborne Television Instruction estimate that if 1, 000, 000 pupils use the\nprogram the first year, the cost of each childâ€™s televised education will\nbe no more than $2. Eventually, they hope to reduce the cost to 50 cents\na child.\nOur success or failure with educational television will have\nprofound implications throughout the world. Our partners in the Western,\nalliance are also faced with the problem of educating their children with\ntoo few teachers and too few classrooms. They, too, recognize the urgency\nof getting better results for lower per-pupil costs.\nBut formidable as the educational problems of the Western\nnations are, they are far outstripped by those of the developing areas -of\nAsia and Africa. Scarcely half the world's 550 million school-age children\nare actually receiving any formal education, and the bulk of the educational\nhave-nots are in this region.\nA significant beginning in these areas might be made by providing\nrudimentary and inexpensive phonograph records and radios, perhaps as\npart of our foreign aid program. In this way, sound alone might be used"
