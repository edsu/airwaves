Fruit Valley Road\nVancouver, Washington 98660\nDear Mr. Palmer:\nYour letter dated February 29 to the Corporation for\nPublic Broadcasting has been responded to by an\nofficial of the Corporation. In addition, accopy of\nthe correspondence was routed to me for comment.\nNational Educational Radio is currently the principal\ndistributor of programs to educational radio stations\n^ in the United States. Our experience indicates that\nfew stations are interested in the type service you\nprovide.\nIn addition, the programs you listed are generally\navailable through a variety of means at limited cost.\nWhile the final decision is the Corporationâ€™s, my\njudgment is that there would be little support from\nnon-commercial stations to your proposed program\nservice.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM: lkl\ncc: Robert D. Swezey"
