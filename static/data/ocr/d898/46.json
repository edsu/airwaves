  "text": "March 3, 1969\nMEMORANDUM\nTO : Bob Mott\nFROM: James Fellows\nMore on the Sam Holt/CPB/Ford Radio Study: I support your\nfeeling that decision on its distribution (that is, by us)\nshould await your seeing a review copy.\nI am inclined to think that our criteria for determining\nwhether we wish to get involved in distributing it should\nbe whether it is a good or a bad study - not whether it\nis favorable or unfavorable. Any one of us could write\na study about radio that, with the facts at hand, could turn\nout to be favorable or unfavorable. How Holt has used the\nfacts is a matter of considerable concern to the radio\nbroadcasters in our group, and I would strongly urge that\nthis study not be kept as a house study for a privileged\nfew.\nAt a time when so much need exists for intelligent thought on\nall the topics we are asked to cope with as a profession,\nI think we should resist all efforts to withhold from the\nrank-and-file educational broadcaster those things that\nwill encourage him to think about his craft. It is an\noccupational hazard for the Washington set to treat studies\nlike this in a secretive and exlusive manner; the Title III\nstudy is being played close to the chest; unauthorized eyes\nmay never see the report of the Telecommunications Task\nForce; the papers prepared for the Carnegie Commission are\nhid somewhere, etc. If such behavior gives a few people\na sense of status, that seems to me its only value, and\nits not worth it.\nI hope that we'll be able to do something to liberate the\nradio studies so their analyses and perceptions - right\nor wrong - can be professionally shared with those who should\nhave them.\n-jAf\nJAF:cq\ncc:\nWilliam Harley"
