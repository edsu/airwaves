  "text": "Last year, more than half the money spent by\nstates and localities on public-school education\ncame from property taxes. In many communities,\nthis tax base is approaching the saturation point;\nhistorically, as a revenue source, it has been un¬\nresponsive to increases in national income.\nWhile elementary and secondary public-school\nenrollment has doubled since 1900, expenditures\nfor it have gone up more than seventy-fold. Since\n1950 alone, such expenditures have risen over\n150 per cent.\nWith present instructional methods, school\ncosts are likely to continue climbing along with\nenrollments. With television, the economic\nground-rules can be drastically altered.\nExperiment after experiment has shown that\nthe larger the number of students viewing a pro¬\ngram, the lower the per pupil cost. In one Mid¬\nwestern area, 30,000 pupils in 1,000 different\nclasses are being taught Spanish by an excep¬\ntionally talented teacher at a per-pupil cost of\nless than a penny a lesson. Directors of the Mid¬\nwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction\nestimate that if 1,000,000 pupils use the program\nthe first year, the cost of each child’s televised\neducation will be no more than $2. Eventually,\nthey hope to reduce the cost to 50 cents a child.\nOur success or failure with educational televi¬\nsion will have profound implications throughout\nthe world. Our partners in the Western alliance\nare also faced with the problem of educating\ntheir children with too few teachers and too few\nclassrooms. They, too, recognize the urgency of\ngetting better results for lower per-pupil costs.\nBut formidable as the educational problems of\nthe Western nations are, they are far outstripped\nby those of the developing areas of Asia and\nAfrica. Scarcely half the world’s 550 million\n8"
