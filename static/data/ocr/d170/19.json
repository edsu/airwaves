Since the recent purchase of\nthese hotels by the Sheraton Corporation, it is their plan to\nreplace all executive personnel with men already trained in\nSheraton methods of operational procedure.\nI feel that this-would be an ideal time for me to return\nto the communications field, inasmuch, as the move made now\nwill be a decisive and permanent one. I have been interested\nin the theory of educational television since its inception and\nthrough my good friend Ralph Steetle, have been interested and\ngratified to learn of the progress made so far in what I*\nbelieve to be a crucial step forward in bringing culture,\neducation and practical, benefits within reach of every American.\nVery truly yours,\n&/ Charles Warren\nDirector of Public Relations\nccs Graydon Ausraus"
