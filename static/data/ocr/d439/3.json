Milton Mayer is a distinguished authority on\nthe European scene, and the interviews he has brought back give a very\nhuman and personalized picture of present-day Europe.\n’’Listeners must be warned, however,\" Miss Waller adds, \"that most\nof the interviewees are speaking in a language other than their native\none, and that the recordings are necessarily slow-moving. The content\nof their messages will more than reward the attentive listening\ndemanded.\"\nTWO NBC “UNCLES” IN PARADE\nProminent in the August 16 parade in Morton Grove, Ill., sponsored\nby the Chamber of Commerce, will be Johnny Coons, WNBQ’s \"Uncle\nJohnny,\" and Norbert Locke, \"Uncle Ned\" of WMAQ’s Uncle Ned's Squadron.\nJohnny will be up to his usual antics, while \"Uncle Ned\" will\nsail gliders from the open convertible in which he will be riding.\n(8753)"
