During the\nsummer months, a member of the WUOM staff travelling in Eruope will\ncontact Mr. Acda and Mr. Kimball and will spend time with other\nbroadcasters in England, Prance, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. The\nchief purpose of these inquiries will be to dis cover program materials\nwhich do not duplicate current BPA offerings but may conceivably have\nequal appeal to NAEB members. In this area of programming, an\nadditional exchange of ideas and mutual support is urgently needed\nbetween the Acceptance Committee and the International Committee\nIn conclusion let me express my belief that the radio network\ncannot remain static. It must continue to seek out new materials,\nencourage greater participation among members, suggest new program\nformats, and be responsive not only to member's stated needs but those\nof the publics they serve. I sincerely hope that this is being done.\nE.G. Burrows\nChairman"
