I am delighted to learn\nthat you received the grant from the Fund for Adult\nEducation.\nYour study plans sound very interesting. I\nquite agree with you, we ‘'operators” need time in\nwhich to stop and think. That was one of the reasons\nI took a year off to get my Ph. D. in 1948-49. Now\nI feel the need to stop and think again, especially\nafter trying to keep up with the affairs of both\nNAEB and the University of Minnesota for the last\nyear and a quarter!\nI will discuss with Harry the matter of the\nchairmanship of the Research Committee and will get\nin touch with you in due course.\nYours sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBPsds\ncc: Harry Skornia"
