C.\nFebruary 8, 1960\nDr. Harry Skornia, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasting\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nV|B- 10:31 i12i\nDear Harry:\nMarshall was here Monday, the first, to discuss the project\nand the future of it. I believe I understood more than I have in\nthe past and hope I made myself understood by him, however, I suspect\nthat there is still no excess of understanding on either side.\nI am writing to determine what you have found out from the\nResearch Committee and what immediate action is to be proposed to\nthe Branch. My best understanding of Marshall's comments is that\n1) he has not met recently with the Committee; 2) that they may not\nin all cases fully appreciate the implications of the work (and this\nis said with no malice); 3) that he would be content to spend the\nremainder of the time in some limited but necessary travel and further\nwork on his formulations; and 4) that the end-product would be a _\nsyllabus plus some stated or deducible hypotheses amenable to experimental\ntesting.\nVie will look forward to hearing from you soon and hope that\nthe necessary questions can be easily resolved. Please let us know\nwhat we can do to assist in this.\nWarren F. Seibert\nSenior Research Coordinator\nEducational Media Branch"
