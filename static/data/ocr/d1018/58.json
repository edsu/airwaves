Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nSuite 119, DuPont Circle Office Building\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nI've been meaning to drop you a note for some time. Among\nother things, to thank you for your nice letter of notification\nof election to Radio Board chairman. It was appreciated.\nAlso, to express appreciation that you will be with us in San\nFrancisco next week. Only yesterday, we finally received a program\nand schedule of the WRTC. Somewhat to ray surprise, it is being\nheld at the Jack Tar. You will see that our Region VI meeting is\nscheduled there from 2:00 - 5:00 PM Thursday, February 22nd. I'll\nexpect to be there at least by noon on Thursday. Hope you and Lor¬\nen and I can have at least a short conflab before the merting\nbegins.\nFrom advance information, it looks like we'll have at least 50\n- of all categories - in attendance. Perhaps more. I hope, too,\nthere will be ’'curious*' non-members that will be good recruiting\nmaterial.\nWe have quite a number of suggestions for discussion topics -\nfar too many for a three-hour meeting. I'll have them extracted\nfor you to look over before the meeting begins. One that puzzles\nme, but might be meaningful to you, is\" \"Why did the NAEB file a\nprotest with the EBU at Rome on the report of Jack McBride?\"\nI have some other thoughts about NAEB that I hope we might\nhave an opportunity to talk over a bit in San Francisco. Am look¬\ning forward to seeing you there.\nSincerely,\nKK:mm\nRegion VI\n1 enclosure"
