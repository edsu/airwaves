Incidentally, you\nmight consider the desirability of sending copies of this letter\nto Ray Hurlburt.\nAt this time I am also returning the memorandum from the\nNational Academy of Sciences which you left with me. Needless\nto say, it creates a very substantial problem which you should\nfollow closely. Unfortunately, I have no words of wisdom to\ncontribute at this time.\nEnclosure"
