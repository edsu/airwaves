I\nfelt that these should be incorporated into what I already had\nto have as complete an end-product as possible.\nUnfortunately, they came at an inopportune tine, for my\nchange of position has kept me occupied most of the time these\npast few months. Now that we!re launched however, I’ve had a\nlittle more time and I’ve been able to bring the File Service\nup-to-date.\nNow is the time for the announcement in the Newsletter.\nI sincerely regret that we weren’t ready to get it in the\nSeptember issue as previsously planned.\nGale, I’ll rough out the article and try to get it to you\nby the early part of next week. I'll also send you the\ninformation on which I base the article so that you can make\nany changes desired.\nHarold, is there an issue of the Newsletter to come out\nbefore the Convention? If so, can we make the deadline? Call\nme, if necessary. Cedar 9-0342.\nIf we can’t get it into the Journal before convention\ntime is there a possibility of announcing the service and\nsampling opinion at the Convention itself?"
