Y.\nEXHIBIT-I-A\nDear __j\nThis is an important communication from your Regional Director of NAEB.\nurge you to give it your full and immediate attention.\nThe Board of Directors of NAEB, at a recent meeting ia New York City*\nvoted to allow the Executive Director and Director of Region V to pro¬\nceed with plans for a REGIONAL CONFERENCE in Region V. This conference\nuoulu be a pilot project0 If Region 7 get»to-gather is a success and\nmeets the needs of active members* other regional conferences may be\nheld in the future over the nation*\nAt the resent National Convention in Biloxi, only four of the eleven\nactive members of this region wore present. For Some time, I have con¬\ntended that the real strength of NAEB is in the regions and that we need\nREGIONAL CONFERENCES where we can discuss our mutual and special prob¬\nlems and thereby build a stronger national organisation.\nAt our conference, we would discus3 those things which YOU would want to\nbring out into the open; we would attempt to be mutually helpful.\nCertainly such a meeting would unite us in a commonness of purpose—a\nkeen realisation of just what, cur responsibilities are in this thing call¬\ned educational broadcasting. Last but not least, wo would get to know and\nrespect each other — something which ia sadly lacking in Region V*\nTho national office would be represented at this meeting and possibly a\ntop ranking consultant in educational broadcast!ng would be availablet.\nAn opportunity would be afforded all of you to learn more about the\nnational set-up of NAEB firsthand; ana the consultant would be an inspira¬\ntion for all of us. But in the main, the agenda for the two day meeting\nwould com© from YOU — regional members who actually work in educational\nradio. Everything would bo geared to your level of interest and needs.\nMore detailed information about the proposed REGIONAL CONFERENCE is en¬\nclosed. We used to know your reaction to the idea ofa REGIONAL CONFERENCE\nas well as certain other pertinent information by return mail.\nImmediate action is of the utmost importance.\nSincerely yours.\nJohn W. Dunn\nsene.\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
