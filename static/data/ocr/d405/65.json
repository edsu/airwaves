It is unfortunate that not\nall programs submitted can be selected for network\ndistribution. As only a limited number can bo chosen,\nevery effort is made to accept only those that are out¬\nstanding. I regret that the Network Acceptance Committee\nvoted against the acceptance of your proposed series\nchecked reasons:\nfor the following\nNot for network use—program material localized\nCould be presented as well by local stations\nRepeats material already presented by netv/ork\nMaterial or presentation not stimulating\nRecording quality not satisfactory\nPoorly organized\nIt is feared that series would lack listener interest\n. Voice quality dull\nNeither educational nor informative\nNot for an adult audience\nNothing original, unique, or different\nPoor script\nActing amateurish\nObviously read\nTiming bad—more or less than 29.29 or 15.29\nEie tape oubmitted oust be representative of the'aeriee, not an introduotbn\nThe committee sincerely hopes that you will submit\nother programs with better success.\nYour master tapes are being returned by headquarters\nunder separate cover.\nCordially yours.\nWaldo Abbot, Chairman\nNetwork Acceptance Committee\nNA3B"
