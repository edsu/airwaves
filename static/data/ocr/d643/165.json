Paulu reported on member\nradio station KoiAti' of Corvallis , Oregon. According to word\nreceived from representative James Morris» the chancellor of\nhigher education for the state of Oregon has suggested the\npossibility of selling radio station KOAC and using the proceeds\nto establish a TV station and the present operating budget for\noperation of a TV station. No one has made an official protest.\nPaulu questioned whether NAEB should act as an association of\nbroadcasters and point out the graveness and tragedy of such\na step. Bronson moved that* upon the advice and consent of\nthe NAEB member from Corvallis, President Paulu be instructed\nto write the university chancellor registering concern at\nsuch a possible action, etc. Adams seconded and approval\nwas unanimous.”\nI discussed this matter with Jimmie Morris at St. Louis\nand he said the time was not ripe for writing to Chancellor\nRichards. But on January 22 Jim wrote to Harry Skomla that\n”it will now be appropriate for the NAEB to release the\nresolution which you told me was passed at the St. Louis\nmeeting. If you want to send it to me I will see that it\ngoes to Chancellor Richards.”\nHarry pointed out in his reply to Morris (January 28),\nthat we did not pass a resolution, but did authorize me to\nwrite to the Chancellor."
