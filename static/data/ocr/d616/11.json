They are used for afternoon\nconcerts and dancing in various institutions. These uses\nraise parallels which must be conceded to have a bearing on\nthe question, because the radio stations are an extension of\nthe institutions* educational work. In churches a similar set\nof uses could be cited. I wonder if it doesnU become rather\ninvolved to try to draw defining lines?\nIn general our member stations strive to avoid abuses\nof the kind you are trying to prevent, particularly that of\nplaying new records to death. Our stations play very little\npopular music, and confine their interests largely to serious\nmusic* There is ample evidence that the playing of these\nrecords on the air raises the standard of appreciation and so\nincreases the demand for them. Your dealers in the home cities\nof educational stations can attest to that, I feel sure.\nPresident, HAEB"
