It began oper¬\nations September 1 with the appointment of Merritt C. Ludwig (full-time) as research\ndirector, and Martin Fritz (one-fourth-time) as psychologist.\nIn the period since September 1, the research staff has been doing the follow¬\ning things:\n1. Planning the overall research operations\n2. Developing and testing measurement techniques\n3* Planning and carrying out a large-scale basic survey of WOI-TV audience\nResearch Objectives\nThe general objective is to measure program effectiveness. We have divided\nthe task into three kinds of measurement:\n1. To measure on a continuing basis the audience size and characteristics of the\nF.A.E. discussion programs. How many and what kinds of people view the programs?\n2. To measure on a continuing basis audience reaction to the programs? What\ndo people like and dislike about the programs and why?\n3. To measure the direct and indirect effects of viewing the programs. Do\nthe programs attract and hold viewer interest? Do they stimulate interest in the\nprogram subject matter? Do they teach factual information? Do they develop\nattitudes and opinions with respect to current issues? Do the programs lead to\nthought, discussion, decision, and action?"
