Same as me.\nVery possibly, . 0\nNy name8 s Hawkins, I don8t believe I caught your name.\nTocqueville.\nSounds foreign! course, you said you were foreigners, Dutch name?\nFrom France.\nBlame me, that11 s what you said. Don8t believe I caught your name, sir,\neither,\nname is Beaumont,\nThat sounds foreign,,.wait, you told me. Swedish name?\nAlso French.\nWell, that9s refreshing. I°m certainly honoured to make the acquain¬\ntance! now what can I do for you?\nWhy are all those men killing all those dogs?\nWhy, they0 re the city dog killers: what else would you expect them to do?\nThis then is their job?\nAround here there are too many dogs; they just run wild in the streets.\nYou got to do something about them. Usually we got to kill off four\nor five thousand in a year. In the hot weather, they8re knocking them\ndown at the rate of three hundred a day.\nBut it is so cruel| look sometimes, the animals are only maimed,\nI guess it is, but what else would you suggest? X wouldn8t do the job\nmyself! I don°t like getting blood all over me. But 1811 tell you this:\nthe job°s got to be done! and we Americans don°t like anybody criticising\nanything that we reckon we ought to do. Least of all, Italians, and Portu¬\nguese and foreigners generally. So I think you°d find it wise to remember\nthat, and not be so free with your unwarranted accusations. Give you good\nday."
