You will\nrecall I pointed this out at the time of your long distance\ncall about three weeks ago.\nI suppose your dropping the reins of NAEB only means that\nyou will be redoubling your efforts at home base and that\nthere will not really be any interval for deserved relaxa¬\ntion. However, if you should have a moment when you would\nhave time for passing along any observations you would care\nto make on the recent convention, or any other NAEB matters\nof mutual interest, I would very much appreciate hearing\nfrom you.\nLet me say that I have thoroughly enjoyed our relationship\nduring your term as NAEB president, and I hope we will keep\nup personal contact on matters of unofficial, if not\nofficial business.\nMy very best."
