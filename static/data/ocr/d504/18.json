Study of the regulations of \"Let The Peoples Sing 1972\" and\nProposals for amendments\nThe delegates examined the 1971 regulations article by article.\nThey felt it would be appropriate to include in the draft to be sub¬\nmitted to the committee for approval, amendments relative to the intro¬\nduction of the German language (in addition to English and French).\nThis will now read in text \"Instructions on the possible method of\nVocal and Musical production other than orthodox musical terms and\ntranslations into either English, French or German of the words of\neach song where these are not already in one or other of those languages\nSuch amendment was proposed in view of the fact that in coun¬\ntries where the organizations are affiliated to OIRT, German is the\nmost used foreign language.\nStill in the spirit of opening up to other unions in the rest\nof the world it was proposed that in the chapter \"organization\" of the\nregulations, recordings could be judged by an international jury in a\nradio centre suitable for such an operation and not, as up till now,\nin a European Centre.\nIn the clause \"Classes of entry and awards\" it was proposed that\n- bona fide school choirs should be made up of pupils of the\nsame school;\n- young people’s choirs should no longer be subject to the\nparagraph which limits the number of members under nineteen\nto 75% of the total."
