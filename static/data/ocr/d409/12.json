I appreciate your sug¬\ngestion that more consideration be given to television as a\npossibly cheaper way of providing ’’transportation” of some of\nthe audio-visual he terials.\nYou state that you are very better informed about radio and\ntelevision departments than about audio-visual ones. This is\none of the reasons why the rough draft of brochure No. h was\nsent to you. Most of us knovT very little about radio and\ntelevision departments, and we thought that this brochure,\nwhich will go out to many college and university presidents\nand deans, should cover facilities for radio and television,\nas well as for other audio-visual departments. I had hoped\nthat we could fill in somewhat in detail coverage in these\nareas. For this reason, I would certainly like to have you\ncontinue to ’’react.”\nFLORENCE IH-CHI FAN\nAdministrative Assistant Sincerely yours.\nMARY C. WELCH\nAdministrative Assistant\nAnna L. Hyer\nDirector of Studies\nALHtMMS"
