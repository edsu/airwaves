Dr. Malone provided the raw material to make him so, while\nMilton Geiger and Morton Wishengrad,wrote the lines that made Jefferson\ncome alive again. Frank Papp produced and directed the series, with\nmusic composed and conducted by Wladimir Selinsky.\nAll of the episodes have been authentic in historical spirit\nand imaginative in form. Against a background of some of the most\ninspirational chapters of our nation's story, the programs have sought\nto dramatize ideas which are the enduring possessions of all Americans,\nall free peoples."
