  "text": "Re the Tape Repository matter, I think our stand should be —\nWe can not release grant-in-aid, big four, or any other series we may have\na special interest in because of plans for possible future exploitation.\nWe cannot release other programs contributed by members or other organizations\nbecause we are not authorized. DAVI will have to deal directly with\nthe producers.\nWe should sic the School program people on this — get them to contact# school\nprogram producers individually not to support the Repository. I think\nthey may already have done this to some extent.\nFinancially &ack a number of school series, say 3 or 4 full year series, for\nthe next several years. These programs to be released only through NAEB.\nIt always comes back to money.\n*n the meantime, the Repository may kill itself through issuing an undiscriminating\ncatalog. This seems to be one of the principal dangers both to the Repository\nand to NAEB, according to the School Committee — that the quality of product\noffered by the Repository will discredit this type of broadcasting and teaching.\nThe Committee finds almost no acceptable school series for national distribution,\nand it^is extremely doubtful that the DAVI material is any good. The problem is\nnot merely to beat stiff competition, but to survive the harm the competition\nmay do to the field of school program broadcasting.\nObviously my feelings on this have been formed through conversation with the\nSchool Committee. If every school broadcaster felt (or feels) as the\ncommittee members do, we'd have no problem."
