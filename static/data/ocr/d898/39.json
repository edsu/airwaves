C. 20036\nDear Mr* Macys\nDon Quayle of your staff made two excellent present¬\nations on behalf of the Corporation for Public Broad¬\ncasting at the Western Radio and Television Association\nConference in Seattle, on February 27 and 28.\nHis Friday morning report to the full convention was\nexceptionally well prepared and provided detailed infor¬\nmation of major interest to the radio and television\nstation managers and their staffs.\nPreviously, Don had met with about 25 radio station\nmanagers from the thirteen western states in an informal\nsession to report on radio* The reaction to this pre¬\nsentation was highly complimentary.\nMany of the radio station managers were absent from the\nNAEB Convention in Washington, D. C*, in November, 1968.\nThus, for them it was their first opportunity to hear\na member of the Corporation staff comment on educational\nradio.\nThere has been a feeling that CPB activity in public\nradio has lagged behind public television. Those who\nunderstand realize that, if this is the case, it re¬\nsults from the decision to engage in the two public\nradio studies (the Miller research and hhe Samuel Holt\nproject) that are now completed.\nDon did a superior job of updating CPB«s radio role and\nof projecting future activities. X know the radio per¬\nsonnel attending WRTA were pleased*\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAMslkl\nccj William G. Harley"
