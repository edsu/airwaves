Harley\nPresident - NASB\nHI9-21 DuPont Circle Building\n1346 Connecticut NW\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bill*\nOn the phone this morning, Harold said that after much discussion re\npublications, y*all (If3n practicing for Texas) have decided to drop\nthe Washington Report and to leave the Newsletter to be written, type¬\nset, andpriirtedvra letterpress out here, and possibly to be mailed\nfirst-class to Institutional members.\nHe also suggested that I write you regarding \"Jazzing up* the NL.\nSfence it is a lot easier to discuss this sort of thing in person,\nI wonder If we might get together—with Harold and Jim—for a short\ntalk in Austin. I know you*re not apt to have any free time, but\nmaybe we could steal a few minutes from somewhere.\nThere are all sorts of ways of Jazzing up the format, of course.\nProbably the first thing we have to decide, though, is Just what wefre\ntrying to do. If the primary purpose of the NL is to transmit assoc¬\niation news and news of the field to readers {which is my idea of the\nNL#a purpose), then flexibility is most important* It would not be\nwise to go to a magazine style with layouts planned in advance, in\ndifferent line lengths and different type sizes—because a late-break¬\ning story would destroy the whole thing.\nTaking everything into consideration that I can think of, I wotld re¬\ncommend the addition of another color in one standard place for each\nissue. (This could be preprinted at an additional cost of about |25\nper Issue, if done in lots of 10,000 or more.)\nWe can add pictures, when they have meaning, and when they are available,\nI at a cost for engravings of about #3*70 for thumbnail size, about\n4.80 for 3x4~tnoh size, etc. This, by the way, is not out of line\nwith halftone negatives for photographs if we printed offset—which\nwould run about |3 to $5 eacho)\nWe can re-design the head into something more dramatic."
