Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nIndiana University\nBloomington, Indiana\nDear Bromo:\nThe minutes of your committee seem to about cover the ground.\nYou’re right, I believe, in capsulizing what transpired, because\nthis makes the minutes much easier to read.\nOne member of your committee who was there is really an outstand¬\ning guy but probably didn’t say much because he is new - that's\nTom Petry. I suspect we'll have really great things out of him, in\nmany ways, as time goes by.\nI would suggest that you pass along, in a letter, to Harley the\ncommittee recommendation re a full-time PR person. This way it\ngets into the record properly.\nIt was good to see you and Dortha again. I hope that I can drop\nin to see you two sometime during my ventures back into the wonder¬\nful midwest.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President\nCC: Mrs. Betty McKenzie\nEnc. 1\nHEH:kip"
