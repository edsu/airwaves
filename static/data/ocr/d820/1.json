Crosby, President\nCrosby Laboratories, Inc.\nBax 233, Bobbins Lane\nHicksvllle, New York\nDear Mr. Crosby:\nThank you for your letter of November 22 and the reprint of your article on\n\"FM Multiplexing.”\nI wrote because one of the Directors of NAEB thought that, by the use of\nmultiplexing on some of our educational FM stations, it might be possible\nto create an educational FM network. This might replace, or at least sup¬\nplement, the NAEB tape network for the distribution of programs in areas\nwhere there would be sufficient signal strength for networking. Re felt,\nthat by the use of multiplex it would also be possible to transmit one\nprogram locally and still repeat the network program to another station.\nI believe that the cost of multiplexing equipment would also be a deter¬\nrent to its use by educational stations since Mr. Cculton estimated the\nmultiplexing equipment might cost $$000 per station with another $2000\nfor test equipment. He would not estimate the cost of receiving equip¬\nment.\nSince there are problems still to be solved as far as multiplexing is con¬\ncerned, it might be better for us to survey the possibility of an FM net¬\nwork using existing facilities. If this proved workable and there was need\nfor multiplexing, then we could proceed from this accomplishuent. I can\nsee that there would be problems of programming and coordination to be\nsolved in addition to technical ones.\nIf you would care to make further comments on the basis of this additional\ninformation, I should be happy to have them.\nThank you for your interest.\nYours very truly,\nCecil S. Bidlack\nTelevision Engineer\nCSBtcp\nCopy to Carl lfenzer-WSUI"
