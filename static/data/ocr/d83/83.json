Have been very busy final¬\nizing the project, so things have been a bit of a rush.\nTo the best of my knowledge, and as of June 30th, the\ninvoices enclosed close our accounts—with the exception of\na local bill for telephone service from the Bell Telephone\nand St. Michael*s College (not enclosed). I called each account\nto obtain the final figure, so if you receive further invoices\nfrom the project vould suggest you check to make sure they are\nnot duplications. If Prof. McLuhan plans to use the equipment\nfor further project purposes that would be another matter, of\ncourse.\nAs I will not be in the office, Rose, would you please\nsend your cheques directly to the accounts? Will the enclosed\nenvelopes facilitate things a bit?\nShall be very happy to continue our correspondence, Rose.\nIt has been very pleasant, and certainly the end of the project\nneed not sever connections. 1*11 be visiting some friends in\nMaine and will send you a card from there. Perhaps later a few\npictures, since I’m a confirmed camera bug!\nAgain, best wishes for a most pleasant summer, Rose, and\nthank you for all your wonderful help. Shall write...\nAfterthought:\nBy the way...regarding the cheques, please add current\nexchange, and if possible show the addition somewhere on the cheques.\nSome of the accounts have difficulty recognizing the amounts—forgetting\nexchange has been included. Would this be too much trouble?\nSincerely,\nR."
