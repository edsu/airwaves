The committee will encourage local communities or local organizations\ninterested in Educational Television to make the effort to apply\nfor the Educational Television channels reserved for them by the\nFederal Communications Commission,\n2. The committee favors legislation which would\n2.1 Provide financial support from State funds for the\nengineering survey and legal assistance necessary to\nmake application for a channel providing such support\nis requested by the local community or community Edu¬\ncational Television organization.\n2.2 Make it possible for local school districts and county\nsuperintendents to spend tax monies for Educational\nTelevision, the use of such funds not to be restricted\nto educational nonprofit stations but to include com¬\nmercial stations offering educational services.\n3. The committee feels that Educational Television stations should be\nlocally controlled, operated and programmed, and sees its function as\nthat of assisting local stations to comprehend the problems involved\nand providing them with advice and help necessary to solve these\nproblems."
