It is in the classroom teacher's face-to-face\nrelationship with the individual pupils that the television lesson's poten¬\ntial for learning is realized. Conversely, this potential can fade with\nthe image on screen when this relationship is absent.\nFilm Synopsis\nThe development of an instructional television program goes\nthrough many stages. Much work needs to be done in the selection and\nevaluation of the material for the lesson before the actual studio pro¬\nduction can begin.\nThe film in this kit traces the preparation of an instructional\ntelevision lesson in its latter stages. For the purpose of this film it is\nassumed that the lesson ideas have been developed and evaluated in light\nof specific classroom needs, and that the Teacher's Guide to accompany\nthe programs has been prepared.\nThe film opens with the beginning of the lesson on a television\nscreen. The setting is an underwater viMage on the Continental Shelf.\nInto this scene, comes a diving saucer invented by man to help him ex¬\nplore the ocean's depths.\nD-4"
