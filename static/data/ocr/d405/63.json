Commentary is bright\nand keeps the show moving at a brisk pace. Not at all sure,\nhowever, of the teaching effectiveness of singing historical\ncommercials but think the show is well enough done to give\nit a try anyway. Yes.\nTHE PLAYROOM: Had to force myself to listen to this\none. Idea, production techniques lack freshness and indeed\nare distracting in some places. Music under narrator was.\nmaintained on a very disturbing level. Don't think the kids\nwould like it either. No.\nTO MAKE MEN FREE: Liked this particular shorn very\nmuch. Thought the script and production were of a high level.\nI wonder, however, whether or not stories of the exploits.of\nthe Detroit and oth. r Michigan outfits in the Civil War might\nhave a rather local appeal. In this case, I will vote yes\nbut feel that all member stations should be fully advised of\nthe program content if it is offered to the network.\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nIt\nC\nL'hC (3 isoD\n»• In p\n?|8|9|ip|ll|l,2,l|2|3|4|5!e"
