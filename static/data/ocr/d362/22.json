Hull\nFROM: Harry Skornia\nHerewith, as pulled together by Harold Hill (with minor modifications made in\ndiscussion together yesterday) is the minimal Budget proposal promised you,\nfor discussion with Kellogg.\nIt will be noted that it would involve $60,000.00 from Kellogg, on a diminishing\n30-20- 10-thousand dollar basis for three years. 'Whether without Ford funds,\nour “other income** can be increased, as indicated, is far from a certainty.\nHowever, I believe we have no alternative but to work at it.\nH you have any ideas to include before we finalise this, let me know as quickly\nas possible.\n1*U hope to get into the mail also, before 1 hnnettoday, a second draft of a\nProfessional Advancement proposal — which combines the two sent yesterday.\nHJSsjg\n£nc."
