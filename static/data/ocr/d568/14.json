  "text": "NAEB Options\n-2\nPROS AND CONS\nOption A - Independent NAEB\nPros:\n1. Maintains its freedom and independence as a corporation\nwith an elected board including professionals that have\ncomplete control of its budget, policies, and staff.\n2. Serve its members, now that stations were out, without\nmanagement-labor conflict problem that has always caused\nsome difficulty.\n3. Continue to speak out as an independent voice to Congres\nthe FCC; continue to maintain membership in EMC, JCET,\n\"EBU, UNESCO, etc. and provide input in these and other\narenas of influence affecting our interests.\n4. Be able to serve as the conscience of the industry,\nraising questions or criticizing CPB or TOP if indicated\n5. Be free to pursue concerns related to the overall\nbenefit of the field without domination by TV Trade\nAssociation: Telecommunications, for example.\n6. Maintain uninterrupted performance of function and\npreservation of staff. Merge later if independent\noperation doesn't work out.\nCons:\n1. Without ETV stations, NAEB has questionable viability\nor at least continued activity at rather low and\ninconsequential level. An independent voice, but is\nanybody listening?\n2. Puts NAEB in an outside-looking-in situation - removed\nfrom direct connection with power structure in public\nbroadcasting.\n3. Independent operation means devoting high proportion\nof scarce funds to housing, office machinery, etc., as\nwell as for duplicated services and redundant activities\nand staff. NAEB could end up as just one of hundreds of\nlittle association activities in Washington, existing as\nmarginal operations of enormous insignificance."
