Komulo, enclosing a copy of\nFrank's letter inviting us to attend the World Brotherhood Conference\non January 9, 10 and 11,\nHow do you feel about this? Certainly there are some very\ndistinguished sponsors for this meeting - I doubt if we ever will\nfind any more distinguished ones. The meetings themselves may be\ninteresting and worthwhile. Yet there is the question of whether this\nis close enough to our major area of interest to you or me taking\nthe time to attend.\nI am inclined to refuse with thanks, saving my time for H&EB\nmeetings and problems, Do you want to go? Should we send one of\nour New York members?' Someone else? Or no one? I*m cold to this â€”\nbut maybe overlooking something.\nSuggestions pleaseI\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nDirector Region k\nFrank Schooley"
