Hill,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Ill.\nnaeb headquarters\nNOV 1 9 1959\nDear Harold:\ni\nAt the recent seminar in Washington, under ASCD\nauspices, a sheet was distributed concerning \"Policy\nGoverning Allowances for Equipment Costs\".\nThe statement of policy is not unambiguous, but\nI read it to say that 1fthe allowance may not exceed\n20$ of the undepreciated value per year1’. This means\nthat it is impossible for me to rent a typewriter.\nThe used IBM machine that we have, worth about $500\nnew, we rent at the student rate of $15.00 a month.\nEven on a ten month basis this exceeds the 20$ allow¬\nance and such is the case with the rest of our equip¬\nment. Please advise.\nShall heed your admonitions concerning the en¬\nclosure of receipts for travel expenses, etc. When\nin New York or some other cities, I stay with friends\nwhose hospitality I return by gifts of various kinds.\nYour regimen indicates that I abandon the hospitality\nof friends in favour of hotels in order that I shall\nhave receipts to send you. Perhaps it is possible to\ndevise a means of accommodation in this matter?\nAt the memorable Washington seminar, Harry made\na mighty impact and I do not think it will rub out.\nPlease give him two copies of the enclosed from the\nChristian Science Monitor.\nBest regards.\nfyutrshrtJi\nhmm/rn\nEnclosures"
