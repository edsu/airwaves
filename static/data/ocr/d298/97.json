In sound broad¬\ncasting a microphone changes sound\nwaves into electrical impulses; then at\na distance a loudspeaker changes the\nelectrical impulses back into sound.\nIn facsimile broadcasting the scanner\ntakes the place of the microphone and\nthe recorder takes the place of the\nloudspeaker.\nWith facsimile, the copy is wrapped\naround a revolving drum in the sta¬\ntion.' A scanner—an electric eye—\nchanges each grade of black into an\nelectrical impulse, which is broadcast.\nIn the home this electrical impulse is\npicked up by an ordinary radio re¬\nceiver and relayed to a' facsimile re- '\ncorder. ^ -t\nStatic Interferes.\nA roll of paper which has bedn\nchemically treated to make it sensi¬\ntive to electrical impulses'' feeds \\\nthrough the recorder. The impulses j\nturn the paper black' and thus repro- j\nduce the original copy. Static blurs and j\nblackens the reproduction. FM (fre- j\nquency modulation) channels are freer\nfrom static than AM (amplitude mod¬\nulation) channel^. For this reason\nfacsimile newspapers will be broad¬\ncast over FM stations to FM sets ex¬\nclusively.\nAccording to ,man# persons facsim¬\nile newspapers have been “just over\nthe horizon’’ for 20 years. However,\nfor a variety of reasons they are just\nnow being developed. , The rapid ex¬\npansion of FM stations'and improve¬\nments in the sensitizing of paper after\nWorld War II have given * facsimile\nnewspapers a big push.\nAn early facsimile receiver."
