Skornia, Executive Director,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrban*, XUinois\nDear Doctor Skornia,\nTour letter of January 2 was shared by a number of us at Motorola and\n1 thank you for it. Its message was reassuring; it gave promise of\naction in areas that need development.\nNews releases of the past few weeks on the proposals for federal aid to\neducation have been disturbing. No mention is being made of the use of\ntelevision or radio as aids in making up for lost time in certain subject\nareas. Instead, an i nadequale and slow moving program of scholarships\nhas been suggested. This to my thinking, is like going back to the horse\nand buggy for transportation at a time when we hare jet planes at our\ndisposal.\nIn following the accounts of business conducted by the Association of\nAmerican Colleges in its meeting in Miami last week, there was\nadditional disappointment. Apparently the time given over to the bitter\ndebate on federal aid precluded any significant consideration of the use\nof new methods for instruction.\nThese situations do bother me; and I am certain they are cause for comment\nand concern by people like you. In a country familiar with the techniques\nof heavy voiced lobbies 1 am wondering whether the individual voices of\nNAJEB, JCET, CET, and the E1A { Our own industrial group - formerly\nRJCTMAi have been heard at all!\n4141 W.
