Slack and Mix vote\n\"no;\" Westbrook votes yes.\n2. Views of Slack and Mix are already known to other people\ninvolved*\n3* Westbrookfe reasons are as follows:\n1) I vote yes mainly on the theory that \"what happens\nanywhere else*....etc.\"\n2) While comparisons with past programming and similar\nefforts is not completely valid, I do think there is\nsome value in making such comparisons. In this case,\nI think the program is equally as valid and as well\ndone as other series offered on the net. It is in¬\nfinitely superior to a number of other \"grant\" series*\n3) Expanding reason number one, with a somewhat different\nangle—I think that, while the program is somewhat lo¬\ncalized, there are some lessons to be gained by people\nin other parts of the country."
