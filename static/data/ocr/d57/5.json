I would like to hear, for Instance, what Mr. William\nPolye of Bendlx Aviation has to say about Physics or Fred\nCongleton of the Ford Motor Company on Industrial Engineering.\nJudging from the opening program, I am probably unduly optimistic,\nbut would feel better about having given the series a fair\nhearing if one of these later programs had been submitted.\nBut even then, there's that recording quality problem. I think\nthe network should suggest to Falrleigh Dickinson U that it should\nbuy something better than a Webster Chicago if it's going into the\nbroadcast business."
