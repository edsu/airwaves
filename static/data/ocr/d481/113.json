Harley\nPresident, NAEB\n13^6 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington 6\nD.C.\nDear Bills\nThis refers to your communication of January 24 directed to\nNAEB Board Members regarding NAEEWJCETMJETRC relations.\nCongratulations on a start toward a mutual understanding of\nNAEB and NETBC functions. I think we *ve needed this for a\ngood long time.\nOne thing disturbs me: Page 2, next to the last paragraph,\n3* Station Activation\nPrimary responsibility for activation of additional\neducational stations, methods of interconnection thereof,\nand new patterns of program distribution will rest with\nthe Center.\nDoes this mean that NAEB will not concern itself with the\nactivation of new educational stations, either radio or TV,\nor with such things as networks, for either radio or TV,\ninvolving such things as wire line, PM or microwave relay?\nI think these things could be extremely important, NABB has\ndone considerable pioneering, and I*d hate to see it given\nup.\nSincerely,\nCarl H. Menzer\nDirector\n/\nCM:hm"
