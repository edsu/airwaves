Contacts began to be so frequent\nand firm that I felt acme concessions were necessary, if the NAEB’s name\nware not to be said for future possible contracts.\nAfter seeing you, Warren outlined how they saw the future of this project,\nas, via. that you would \"spend the remainder of the time in some limited\nbut necessary travel and further work can your formulationsj and that the\nend-product would be a syllabus plus some stated or deducible hypotheses\namenable to experimental testing.\"\nI hope the revisions suggested will be agreed to. I tried to hold the\nline as much as possible — and may have to \"give\" a little more. If so,\nyou might help by suggesting where.\nBest wishes from us all.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nPresident\nHJStjp"
