Much of the equipment used\nin the repair shops and at the transmitter comes within the\nbudget of the vocational department. The four teachers who\ndirect the radio work are paid as are all teachers, from\nthat particular budget. The radio supplies, such as tapes\nare not particularly limited. So far it has been simply a\nmatter of asking for what is really needed, with the mutual\nunderstanding that we must ask for as little as we can\npossibly get by with. Radio equipment is purchased by funds\nset aside, by law, I think, for building improvement. For\nexample the original expenditures were a part of a bond issue\nfor vocational class Instruction. There are two vocational\nclasses in radio (engineering, repair etc.) and one vocational\nclass in programming and station operation. We know that we\nare operating on a shoe string. But in time our funds may\nincrease."
