These men and women\nare faced with a new means of instruction which is perhaps the most exciting\nand revolutionary since the introduction of the text book. It is vitally impor¬\ntant that they learn the unique meanings and grammars of these new media if\nthey are to know how best to use them. Misused, they can endanger our entire\neducational system. Well and responsibly used, television and radio show\npromise of being very beneficial in the solution of many of the critical problems\nracing education today. This is an area of professional training, in far more\nthan techniques or “gadget-orientation/' the surface of which has barely been\nscratched# The NAEB has so far conducted two seminars in an effort to begin\nto get at this problem, and to begin to find solutions. We hope to be able to\ncontinue, and expand, our activities in this important area."
