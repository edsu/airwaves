Rupp\nNo\nI must say that I don't believe the experience and training of Mr. Rupp\nqualifies him for what we have a right to expect from a Radio-TV researcher.\n1 believe he should have applied under some other classification. Apparently\nmany new people now see ETV as an area needing lots of outside experts. This\nmay be. But I believe they should secure minimum qualifications in radio\nand TV educationally first. I believe the French would resent, as presumptive,\nhis proposed project, except in the hands of a qualified communications-tralned\nexpert. I believe he should apply in language teaching, in which his TV experience\nshould be most valuable.\nI <1> Dallas W. Smythe\nYes\nI believe he has the qualifications to command respect of the French\nfor the research he proposes. Excellently qualified in all respects. I\npersonally know how hard he is working on his French, also.\nI (2) Robert E. Summers\nYes\nA very promising young scholar. I wish he were stronger in French.\nWould rate him immediately behind Dallas Smythe and ahead of Jordan. If the\nFrench indicate preference for producers over research scholars, Mr. Jordan\nwould rate first.\n1-B Richard H. Albitz\nYes\nDo not know him personally, except by correspondence. His name is\nwell known to many educational radio-TV people. Well qualified. Very good\nproject."
