To explain the need for the proposed convention, which\nwill primarily benefit developing countries, I have prepared an\n(-■—) explanatory memorandum which I also enclose and which you may wish\nto distribute to ABU members.\nI am taking the same steps with ESU members, since without\nthe support of a large number of governments the proposed convention\nwin not see the light very soon and thus, yet again, technology will\nhave developed a splendid medium of communication which, for legal\nreasons, cannot be fully exploited.\nI therefore count on your full cooperation.\nWith kind regards.\nYours sincerely,\nr Lj\nG.
