Associate (produc¬\ntion centers). Affiliate (organizations active in the field but not qualifying\nfor active or associate membership), and Individual Membership is shown\nin tabular form in Appendix A.

The decrease in affiliates is due to the transfer of individuals\nto the new individual member category in a reclassification of membership,\neffective this year. All members except Honorary and Individual are now\ninstitutions.\nThe Honorary Memberships remained at three: two former Federal\nCommunications Commission Chairmen, whose efforts were in large part respon\nsible for the allocation and preservation of frequencies in the spectrum for\nETV and educational FM stations; and the former educational and public service"
