Eight\ngreat obligations of citizenship are discussed: (1)\nUnderstand the American way of life and what makes\nit tick; (2) Understand Communism; (3) Understand\nSocialism; (4) Understand propaganda techniques\nused by both the Communists and Socialists; (5) Take\nan interest in your public schools and the private and\npublic-financed colleges; (6) Become active in govern¬\nment; (7) Strive constantly for Spiritual growth; (8)\nDedicate a part of your everyday life to bringing these\nobligations of citizenship to the attention of other\npeople. Within the substance of these discussions are\nreviews of the preceding 12 films.\nLeft: This final film brings a review of\nall the lessons learned from the series,\nand ends with a challenging eight-point\nlist (above) of American citizenship\nobligations."
