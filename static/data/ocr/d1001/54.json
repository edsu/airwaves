PROGRAM DIRECTOR\nMr* John Holt\nNAEB Tape Manager\nGregory Hall\nUrban a, Illinois\nDear John:\nam\nOCTltK&j\nl Tm not supposed to vote upon the various sub¬\nmissions but it seems to me there are quite a number that\ndonft have an adequate vote upon them at the present time.\nSo, I’ll take the liberty of putting in a few votes which\nmay settle up some of these programs*\nI would vote in favor of the WINDOW IN THE\nWORLD. In favor of the COOPER UNION series. In favor of\nthe TALES OF THE VALIANT neces s a ri Iy * In favor of the\nWORLD OF ATOMIC ENERGY. fn favor of the UNESCO gift.\nAccording to my records most of these have\nbut one vote, so it may help to get a second vote in, although\nI think it is up to the committee to really decide and not\nto me. According to my records there are still about 20\nprograms which are still hanging in the air, although it may\nbe that I don’t get the votes that are cast upon all of these.\nSo if the favorable votes are of any value go ahead and use\nthem.\nSee you in Chicago.\nCordial Iy you rs,\nCtLtZjJlo\nWaldo Abbot\nDirector of Broadcasting\nWA :mv"
