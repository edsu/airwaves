Chew, you have been appearing in the\nletter3 to t.e editor column of the Asahi, so suppose we\nstart by asking you to summarise the advantages of Romaniza -\ntion, and perhaps to read your letter.\nWhat do you advocate? What do linguistic scientists think\nwill happen?\nYou were speaking of the \" stylized symbol\" ...a picture for\nevery word, now what will this system do to replace this\nmethod,\nA general question: there are many social nuances in Japanese\nowing to the still somewhat feudal character of its aristo¬\ncrat- c society, A well educated Japanese is often un¬\ncomfortable until he knows the exact social position of the\nperson he is talking to. Give us an example of the \" language\nof high feeling\". Of the workersfs good morning. What does\ndomo arigato gozaimas actually mean? And sayonara? Does\nthis allow room for wit and humor... we take it there is\nmuch verbal play, double entendre in Japanese.\nMany thanks, John Chew, director of the Japanese Language-\nField School of the Foreign Service Institute in Tokyo. Thir\nis John Lerch in Tokyo bidding you Sayonara until next week\nat this time.\nSpjMPHHP\nTape recorded each week in Tokyo, REPORT FROM JAPAN is\nwritten and produces by John Lerch.\n-END-"
