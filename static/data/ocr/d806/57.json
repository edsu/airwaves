After rather lengthy discussion\nwith the Committee, I would suggest that Mr, Probst b© paid #2,^00.00\nand Mr, Siegel $1,500.00, a total of $U,000o00. This represents one®\nhalf the amount Mr, William Harley would have received for this same\nperiod, and the work supervised by Mr, Probst and Mr, Siegel amounts\nto approximately half the work done by Mr® Harley. The division of\nthe $*,000.00 between the two men, as suggested above, is an approxlma\ntion of the relative amount of work don© by the two.\nI trust you will give, this suggestion your consideration and take\nsuch steps as to you may seem, appropriate.\nMy kindest regards.\nSincerely yours.\nGA:bc\nGrsydon Ausmus\nPresident, NAEB"
