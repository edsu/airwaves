At first glance he seems to have been inconsistent on the subject\nof the press. While he was in the absolute monarchy of France, before the French\nRevolution, he had this to say about his own country: \"The basis of our govern¬\nments being the opinion of the people, the first object should be to keep that\nright; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government with¬\nout newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment\nto prefer the latter.\" He qualified this extravagant utterance by adding that \"ev¬\nery man should receive these papers, and be capable of reading them.\" That is, the\nenlightenment of the people in public matters seemed even more important that the\ninstitutions of government, since the latter had been created by the people and\ncould be created again.
