But if you’d be interested—-and\nfeel the experience and contacts would be useful, we shall at one© write\nGilliercn to see if attendance by a non-specialist observer (as I would\nbe myself if I were there) would be desirable. This would depend on\nwhere you expect to be—-and what dates are. See copy of my attached\nletter to him.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skarnia\nPresident\nHJStkh\nCC» Dr. Keith Engar\nMr. William Harley\nDr. Samuel Becker\nEnclosure"
