In virtually all such instance® Bob said b® didn't roan to ha\nhard on m* that he knew X mm91 to bl®©* ate.* but X got $he i^resslon that\nwe, and by ncsas \"the Board\" \"afcould got on the MU* bsffers attaittlng further\nrequests, .in © on e \"cafeteria*\" year-to-year basis*;©ad lay out a plan.\nSfe'r© apparently now t&sro m mm a year ago* eto.? ato.

He also was wry mm in his praise of the toy he has bean kept informed this\nyear.\nIf m can take the Initiative and get the FAE (and perhaps Ford (MoPeek) * as\nthe FAB my decide)* Kellogg and the BTRC •together* Kellogg would be pleased.\nFan Duya's bosses don't feel should take the Initiative. Ha asked if other\norganisation® (JGBT* eto.) ahouldn't be Included* I felt rot* (with the possible\nexception of KPAG* as an afteri&ought as this is written) at least for a first\nmeeting. A Little impatiently* when 1 mentioned tbs need to get together with\nthe Board* eto** he asked why J didn't ge.&kacd and call such a meeting. That\nour drifting needs to cease* sfe'va been talking about this sort of thing for a\nlong tine. eto.
