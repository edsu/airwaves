  "text": "Harold Hill\n-2-\nFebmary 19, I960\nThe other day Lee Campion, the educational television consultant for\nDAVI, wrote me to find out about the utilization project* I had\nmentioned this project in a letter to Dr* Anna Hyer and she had\ntold Lee of this work. It seems that the DAVI Television Committee\nis interested in this problem of utilization also. Lee’s question\nwas whether or not we shouldn’t be working together. I wrote back\nto Lee and said I would check with you about the possibilities of a\njoint project. Lee suggested that we get together at their Cincinnati\nconvention to discuss the prospects* This would be find except I\nam not planning on attending the Cincinnati meeting. It runs in my\nmind that you have been working on a coordinated program with DAVI\nso you will very likely be there. If you are, would it be possible\nto meet with the Television Committee and find out what they have\non their mind? Off the record, I have mixed feelings about this\nproposal* I can see an advantage to working with DAVI but I also\nfeel that we do not need them for successful completion of the\nproject. Of course, it wouldn’t hurt to talk with them and if it\nis important enough1and you are not going to be at the convention\nthen I could use some of our money to go talk with them.\nUnless time is important, this could very likely be taken care of\nwhen I make my swing throughout the east. I had tentatively planned\non being in Washington anyway and would try and set up a meeting\nwith the DAVI people at that tine.\nRight now I’m waiting for a reply from Lee as to what the Television\nCommittee has in mind and what they will be doing at the Cincinnati\nconvention. When I hear from them I will get in touch with you.\nDirector of School Programs\nX and Research"
