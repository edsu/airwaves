  "text": "TO: NAEB BOARD\nRE: CONTINENTAL CLASSROOM,.INC*\nPROM: W.G. HARLEY\nDATE: June 30, 1959\nYou have all received copies of my letter to Arthur\nAdams and John Schwarzwalder*s reaction to it in which he\n^ka<t my statement of NAEB* s position was far too\nmild and that we should either decide to support Continental\nClassroom, Inc* as something worthwhile or. If we decided it\nwas a bad thing, use ©very means at our command to forthrightly\nopposing the new agency. He felt this was a matter of such\niraP°rtar^e that it merited an emergency meeting of\nshe NAEB Board.\nHe still feels this way about the matter but is willing\nto put the decision as to whether such a meeting be called to a\nmai_ ballot. His view Is that (1) obviously no other croup is\ndisposed to actively oppose Continental Classroom, Incl and,\nhence, (2) NAEB has the opportunity and Responsibility to seize\nc2nai leade^ship in organizing the opposition and leading the\nlight against a serious threat to ETV.\nI hfve Previously indicated my position in the letter\nto Adams and in the covering memo which accompanied it. On the\nbasis of reactions volunteered by Board members and the discussion\nClass:pooni^nc. by ETV station managers {Center\nAa.fxliates meeting, St* Louis, June 25-26), I do not feel such\na meeting is warranted. However, If five members of the Board\n(as provided in the Constitution) agree that such a meeting is\ndesirable, it will be called. Moreover, if there Is Indication\nor a substantial disagreement with my handline; of the matter or\nthat my letter did not accurately state NAFB*s position re Cont¬\ninental Classroom, Inc., I am ready to reassess the situation\nand take whatever action is deemed appropriate.\nW. G* Harley, Radio Hall, Madison 6, Wisconsin\n1.\nDo you favor calling a special meeting of the NAEB Board\nto discuss Continental Classroom, Inc.? YSS f~l H0|~j\n2. Comments:"
