  "text": "NAEB Region XI Radio Meeting Report\nPag® 2,\nHere, this report must necessarily become a bit vague* The session grm\nheated* Several people took strong stands on several different sides of\nthe question* Looking back, one thing is clear? most of the people\nwere unprepared fear such discussion* Most of them were reacting\nemotionally on the basis of inadequate information*\nWe had not allowed enough time for the discussion* Had the discussion\ntaken place in the morning, w© might have adjourned for lunch and come\nback to conversations which produced more understanding*\n|f There is very little point in detailing the arguments which took place,\nJ particularly in view of the fact that the NAEB Board met the following\nI week in Columbus and took definite action on the matter*\nThose of us who met in Atlanta on April 22 strongly urge that all\npersons involved in the NAEB-NETRC discussions present information as\nsoon as possible to the NAEB membership committee, particularly those\npeople most directly involved, the radio people* This must be done\nwell in advance of the Pall National NAEB Convention in order to avoid <—\non a arach greater seal® — our experience in Atlanta*\nIn closing, I want to thank the many people who attended the meting and\nthose who helped to make it at least one of the liveliest radio meetings\nin many a year* Particular thanks should go to Raymond Hurlburt,\nTelevision Director for Region H, who permitted the radio session to\nhitch-hike on the excellent organisation he had set up for the television\nmeeting*\nRF/as\n6A6/60"
