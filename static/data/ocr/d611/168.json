The year\nbetween the last American Management Association Conference on\nEducation and Training and this one.\n(No, Messrs. Trowbridge, Lenoue and Cogan, I am not endorsing\nthe AMA or last year's Conference as the progenitor of achievements\nin this field--though that Conference may indeed have contributed\ntoward the spark of thought and action. This measurement of time\nis more a personal one.)\nAt last year's Conference, as chairman of the general session\non \"The Revolution in Instructional and Educational Television,” I\nspoke on the needs of the inner-cities, specifically on \"Communi-\ncations and Crisis.” At that time virtually no one was talking\nabout the subject, and even less was being done.\nToday, however, one year later, we find a general session\nspecifically devoted to the subject of \"Education, Training and the\nUrban Crisis,” under the heading of \"The Three R's Today-Rights,\nRevolution and Remedy.” Although we all wish that such a topic might\nbe inapplicable to our society, it is gratifying to know that we are\nmaking some progress: we have gone beyond the limiting \"cool it”\napproach to \"revolution,” and are making efforts to understand the\n\"rights” in our title, and to do something about them, to actuate the \"remedy\"\nin our title. For example, I suggested last year that a primary task\nin the inner-city is, through communications, to \"make a dent in the\ncurtain of hopelessness that has been pulled down over every black\nchild and adult ... ghettoized into economic and cultural poverty.”"
