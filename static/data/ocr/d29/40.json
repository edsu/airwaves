We would seem to have no alternative but to\nface the subliminal levels of media* old and new, in order\nto maintain autonomy and relevance of response to new sit¬\nuations to-day.\nBut increased awareness of the forms of the media, as\nthey operate upon our modes of perception and judgement^ is\nnot merely a means of understanding, but of prediction and\ncontrol. Awareness of media is itself a change and a cause\nof change . In understanding media, some teachers will ex¬\nperience uncertainty and doubt and Insecurity. They will\nsense that areas of knowledge which they have acquired\nwith difficulty are being undermined, as it were, by their\nown new Insights into the structure and assumptions of that\nknowledge. They will find difficulty in talking about media,\nin which they themselves have a, deep personal and also a\nvested Interest, to adolescents who have not as yet any aware¬\nness of having a stake in such knowledge.\nThe mental discipline necessary for transposing the\nrealities of our lives Into new spheres, and new media, turns\nus all into mental B*Ps. to-day. But we are mental D.Ps."
