Izanagi dipped his jeweled spear in\nthe water, and as he lifted it, salt water dropped from\nthe point and solidified to form the first of the islands\nof Japan. Izanagi and Izanami descended to the new land,\nmarried, and began to people heaven and earth. By washing\nhis left eye, Izanagi produced the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu-\n0-mikami. She took over the rule of heaven and passed\nearth over to her grandson and his descendants, the Emperors\nof Japan. This is the beguiling Shintoist explanation of\norigins - right down to the present Emperor. Thus, Japan's\nprimitive folk religion of nature gods and divine ancestors\nis linked from its beginning with the Japanese throne.\nThe result was SHINTO - the way of the gods - and although\nofficially abolished after the war, it has seen a new birth.\nIn fact 30,000 of the original 110,000 shrines are back\nin operation.\nLet's turn to the land of Fujiyama itself. The first\nglimpse of Japan is apt to bo disappointing to the stranger--\nthe environs of Haneda airport or the Yokohama and Kobe\nDocks are less impressive than are most national entrance\ngateways. But once the traveller is ashore, and reaches\nthe Japan that lies beyond the initial drabness, a transformaÂ¬\ntion happens. The impact of Japan varies with the individual,\nbut surprisingly (OFTEN) Japan makes an impression such as\nis rarely created elsewhere upon experienced travellers\naway from their homelands.\n( 3 )"
