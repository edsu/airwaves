Look: we have the materials\nto prove that the penitentiary system reforms, and that it does not\nreform: that it is costly, and that it is cheap; that it is easy to adÂ¬\nminister, and that it is impracticable; in short, that it suits, and that it\ndoes not suit France, according to the taste of the selector.\nAnd wo guarantee to support each of these assertions with pertinent\nexamples.\nAll these doubts we must try to set forth clearly in our prison reports.\nBut there is something I have seen in Sing-Sing that I must know more\nabout; and something that we can only find out about outside the walls\nof the penitentiary.\nWhat is that?\nReligion: morality and religion. As soon as we return to New York\nCity, Beaumont, I propose to try and find out about religion in a\ndemocracy.\nFINALE; ESTABLISH: THEN BG FOR TOC.\nThe nations of our time cannot prevent the conditions of man from\nbecoming equal, but it depends upon themselves whether the principle\nof equality is to lead them to servitude, or freedom, to knowledge or\nbarbarism, to prosperity or wretchedness.\nFINALE UP AND TO END.\nMUSIC:"
