Depth of field is determined by the F stop of the light source lens*\n2. The locations of the various multiple banks of photo-cells\ncontribute pickup detail which corresponds to that of similarly\nlocated lighting units in conventional camera systems (L e.\none bank of photo-cells may pickup “backlight” while another\nunit picks up key light etc*).\n3. Elimination of shadows in the scene is carried out by carefully\nbalancing the location of photo-cell banks in a manner similar to\nthe placement of lighting units in present studio techniques*\n4. Panning, dollying, focussing and all other operations attendant\nto the mobile light source have the same effect on the picture\nas corresponding functions of a conventional camera.\nOf course the fact that such a system can be shown to work on a reciprocal\nbasis as compared with current methods 'r not alone a statement of superiority\nor even equivalence from an over-all standpoint* Rather, the advantages lie in\nthe apparent simplification of the apparatus required and the simplicity with which\ncolor pictures may be produced.\nIn the apparatus demonstrated each photo-cell pickup unit was equipped\nwith three photoelectric circuits for picking up the red, green and blue color\ncomponents corresponding to established color techniques* Individual outputs of\nthese banks were switched and controlled in a manner similar to the way conventional\nstudio lights are handled. Thereafter the resulting color balanced signals were\ntreated in the usual manner resulting in an encoded composite color video signal*\nThe mobile light source was mounted in a standard camera housing."
