In the same city, traffic vio¬\nlators receive cards advising them\nto watch an etv safe-driving series.\nThe audience for the in-school\naspects of etv consists of students,\nclassroom teachers, school officials,\nand the community. Even in ex¬\ntremely cost-conscious communi¬\nties, etv is seldom promoted as a\ntax-saving device. It is regarded\nas one of many educational re¬\nsources, along with school build¬\nings, teachers, and textbooks. After\na while, students begin to pay less\nattention to the medium as such\nand judge televised instruction\nmore on the basis of its quality.\nAnd to teachers and school and col¬\nlege administrators, etv is funda¬\nmentally a versatile tool, only as\nuseful as the imagination and abil¬\nity of the people behind it."
