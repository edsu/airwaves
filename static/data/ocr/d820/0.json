Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Cecil:\nThank you for the copy of your letter from Murray\nCrosby on the subject of FM multiplexing. As I in¬\nterpret the letter, we can expect little likelihood of\nFM multiplexing for the purpose we have in mind within\nthe immediate future. I am still of the opinion that\nthis general idea represents worthwhile potential op¬\nportunity for the NAEB, and for this reason would ap¬\npreciate your sending me any further information that\nshould come your way.\nPBRfmf"
