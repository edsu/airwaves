C.\nDear Mr. Bates\nTou probably will open this letter and the note I sent a few hours\nearlier about the same time, but I thought perhaps the intervening\ntime might be important to you.\nAs you know, the EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION AND RADTO PLACEMENT SERVICE\nis just starting at its new location here. Wte hope to be in full op¬\neration by May 1, 195k* However, we will send a notice to key contact\npersons in cities where applications for educational channels have\nbeen filed, if Mr. King is willing.\nAlso enclosed is a letter to Mr. King asking for more information about\nhis TV staff members. Of course we will do our best to place, them,\nbut it might be rather slow because we are just getting \"set up”, and\nunfortunately, as usual, the job inquiries outnumber the job opportunit¬\nies. Hfe hope to rectify this within the next two to three weeks\nhowever*\nThank you for forwarding your letter so promptly*\nVery truly yours.\nEDUCATIONAL TELEVISION AND RADIO PLACEMENT SERVICE\nDon Walker (in charge)\nqci Dr. Skomia\nEnel. 1"
