But, if it is what he has in mind,\nsomething might be put together using some of the observations I have\nexpressed above^: that would be a little easier to comprehend than what McLuhan\nhas said - or this may be worthy only of the trashcan.\nGeneral Reactions:\nMcLuhan, from the tone of his letter, seems to feel hurt and left out\nof other activities (non-NAEB). To me, tying with stag lines, series, of\nbeys, etc., is carrying linear concept to the ridiculous.\nSuggested Budget (per\nyear)\nMcLuhan\n$15,000\nSecretarial\n4,000\nResearch Assistant\n6,000\nSupplies & Equipment\n1,000\nTravel\n3,000\nPublication and\nDistribution\n5,000\nSub Total\n134,000\nIndirect (1550\n5,100\nTotal $39,100\nIt probably really would take two years rather than one. The only advantage\nto McLuhan being in Urbana is that we could perhaps keep him a little more\n\"down to earth\". The two years to start July 1, 1959 - McLuhan is probably\ncommitted for the rest of this academic year.\nHEH (12/13/58)"
