Only kidding.\nBe: JC®T memo.\nYour or someone has un&erlined/sentenee on page 3»\nI think the primary functions of JuE T should not be changed.\nWhat I believe the sentence should say (and may have actually\nmeant to say) is that JCET*s major efforts at this time should\nbe in this direction. In any event, I etc not believe primary\nfunction or functions of JCET should be changed, if a major\neffort is to be made in direction Indicated by memo, this is\nan ffort that still falls under primary purpose.\nOver-all, I see this danger, or raise the question\nof danger. If such action or actions are taken by JCET, would\nthis not throw open the door for wide-open modification of the\nSixth Report and Order? This seems to me a dangerous thing.\nTills seems to open door for other parties to join in at the\ntime of JCET requested hearing and give the commercial boys\n(those same boys who were caught sleep at the switch on\norlglanl JCET efforts, hearings and subsequent FCC actions on\nETV reservations). I doubt if this is worth the risk.\nI am aware that Sixth Report and Order Is being\ndissemated by Individual actions. An open invitation to toss\nit out Is dangerous, seems to me.\nOn other hand, I think JCET might proceed with the\npurpose, and not open wide the doors. For example, seek first\nand. foremost to help in Detroit and Rochester areas. I agree\nthat ETV is needed In more and larger metropolitan areas.\nIn other words, I think it is a matter of procedure\nand tactics. The goal of ETV for NYC, for example, is good for\nJCET and others to have. What have the NY Interest done? Not\nfought for ETV what chances were best. So we have the WOR\nepisode. Maybe It could not have been otherwise.\nDon't know that I've been helpful, but these are my\ncomments at this hour.\nRegards"
