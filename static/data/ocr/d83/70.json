You see, our budget for this project is pretty well\nexhausted and we’re not quite sure, and won’t be for several months,\nexactly how much we will have left after paying expenses already incurred.\nAs I’m sure you appreciate, the HAEB cannot afford to pay any of the\nexpense of this project from its regular operational budget which is firmly\ncacsBitted. However, if it appears that there will be some funds left, I\nbelieve that we would be justified in meeting some of the expenses you\nindicated in your letter.\nTherefore, with your permission, I will wait until we are in a better\nposition to determine our final fiscal balance before trying to determine\nhow much, if indeed anything at all, we can pay to you. I realize that\nthis is an indefinite answer, and I appreciate the work you have done for\nthe project in spite of the apparent problems, but this is the only solution\nI can offer at this time.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President"
