With the protective mantle of\n'•democracy11 they have been free to accept new ideas or to reject\nthem, often with no more reason than that dictated by personal whim.\nI want to be certain that 1 am net classed with the \"finger shakers\"\nwho want to blame our school leaders for the ills of our society.\nTheir assignment is tremendous. I ask only that there be some\nevidence of unbiased thinking on the solutions for our national problems •\nHow can educators approach industry for help when there is so little\nevidence of the joint meeting of their own minds ?\ni 1 hope that you will pardon my use of the NAJEB as a sounding board.\n| I get a little weary of platitudes and loose talk and again 1 bare taken\nadvantage of your invitation to be blunt.\n, Sincerely yours,\nMOTOROLA INC.\nPhilip A.
