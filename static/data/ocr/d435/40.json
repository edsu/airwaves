Novik\nAmbassador Hotel\nLos Angeles, California\nDear Morrist\nInasmuch as you request off-the-record guidance in regard to\nhow active you should be on behalf of the ETRC in attempting to secure\na special status with AFTRA and the other unions, offhand I would guess\nthat you should provide all advice possible to the ETRC. Anything you\ncan do informally to achieve recognition of the fact that the funds\navailable to the ETRC are only a drop in the bucket as compared to the\nneed, would also seem justified.\nPersonally, and subject to Graydon*s feeling as well, I do\nnot think that you should represent the ETRC formally or be expected to\nhave the full information on their operation that efforts to \"represent*\nthem would imply.\nAs X look back over this, I have a feeling that this is\npretty much the way you seem to see the situation. In a way ETRC\nrepresents \"national1* as opposed to the NAEB \"local\" on the labor\nscene as well, however. And ae such, the two are obviously not entirely\nseparable* Does this do it?\nBest regards*\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSivc\ncc flows"
