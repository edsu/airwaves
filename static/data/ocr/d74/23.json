We have heard plenty from England,\nand a fair amount from France, We know practically nothing about\nthe developments in other countries. Since the seminar is insisting\non persons with a good knowledge of English, this should be no\nproblem. Why not devote one session to hearing from a few of these\npeople? Some of the NAEB'ers will hear them at Purdue but not the\nmajority. In addition, the Purdue meeting will not cover radio at\nall. We could discover any interesting developments in educational\nradio in some of these countries,\n2, Wilbur Schramm could do a paper pulling together that series of six\nor so studies on TV which the Department of Education has commissioned\nunder his general direction, 1 gather that the study Bronson is doing\nis one of these.\n3, Paul Lazarsfeld is always good for a talk on the kinds of research\nneeded in an area — television and children, educational broad¬\ncasting, or whatever.\n4, William McPhee at the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia"
