So here are the\na list of the contents of each issue\nBE TO MAKE CARBONS OF THE LETTERS\nCARBONS FOR THE MARCH-APRIL ISSUE.\nBefore we decided to do it this way, we had already written to Robert L.\nShayon and Loren Stone. Shayon^s article is his keynote address before the\nlast NAEB convention. Stone!s is about CATV’s role in £TV.\nThe only one t think might be valuable to have reprints of is Colby’s\non \"Pictorial Paragraphing” ...and of course the \"Production Forum\" column\nas usual.\nThe CATV people have already ordered 5,000 reprints of Stone’s) so if\nIT SEEMS AT ALL WORTHWHILE, WE COULD GET A FEW MORE AT VERY LITTLE COST.\nBest,\nHaro ld\nHope your return trip was pleasant"
