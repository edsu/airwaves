Ad there\nmay be af ew broadcasts in the offing, too.\nAll this doesn't leave much time for entertainment, but we har e got ten in\naf things. Frances and I have gone three times to symphony cuonc erts\nin Festival Hall. The orchestrasw ere pretty good, the conductors mostly\nonly fair, the hall’s acoustics poor (too dead), and the audieic es large\nand enthusiastic. I guess we operate in the German and French rather than\n•British orchestral traditions.

Last Sunday, for\nexample, we had tea with Sir Arthur and \"lady Bliss. (He is one of Englands\nbest contemporary composers, and was BBC \"music director for two years in\nthe war). The week before we went out to visit two people who entertained\nme in the Lake Country in Selp ember 1945.
