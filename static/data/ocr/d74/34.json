  "text": "By the way, I enjoyed your piece in the recent issue of\nStudies in Public Communication, I would only take issue with\nthe somewhat loose use of statistics here and there. Specifically,\nthe t-tests for levels of intelligence in Tables 3 and 5 are not\njustifiable because of the lack of a significant interaction\n(shown in Tables 4 and 6)• Since you found no significant inter¬\naction, you are only justified in doing a t-test on main-effects\nof television (that is, collapsing across intelligence groups)\nwhich in this case is unnecessary since there was only TV or no-TV\nand so the direction of difference is known. With the number of\ncases that you had, you have a fairly precise test of interaction\nwith your analysis of variance. Ignoring these results and testing,\nin effect for interaction again, with your series of t-tests is quite\nhard to justify. I can see why you wanted to do it, in the light\nof a significant interaction in Table 2. However, it misleads the\nreader on the level of proof which you have for your conclusion\nabout the effect of intelligence level. It seems to me that your\nresults from the t-tests in Table 1 and just visual examination\nof Tables 3 and 5 is suggestive that television may be more helpful\nto bright and dull children than to average children. I don't be¬\nlieve that you can say more than that however."
