Harley\nPresident\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nDuPont Circle Office Building\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Mr. Harley:\nI received the communique from NAEB headquarters which proposes\nthat NAEB experiment in the contracting for package television\nproductions. I recall that at the last NAEB convention, a few\ntelevision members discussed this point on an informal basis.\nI, at that time, was opposed to the idea, and I still am opposed\nto it.\nHowever,' if this experimental production is vital to NAEB, I am\nof the opinion that the television member stations should be\ncontacted as to the desirability of such an action because the\nprogram needs of a non-commercial station can, in all proba¬\nbility, be best reflected by the persons who are on the local\nscene.*' To my recall, I did not have a chance to voice an opinion\nother than informally.\nThis letter is not to be construed that I am unhappy with NAEB.\nI believe that you, as President, and the other members of your\norganization, have provided the non-commercial educational broad¬\ncaster with an administrative service for which I am thankful.\nBest wishes.\nJUN 11 |962\nA M\nKNME-TV\n?l ?l 112| 3| 4| 6|jS\nDick Hull, Chairman of full\nRay Hurlburt, Chairman TV Board, NAEB/\nFCHicwh\ncc:"
