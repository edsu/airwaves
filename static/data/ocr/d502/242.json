Emery*\nLegal and Educational Consultant, Joint Committee on Educational Television\nIT has now been about a year and\na half since the Federal Communica¬\ntions Commission reserved 242 tele¬\nvisions channels for education. Since\nthat time more than 40 states have\nheld conferences to consider the\nproblems of building and operating\nstations on these channels.\nForty-seven applications for con¬\nstruction permits have been filed\nwith the FCC and 21 have been\ngranted. The University of Houston\nis already on the air with regular\nprograms; the Allan Hancock Foun¬\ndation of Los Angeles is testing\nequipment and expects to be in regu¬\nlar operation soon. A considerable\nnumber of other communities such\nas San Francisco, Denver, Oklahoma\nCity, St. Louis, Chicago, Pittsburgh,\nChapel Hill, North Carolina and\nBoston already have authorizations\nfrom the FCC and will have educa¬\ntional television stations in opera¬\ntion within a short time. If the pre¬\nsent trend of interest continues there\nmay be as many as fifty educational\nstations in operation by 1955.\nOne of the most critical problems\nconfronting those who are making\nplans for educational stations is to\nfind qualified managers and direc¬\ntors. Developments in this field have\nbeen so rapid that there has been\ncomparatively little time to train\nmanagerial personnel.\nSome progress is being made. Ac¬\ncording to the 1953-54 Directory of\nCollege Courses in Radio and Tele¬\nvision more than one hundred edu¬\ncational institutions are now offer¬\ning courses in television. Last year\nabout fifty institutions conducted\ntelevision workshops and according\nto a recent inquiry of the American\nCouncil on Education, 194 of its in¬\nstitutional members had presented\none or more television programs\nover local stations.\nOne of the first and most impor¬\ntant workshops following the lifting\nof the television freeze was the one\nheld at Iowa State College August\nlast year. More than 50 outstanding\npersons in the field of educational\nbroadcasting participated. The faci¬\nlities of WOI-TV at the College\nwere used, and the problems of\nfinancing, constructing, managing\nand programming an educational\ntelevision station were considered.\nThis was followed by similar work¬\nshops in other institutions and com¬\nmunities. During the past summer\nseveral successful workshops and\nconferences dealing with the prob¬\nlems of managment and production\nwere conducted by Syracuse Uni¬\nversity, University of Pittsburgh,\nPhiladelphia public schools, Michi¬\ngan State College, University of Mi¬\nchigan, University of Illinois and\nIowa State College and Denver pub¬\nlic schools.\nDuring the past year it has been\nmy good fortune to participate in a\nnumber of these workshops and to\ntalk with a large number of respon¬\nsible persons who have had or will\nhave the task of selecting managers\nfor educational television stations.\nWhile there are of course some dif¬\nferences of opinion, there seems to\nbe fairly general agreement on the\nfollowing basic qualifications for\nsuch jobs.\n1. The manager of an educational\ntelevision station obviously ought to\nbe an educated person — Such a\nstation in a real sense is a communi¬\nty school dedicated to the enlighten¬\nment of all the people. A balanced\nprogram structure should therefore\ninclude a wide variety of informa-\n*Dr. Emery (LL.B., Oklahoma, 1934; Ph.D., Wisconsin, 1939) concluded nine years of\nservice with the Federal Communications Commission before he resigned in 1952 to become\nlegal and educational consultant to the Joint Committee on Educational Television. As an\neducator he served as director of Station WNAD, University of Oklahoma, 1932-35; has ap¬\npeared on many educational radio and television programs in different parts of the country;\nand has served appointments at the University of Oklahoma, the University of Wisconsin,\nand the Ohio State University. As an attorney he is licensed to practice before the Federal\nCommunications Commission, the District of Columbia Courts, and the United States Supreme\nCourt."
