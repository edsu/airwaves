Skomia\nlli Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry*\nThank you for your September 9 letter copy from Haskell Boyter\nof the Board of Education of the City of Atlanta in which he\ngracefully and understandably concludes affiliation with the\nKAEB Tape Network.\nWhile I understand the difficulties which prompted this necessary\ndecision on his part, I cannot help but feel a sense of desolation\nwhich this letter makes all too clear. In some instances radio\nand television, as educational instruments, still suffer under the\ndefinition of being appendages instead of major instruments in the\neducational process.\nTo the degree that this concept remains unaltered and part of the\nfailure to alter it rests on the shoulders of everyone of us. Thus\nwill the dream continue to be a small dream instead of the vital\nforce it could be.\nSincerely,\nRichard B* Hull\nRadio-TV Director\nRBHidm\ncc: Graydon Ausmus"
