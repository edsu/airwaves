W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nYour memo of May 25 (re: experimental TV production) bobs up\nwhenever I disturb the stack of \"things I ought to do something\nabout, but probably won’t.\" I will take a belated shot at it.\nIn recent years NAEB has adapted well to a rapidly changing\nenvironment and has been alert to new aspects of educational\nbroadcasting and to attendant new problems. (/It was appropriate\nto declare us a professionally oriented organization but it was\nnot particularly necessary, because we already had become that.\nThis production proposal does not seem consistent with the role\nNAEB has so carefully defined for itself.*'\n‘There can be only one long range purpose of the proposed project\nand that is head-on competition with NETRC for production money\nand for affiliations;' regardless of the disclaimer, \"This does\nnot contemplate the setting up of any regular system of distribu¬\ntion and production.\" There could be a short range needling thing\ngoing but this is too young a business for that kind.of boat rocking\nto be tolerated, and I can not think for a moment that you regard\nthis proposal as a needle.\nThe national program service has some deficiencies, but for my part\nI only wish that any other segment of our operation had so few bugs.\nNAEB might go out in a new suit and snag a grant for a spectacular\nseries. You would, however, be trading on what the stations and NETRC\nhave established; and you would certainly be confusing prospective grantors\nfor Center production.#l\nI'm ag’in it.\nSincerely,\nAUG 6\nRB/jc"
