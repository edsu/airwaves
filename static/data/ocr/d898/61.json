C. 20036\nDear Mr. Swezey:\nAttached is the listing of educational radio stations\nfor possible statistical review by ARB. I have listed\nthe stations according to the fifty major TV markets,\nwhich I am assuming also include radio. There is a\nfairly even national distribution/\nThose stations which have asterisks before the city I\nconsider to be the most representative educational radio\nstations. Also included with these are the nine addit¬\nional stations of interest noted at the end of the\nlisting. These stations are not included in the top\nfifty markets.\nThe second attachment includes those stations with\nadequate production facilities and staff to produce a\nprogram, series or project for the Experiments with\nSound CPB grant.\nI spoke briefly with Herman Land this afternoon. In\nthe morning I will be calling a number of NER station\nmanagers urging them to send proposals for the Experi¬\nmental Sounds grant to the Corporation and Herman Land.\nAt the same time, I will urge them to contact others in\ntheir area to do the same. Hopefully, we may begin to\nfeel the fruits of our efforts by sometime early next\nweek. We will continue to encourage our member stations\nthrough our upcoming Memo to Managers to submit proposals\nas rapidly as possible in order that these efforts will\nhave some impact on the upcoming legislative hearings.\nWe will continue to keep you and Herman Land informed\nas we make our contacts. If there is anything else we\ncan do at this time, please let us know and we will\ncontribute in whatever way we can.\nSincerely,\nLucinda K. Landreth\nAdministrative Assistant"
