This would last for at least a week and\nwould examine particularly a new method recently worked out in the\nARD whereby a mono signal could be converted to stereo. Dr. Lauterbach\nundertook that his organization would send the report and any relevant\nsound documents emanating from this meeting to other EBU members on\nrequest. Mr. Trutat added that the ORTF, too, was organizing some¬\nthing very similar during the 48 hours immediately following the Paris\n’’Festival International du Son”. It was likely that from this source\nas well sound documents would be available and he expressed the hope\nthat such documents would be distributed between member organizations\nto avoid the costs of each having to produce his own.\nThe experts agreed to recommend to the Radio Programme\nCommittee :\nthat EBU member organizations look favourably upon\nand do what they can to facilitate the attachment to\nthem for -periods of time and for purposes which would\nvary and depend in each case of appropriate members of\nthe staffs of other organizations as may seek such\nattachments (drama producers, technicians, etc);\n~ that the Radio Programme Section of the Administrative\nOffice should seek from and distribute to all member\norganizations information on what they can offer by way\nof sound documents designed for staff training purposes,\ntraining courses themselves and seminars for staff\ninvolved in radio drama production and the terms and\nconditions (length, costs, etc) of these as well as of\nindividual attachments of staff members.\nthat organizations who employ freelance writers or\nproducers should be encouraged to give them grants or\nsome other form of financial assistance to enable them,\ntoo, to benefit from attachment to other organizations."
