Between the two, if the\nprice of Independence of NAEB Is not involved, I‘d be inclined\nto favor East Lansing. If it should bring more involvements\ninstead of fewer, then I'd be opposed to East Lansing.\nOn Ann Arbor, the thing in favor of that site would b© the\nproximity to the Center. This assumes the Center is to stay\nin Ann Arbor. I'm not so sure that is going to happen. But\nif it does, then nearness of the two to each other is good.\nPersonally, I don't like Ann Arbor for geographical\nlocation. Too darned difficult to get to and from, especially\nthe airport. Also, I thought Center made a mistake In not\npicking Champaign-Urbana, or Chicago, but I'm not upset about\nit. If the Center wishes to be in AA, or some other spot,\nit's o.k. by me. It's interesting to note that the Center\nends up by using Uof I for distribution. Logic seems to be\nwith me, anyhow.\nOne other thing, God willing I'll have all the treasurer's\nreports ready, audited, reported, duplicated for convention\ntime. Don't want you to worry about that.\nAlways good to see you, and especially have you in our\nhome. The family always enjoys your presence.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooiey"
