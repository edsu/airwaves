I hope I have\nnot emasculated it too much. Each step, I think, brings us closer\nto something that looks like a workable project. (And if we don’t\nget fimds from the U.S. Government we’ll try some place else!.)\nPlease rear up on your hind legs if I’ve ruined it. I figured that if\nI put it in terms that even |.ean understand, probably the committee\nwill, too. And I want them to get excited about it, as the most\nbasic and original proposal they will have received.\nYou’ll note that there’s still a big lk>r you to do. I’m 'Haling up”,\n\"ferreting out” etc. all I can, but I have all too little time for this\n(which is really not my \"backyard\"), between things that have to be\ndone \"yesterday.”\nI’m not sensitive. So please redo my version all you want. Then I\nthink we're about ready to send it in.\nBest for the New Year. And thanks for your comments (and especially\nMrs. M’s) on my \"map” and article. We’re trying to keep both\nhonest if not handsome!\nSincerely,\nHJS:jg\nEnclosures (2)\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
