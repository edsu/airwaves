  "text": "The analysis of weekly monitoring point data over a one year period\nprior to submission of data is one approach. It is suggested, however, that\nconsiderable leeway as to this proposal be allowed and that the sufficiency\nof data be evaluated on the basis of engineering judgement. In any event, in\nsome cases, the variabilities of the propagation medium will have to be sorted\nout from the array stability factors. In some existing cases, where data of\nmore than a years prior duration is already available, this should be most\nhelpful in making the engineering evaluation required.\nSection 9(2)\n’’Daily base current ratios, loop current ratios,\nphase relations and common point current readings\nfor a period of 30 days, commencing not more than\nW days prior to the submission of the data. The\ndata should be accompanied by information respecting\nadjustments of phasing and other tuning of the\ntransmitterrand associated equipment lt~was found\nnecessary to perform in this period.*'\nThese requirements represent an adequate amount of data of this\nsort in the opinion of affiant. In cases where a phase monitor is not\nrequired by the station license, loop current data obtained by alternate\nmeans would suffice. In cases where no loop current measuring system exists\nthe installation of such a system should be required within a reasonable period.\nIf this portion of the data is taken by use of a phase monitor then phase\nrelation records would be required.\nSection 9(3)a\n”A complete proof of performance on the directional\nantenna system if no such proof has been submitted\nto the Commission within five years from the date\nof application for remote control operatlonT*\nAffiant is in agreement with this provision assuming developments\nsince the last filed proof of performance cait no doubt upon its validity.\n- 6 -"
