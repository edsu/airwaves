Theresa Avenue\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nDear Marguerite:\nGradually picking up the odds and ends.\nI have here a talk by Robert Herridge (Camera Three) on his philosophy\nof television production. If I remember correctly, you had this re¬\ncorded because, it is of interest to all broadcasters. The talk,\n^incidentally, is \"raw” — not programmed. t'~->\nHow is this to be handled? A school committee offering for \"in-\nstation” listening? All stations? Or programmed for broadcast?\nHas it been released for broadcast? As soon as we know, we’ll get\nit out accordingly.\nSincerely, ^\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager ^\nJH*iv * D ~ *tf—\n^\n4 SU1.-* y. -\nJLa.a~>"
