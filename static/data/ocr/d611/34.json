The NAEB commends the Commission for its forthright\npolicy statement concerning non-discrimination in broadcast employ¬\nment and programming practices. The NAEB agrees with the Commission\nthat serious public interest questions are raised when a substantial\ncharge is made that a broadcast licensee is deliberately discrimina¬\ntory in its employment or programming policies and practices. Section\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 establishes a national policy\nagainst discrimination because of \"race, color, religion, sex or\nnational origin” by employers in any industry affecting interstate\ncommerce who employ at least 25 persons, with respect to hiring, dis¬\ncharging or training of employees, and with respect to fixing their\nterms and conditions of employment. Likewise, Executive Order 11246\n1/ The NAEB is an organization of educational institutions and indi¬\nviduals concerned with the development of educational radio and\ntelevision. On behalf of its membership, the NAEB has regularly\nparticipated in rule-making proceedings before the Commission con¬\ncerning matters of interest to educational broadcasters and reser¬\nvations for non-commercial educational use. The NAEB has long\nsupported the Commission’s policy to reserve a fair share of the\navailable frequency space for non-commercial educational radio and\ntelevision use."
