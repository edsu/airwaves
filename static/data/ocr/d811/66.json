Skornia, Executive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n14 Gregory Hal 1\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nEnjoyed our telephone conversation the other day in re the new\nKellogg grant and wish again to express my pleasure at the\nhappy outcome of our negotiations and my particular appreciation\nof the vital and indispensable role you personally played in\narriving at this outcome.\nThank you for the recent enclosures of the February 2nd letter\nfrom Maurice Seay and your January 31 and February 3rd letter to\nhim. Agree that the returned proposal should be re-done and\ntried on other foundations. Don‘t nourish any pangs about the\n\"double pitch.\" l*m sure Maurice won*t.\nUnder the very good terms of the new grant it would seem to me\nwe have the opportunity (and the necessity) to do some creative\nplanning for the future. I hope NAEB has a chance to discuss\nthis in depth sometime, before too long.\nAgain, best to you and thanks for the information.\nRBH/mh\nRichard B.
