Skomia\nDATE: April 18, 1958\nMr. Jacobson has $500.00 for us, as our first “industrial associate\" as\nI think we might well call them. With this first one I trust and hope we\ncan get more. As discussed with Schooley, we might well establish\n“Sustaining Members\" at $100.00 per year (can be individuals), and\n“Industrial Associates\" at $500.80 - $1,000.00. With this as a lever,\nwe might get a considerable number.\nHis suggestion was that we might get more such funds and contributors\nif we set it up as a “John Weiss Fund*8 or something. The attached is\nmy reply after thinking it over a few minutes. I need your reaction,\nthough — specifically on the “Weiss Fund\" part.\nI assume you8li all go along with his making a *'surprise88 presentation\nto Burton at the luncheon on May 121\nI imagine it would be better if the element of surprise were preserved;\nno?\nRegards,\nHyJ.
