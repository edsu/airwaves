Don’t\nquote mel). Our position under this point of view is rather that we are\nhappy to have other educational broadcasters in our midst and we want\nto help than to achieve the happy state which is ours, that of operating\nand owning stations.\nNow all of this doubtless seems very primary grade to you\nbut I didn’t understand it until it was explained to me at the con¬\nvention. This is the sort of philosophy which it seems to me needs\nto be conveyed to newcomers. And it seems to me that one of the best\nways to convey it is to set it forth in the constitution.\nSo I would like to urge that special attention be given to\nsection D of the attached report.\nPlease accept my apologies for the length of this letter (I\nhave already apologized to my secretary) and ray cordial good wishes for\na rich and rewarding experience in your new office.\nSincerely,\nREB/g\nend.\nR. Edwin Browne,\nDirector of Radio\nand Television"
