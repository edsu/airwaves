As you\nknow, there has been expressed a feeling that we should do more\nprestige pi^gromaira; for the good of NAkB and the general good\nof educational broadcasting.\nAlso, there may be some areas in which our network programming\nsuffers because of our failure to provide series. Therefore,\ntii© Board will consider seriously recommendations for the pur¬\npose of producing prestige programs♦ Considerable money has\nalready been spent on the dc Tocqueville scripts. This is one\nreason why I wanted your committee to consider them along with\nany other ideas. Xou may recall that we have the possibility\nof getting some thing like ':i5*000 for one or more series of\nrood radio programs. It is anticipated that these would be\nprofessionally produced nd not necessarily produced by any\nNAEB member.\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Pick Vogl because ho raises\na question in a letter which I also received, in this morning1©\nmall. Likewise, I shall enclose a carbon of my reply to him so\nyou will hive the complete story.\nBest wishes.\nSincerely yours,\nFEB:cJf\ncot Hr* Vogl\nEnclosure\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident"
