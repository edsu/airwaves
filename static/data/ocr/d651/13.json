Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nThis is in delayed response to your memorandum of May 25,\nregarding '’Experimental Television Production.” I’m in favor\nof grants in general and am delighted particularly when they\nare designed to support worthwhile educational programs. We\nat Missouri would be interested in knowing more about the\ndomestic project, but would have difficulty doing anything\nwith the foreign film project. While our facilities are\nheavily committed next year to completing eleven regular\nuniversity courses on video tape under a partial grant from\nFord, we would like to be kept informed as to your further\npIans.\nBest regards.\nCordially\nBarton L. Griffith, Director\nInstructional Television\nBLG:jh"
