Faxon Company, Inc.\n83 Francis Street\nBoston 15, Massachusetts\nI am returning to you the subscription order for NAEB TV Research\nFact Sheets from the Serials Department Library, University of\nNorth Carolina and from the State College of Washington, Pullman ,\nWasington. As you will note by the enclosed mimeographed letter,\nthe Fact Sheets are now incorporated in the NAEB Journal, and I\nbelieve these two schools already subscribe to that publication *\nThe Serieals Department at North Carolina is paid up till March,\n1958. Perhaps they would like to put through a renewal at this\ntime to insure the continued delivery of the Journal. The State College\nof Washington - Library is paid through July of 1959 * I assume this\nDepartment is the same as the department that subscribed to the Fact\nSheets.\nIf there are any questions regarding this subscription (s), please let\nme know.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gans\nSecretary\nEnclosures (returning subscription blanks)\nFact Sheet letter\nIndividual Membership Blanks"
