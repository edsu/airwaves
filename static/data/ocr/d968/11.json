Burrows, manager\nof University radio stations\nWUOM, Ann Arbor, and WVGR,\nGrand Rapids, and chairman of\nthe National Association of Edu¬\ncational Broadcasters board, to¬\nday issued a statement on Pres¬\nident Johnson’s recommenda¬\ntion yesterday that Congress\ncreate a Corporation for Public\nTelevision.\nThe proposed corporation\nwould use both public and pri¬\nvate funds to support noncom¬\nmercial broadcasting via televi¬\nsion and radio. Burrows called\nit a “breakthrough in federal\nattitudes” toward radio and\ntelevision, and noted it was the\nfirst time that radio had been\nincluded with TV.\nThe U-M radio station direc¬\ntor’s statement reads as fol¬\nlows:\n“I am sure I speak for all in¬\nstitutions and individuals in¬\nvolved in educational broadcast¬\ning in the United States when I\nsay how delighted we are with\nthe President’s message relat-\ni ing to the proposed legislation\non behalf of educational radio\n! and television.\n“The President’s compretet*-\nsion and wise consideration of\nthe needs of educational broad¬\ncasting as they relate to satel¬\nlite development, opportunities\nfor nationwide networking and\nfacilities are to be commended.\nEducational broadcasting’s con¬\ntribution to the enlightenment,\ninstruction, and cultural enrich¬\nment of the American people\nshould be immeasurably en¬\nhanced by the proposed legisla¬\ntion.\n“The creation of a Corpora¬\ntion for Public Broadcasting, in\nrecognition of the dual role in\neducation of both radio and tele¬\nvision, would give added weight\nand substance to the President’s\nrecommendations, and we are\nconfident that Congress will\ngive thoughtful consideration to\nthe past achievements and the\npotential for growth in all facets\nof educational broadcasting.”"
