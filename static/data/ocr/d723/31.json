Music Education\nSchool of Music\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Mr. Matterns\nThe NAEB Publication Order Blank which you filled out at the recent\nMEMO Conference in St. Louis, requesting samples of our publications\nhas been forwarded to us.\nUnfortunately as a membership-based organization, depending largely upon\nmembership fees and assessments for our financial support, we find that\nwe must make a charge for all publications and materials supplied to non-\nmembers . However I am attaching one sample publication for your perusal,\nand a list of the materials we have available. If you should care to order\nany of the items listed, please fill out the order blank and sedd it to¬\ngether with a check for the proper amount, and your order will be given\nprompt attention. I should point out, since there is sometimes a request\nfor our LP albums on a rental basis, that these albums are available only\non a sale basis. However the Department of Audio-Visual Aids, University\nof Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, does make these albums available on a ren¬\ntal basis, and I would suggest that you contact them if you are interested\nin such an arrangement.\nYou also requested information regarding membership in the NAEB, and I am\nhappy to give you this information.\nThe NAEB has three categories of membership, as follows:\nActive - Educational institutions, public service organizations,\netc. owning and operating their own radio and/or tele¬\nvision stations.\nAssociate - Institutions (as above) not owning stations, but oper¬\nating production centers and regularly producing pro¬\ngrams over a commercial outlet.\nAffiliate - Any organization or individual interested in the general\nfurtherance of educational broadcasting."
