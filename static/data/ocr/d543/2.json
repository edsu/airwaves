The wording of the attached resolution is\nthat contained in the official form provided by the bank which Keith will sign, as\nSecretary\nSince the technical transfer of funds takes place January 1 (although, of course\nit will take a couple of weeks to transfer the books, etc*), mad we will need to*\nwrite salary checks January 2, we would appreciate your prompt attention to this\nmatter*"
