No wonder the item “Netherlands News Journal” — a\ndaily survey of events great and small in the life of the Old Country\n— enjoys such popularity among this category of listeners.\nHowever, the value of the transmissions does not lie only in the\nsphere of human feeling. Keeping in touch with the Netherlands\nhas also a useful economic effect. In this way the immigrants act,\nas it were, as economic outposts. What they hear via Radio Neder¬\nland about new Dutch products is passed on by them, so\nthat here again the transmissions contain a strong export-stimu¬\nlating element. This kind of information is broadcast in news\nitems, reportages and other programmes.\nBesides the transmissions in the Dutch language, Radio Neder¬\nland, as has already been said, also broadcasts in English, Spanish,\nArabic, Indonesian and Afrikaans.

But their effectiveness is often reflected\nin the listener’s mail. Requests from foreigners to be put into\ncontact with Dutch manufacturers, inquiries about Dutch agri¬\ncultural and cattle-breeding methods, and about the touristic\npossibilities in this country, these are but a few examples of the\n10"
