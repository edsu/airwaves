  "text": "this lack of opportunity for rehearsal ms indicated as a real\nhandicap,-\nWhere video recording equipment was used to :skineR programs\nin school studio for fu&ure broadcasting $30,CO to $45-00 per hour was\nbudgeted as equipment coot* It was suggested that such sums could\ncover entire broadcasting costs where the school operated its own\nstation* The only other costs per program not already listed,\nwas an average indication of $10<>00 per program for publicity. This\nmay or may not be a legitimate program cost*\nXbe above results are submitted to you merely as an\nindication of the experiences of others in various parts of the country.\nIt might be interesting to note that the survey* while obviously spotty*\nnevertheless covered conditions well dispersed in the various parts\nof the country from the East Coast to the West Coast*\nIt seemed to your Committee that the most authentic and\npractical conclusion to be drawn from a close analysts of this\nsurvey is that there really is no such thing as a typical cost of a\ntypical, program^ that costa will invariably differ from program\nto program, from situation to situation* and will vary in relationship\nto the effectiveness and ingenuity of the staff as well as in\nrelationship to the amount of local resources available and donated.\nAll programming seems to be still in the experimental stage and certainly\nour reporting on costs is in the experimental stage , If any member has\nany question concerning the present report, or any suggestion for future\ninformation needed or desired, the Committee on television operations\nwill be very happy to have them and will endeavor to answer your\nquestions or act upon your suggestions just as scon as possible-"
