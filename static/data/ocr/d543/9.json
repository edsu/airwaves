The\nBoard said no*\nThis does not mean, however, that the ad hoc\ncommittee Jack and I appointed should not go ri^ht ahead _\nas they are — fully and dispassionately examining the\nwhole problem of the Center* s role in radio and it's relation\nto the NAFB Network*\nWise decisions cannot be made in an hour of\ndiscussion and in an emotional environment; this matter\nneeds careful consideration and extended study to bring\nin a suggested solution, alternatives and predictable\nconsequences of the changes or status quo*\nI reminded him, moreover, that we will soon have\na new board, with fresh opinions, and m increase in the\nTV personnel. Such a board, reviewing a carefully pre¬\npared study in May, might take a different attitude —\nthough not necessarily."
