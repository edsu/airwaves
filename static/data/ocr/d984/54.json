Street\nPortland 11, Oregon\nDear Mrs. Mickler:\nManor thanks for your letter and enclosure of March 15.\napologies for not answering you sooner, but I was out of the\noffice sick for a few days.\nFrankly, I m very impressed by the nature of the membership\ncampaign you have instituted within your region. I’m just sorry\nthat all of our regional directors haven*t as yet been able to see\ntheir way clear to go into this business of membership solicitation\nas thoroughly as you are. Perhaps that will come in time.\nI*m sorry we made those errors in the mailing lists you received,\nbut I am grateful for the fact that you spotted them and made the\nappropriate corrections.\nPlease don’t be concerned about the seasonal aspect of member¬\nship in AEHT. We find that usually a simple explanation to the\neffect that a membership remains in force for twelve calendar\nmonths, regardless of the time of the year it was taken out ...\nusually that sort of explanation will do the trick. Tou’11 be\ninterested to know, for example, that a tremendous number of\nrenewals have been made in past years at the Spring convention.\nThere are a msnber of sources of new members ... people who\nheretofore were not approached ... that 1*11 be discussing in the\nMarch issue of our Membership Newsletter. I think you’ll agree\nthat a lot of these folks operate on budgets that go right through\nthe summer months and, therefore, can be approached most anytime.\nProfessor Martin joins me in congratulating you on the scope\nof the AS ST Workshop Program which you had scheduled for March 2k •\nI’d appreciate it if you’d write out a summary of the day’s activi¬\nties and send it to me so that I may have it available for the\nme-ting in Columbus. I’m sure a number of the members will be\ninterested in it."
