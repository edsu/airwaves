Broderick\nRadio-TV Education Specialist\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare\nOffice of Education\nWashington 25, D.C.\nDear Mrs. Broderick:\nProfessor Martin passed along to me your letter of February 23\nregarding AERT materials to be displayed at the forthcoming DAVI\nmeeting in Detroit.\nAs you know, time had just about run out, and because of that I\nwasn’t able to dig up very much to ship to Ann Arbor. However, the\nfoil caring items were shipped. Air Express, to Mr. Lemler over the\nweekend:\n1. -One poster ... approximately 2^x3* ••• with three Journal\ncovers, plus the lettering \"ASSOCIATION FOR EDUCATION BT\nHADIO-TELEVTSIOTI.n\n2. -One-hundred sample copies of the Journal, with a small and\nrather brief membership flyer pasted on the front cover.\nA copy of this flyer is enclosed.\n3. -One-hundred-seventy copies of a three-page dittoed flyer,\nwhich includes a statement of the objectives of AERT, the\nadvantages of membership, a Hat of national officers and\ndirectors, and a membership blank.\nThe Air Express people promised that this material would arrive\nin Ann Arbor either late Monday afternoon or first thing Tuesday\nmorning. We notified Mr. Lemler by wire, and he wired back that he\nwould be expecting the shipment.\nIs it at all possible for you to arrange to have the poster re¬\nturned to me here In Boston after the DAVI meeting? That would give\nmo a chance to have it refurbished so we could use it again for the\nAFRT conclave in Columbus in April.\nKindest personal regards.\nSincerely,\nJohn Adams Rourke\nrational Membership Chairman\nme AFRT\nenc."
