He also spoke of the value\nof a good radio voice, describing it as\n“a compelling mechanism, frequently\nfar beyond the logic of the position\ntaken . . . Radio is splendid; radio is\npowerful. In terms of public opinion\nradio is not merely dynamite—it is\natomic.”\n\"Silly Talk\"\nHe termed complaints that broad¬\ncasters do not have complete free¬\ndom of speech under the Mayflower\ndecision “silly talk — broadcasters\nwield a tremendous control over the\nnation’s free speech mechanism. They\nselect and define subjects, they choose\nspeakers, they fix times, and indi¬\nvidual employes give the news and\npresent opinions.” He mentioned\nQuincy Howe and H. V. Kaltenborn.\nJohn Dwight Sullivan, counsel for\nthe Advertising Federation of Amer¬\nica, told the Commission his member¬\nship feels that all sides of controver¬\nsial questions should be broadcast,\nbut that “it is our belief and convic¬\ntion that the licensee himself may be\nheard in support of his beliefs, wheth¬\ner or not it be deemed editorializa-\ntion, and that without such rights of\nexpression there will be an end to a\ntrul®Tfree radio,”\nProf. Giraud Chester of Cornell\nUniversity, appearing as an indi¬\nvidual, took issue with Professor\nCushman, who appeared earlier in\nWHCU, Ithaca. He said the May-\nlower decision serves t6 increh.se the\nlkelm§0&~ erf balance on the air.\nHe said that if, for example “all\nfour national networks cast their edi¬\ntorial lot openly with the present\nAdministration in the forthcoming\nelections, a mild form of consterna¬\ntion would break out in certain Con¬\ngressional quarters . . . and those Con¬\ngressmen would have real reason for\ncheir consternation, for while we\nknow that Congressional opinion re¬\nflects public opinion by virtue of reg¬\nular elections, we do not have the\nsame assurance for the opinions of\nbroadcast licensees. We don’t even\nknow the present political leanings\nof licensees. The Commission doesn’t\nhave this information in its files.\n“Having carefully avoided inquiry\ninto such matters, to assume that the\nCommission has somehow, by chance,\nselected several thousand licensees\nwho, in their editorial makeup, will\nreflect the major strains of public\nopinion, seems to me a naive and\nhighly questionable assumption.”\nCriticizes Miller\nChester also struck at the NAB\npresident, Justin Miller, quoting from\na speech by Miller in which the NAB\nleader suggested two reasons why\nbroadcasters should be concerned\nwith freedom of speech—first “a plain\nmatter of dollars and cents” and, sec¬\nond, “that a country cannot continue\nto be free unless its people are free\nto express themselves—to exchange\nideas—without abridgement or cen¬\nsorship by government.”\nStanley Faulkner, for the Voice of\nFreedom Committee, presented the\nCommission with 10,000 signatures to\na petition urging that impartiality in\nbroadcasting be maintained, that\ntrade unions be given time to match\n“industrial sponsors,” and that “many\nliberal commentators dropped from\nthe air in the past year be brought\nback.”\nNathan Straus Gives Views\nNathan Straus, president of WMCA,\nNew York, testifying as an indepen¬\ndent broadcaster, expressed the view\nthat radio station management should\nhave the right to express an opinion\nbut placed a limit on the amount of\ntime that might be devoted to edi¬\ntorializing. He summarized his views\nas follows:\n“D The FCC bases its policies upon\na distinction between the rights and\nprivileges of newspapers and the\nrights and privileges of radio sta¬\ntions. I 'believe the distinction is a\nvalid one based on a real difference.\n“2) It is my belief that the May¬\nflower decision is not the right way\nto deal with this difference.\n“3) I believe that the effect oi the\nprohibition against editorializing on\nthe air is to encourage evasion by\nstations in order that they may ex¬\npress opinion and, in * fact, become\n‘advocates.’\n“4) I believe that the effect of the\ndio advertisers a right which is denie<\nto radio licensees.\n“5) I believe that the Mayflower\ndecision limits access to varying\nshades of opinion in many communi\nties at a moment in the world’s his¬\ntory, when an informed public opin¬\nion is a vital necessity if our country\nis to survive.\n“May I, in closing this statementl\noffer specific suggestions for reconcilf\ning the essential right of freedom of\nopinion with the sound philosophy c\nthe right of government to supervis\nthe use of the air waves. The polic\nthat I advocate takes a middle grounc\nIt avoids both extremes. I do not be\nlieve that radio should have the sam\nright as newspapers to editorialize\nI do not believe in the denial to radi<\nof all right to editorialize. Neither\nextreme serves the public interes\nbest.”\nOffers Recommendations\nContinuing Mr. Straus made defi- j\nnite recommendations to the commis¬\nsion on the subject of editorial opin- ;\nion. These recommendations were:\n“1) Expression of editorial opinion\nshould be permitted to the extent of\n15 minutes a day. For a station which\nis on the air 18 hours, this would\namount to 1.4 per cent of the broad¬\ncast day. For a daytime station which\nis on the air only 12 hours, it would\namount to 2 per cent of the broad¬\ncast day.\n“2) Expression of editorial opinion\nshould be clearly labeled and an¬\nnounced as such, both at the begin¬\nning and at the close of the editorial.\n“3) Stations should be required to\nallocate time, following each edi¬\ntorial period, for letters from the pub¬\nlic. This would give listeners who\ndisagree with the editorial viewpoint\nan opportunity of rebuttal. It would\ncorrespond roughly with the ‘Let¬\nters to the Editor,’ which is a regu¬\nlar feature of the editorial pages of\nmost newspapers.\n“4) The privilege of editorializing\non the air should be confined strictly\nto stations owned by an individual\nor a group, all of whom reside in the\nprimary coverage area of the station.\n“The cure for the evils of democ¬\nracy is more democracy,” Straus con¬\ntinued. “Be it soapbox, pulpit, press,\nor radio, more discussion is the only\nsure road to more enlightenment. The\ndissemination of views as well as\nnews, opinion as well as information,\nwill help people to understand issues\nof the day. I would rather run the\nrisk of permitting propaganda than\nthe risk of muzzling free speech.”\nHearing to Continue Today\nScheduled to be heard today are\nSaul Carson of the New Republic,\nAttorney Theodore Pierson for a\nnumber of client stations, Milton\nStewart for the American Jewish\nCongress and Charles Siepmann, au¬\nthor of “Radio’s Second Chance” and\ncompiler of much of the material of\nthe FCC controversial Blue Book."
