C.\nSEP 2 0 1961\nA Hi\n■?l?l?|W(H|i2|i|2|3|4|g|S\nDear Bill:\nWhat about your attending the NETRC Affiliates\nmeeting in New York just ahead of NAEB?\nHave you been invited by the Center to attend?\nDo you expect to be invited? Or can I invite\nyou as an additional representative of our\nstation? Or will Mac invite you as an addit¬\nional member of WHA-TV?\nI would hope that Jack or Jim would invite you\nout of their desire to maintain good working\nrelationship with NAEB -- but if they don't and\nyou can and will attend, I'd be glad to have you\ncome up under my colors.\nYou probably know the meeting is at the Barbizon\nPlaza startling Thursday noon, October 19th and\nrunning thru lunch on Saturday. Those of us on\nthe NAEB Board should probably go down to Washington\nSaturday afternoon to be there for the NAEB Board\nmeeting Sunday morning -- right?\nLet me know if there is anything you would like me\nto do on this.\nLoren B.
