  "text": "The Elephant\nProgram: The great, great, great granddaddy of all elephants, was a little animal\nabout 2 feet tall, who had no trunk and no tusks. The first elephant didn’t need a trunk.\nHe could reach grass easily. Then as some millions of years went by, the elephant grew\nbigger and his trunk grew down so he could reach the grass.\nThe “Mastodon” elephant was 10 feet tall with tusks about 9 feet long. During the\nice age the “Mammoth” elephant stood over 14 feet. He wore a woolly coat. When the\nearth got warm again he disappeared. His relatives are found in India and Africa (the\none with the big ears).\nToday’s elephant is smaller. He uses his strong trunk to lift things, to drink, to take\na shower and to breathe. It’s really his nose.\nDomesticated elephants can be taught a number of words and commands. They do\na great deal of heavy work for man. Lots of wild elephants still live in the jungles as\nthey have for millions of years.\nNote:\nThree other programs will be done on this series. Production work had not reached a point, at\nthe time this booklet went to press, to permit detailing the subject content. We do know that the\nother programs will deal with The Beaver, The Giraffe and The Horse."
