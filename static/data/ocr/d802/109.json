I would\nsay this: while the organist is not exceptional, he is quite\ngood. The literature he covers in the 26 programs is compre¬\nhensive, and well enough done*\nI don't think we would want to carry the\nseries since we have such an abundance of fine organists here--\nbetter organists than Putnam Porter. However, I imagine there\nare many other stations that would welcome such a series, and\nfor this reason, I would vote for it. Yes!\nThe quality of the first recording (#9) was\ngood, but the second was pretty bad. It was full of wows,\nenough to make it unplayable. I don't know whether this\noccurred in the original recording, or merely in the process\nof dubbing*\nCordial I y,\nl~-<S>cxJ2 d O\nWaldo Abbot\ndirector of Broadcasting\nWA:mv RECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nSEP 15 1954\nMf PM\n7|8|9|ip(ll|K|l|2|8|4|5|?\ni"
