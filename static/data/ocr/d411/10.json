However, I cannot see the value\n(in amount of $1215) for NAEB as an association.\nI fear that spending our monies for this purchase\nmight wound some NAEB members, and this I would\nhate to do.\nWhat really makes it difficult for me\nto recommend purchase is the lack of good reason\n(good uses to which it might be put) for purely\nresearch needs* Perhaps I miss the emphasis\nMerrill intends to give the needs, but I've re-read\nthem and they fail to impress me.\nBasically, I’m not overly concerned about\nnose counting for any of the educational stations.\nThis is not to say, the more the better of quality\nlisteners for all of us.\nQuite frankly, I’m somewhat concerned\nat the poll of station managers. Four of the seven\nare on the Board and could have voted their reactions.\nMy motion was intended to get non-Board, non-Research\nCommittee member views.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFESfb"
