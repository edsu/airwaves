HYER\nAssistant Secretary\nSince much of the thinking that is being done by the members\nof our two organizations is concerned with some of the same\neducational and national problems, I am hoping that DAVI can\nbe represented at the convention by a number of members. For\nexample, Keith Tyler and Harold Wigren are Co-Ch iraen of our\nNational Committee on Educational Television. If they are able\nto be at the convention, would it be possible to give them some\nform of recognition as official representatives of DAVI?\nAlso, several of our most valued members are on the campus of\nthe University of Oklahoma. I am hoping that it will be pos¬\nsible for William Fulton, who Is Co-Chairman of our National\nCommittee on Teacher Education, and Robert de Kieffer, who is\nChairman of our National Committee on College and University\nPrograms, to take part in the NAEB Convention.\nFLORENCE IH-CHI FAN\nAdministrative Assistant\nMARY C. WELCH\nAdministrative Assistant\nThe tentative draft of your program seems to me to be exceptionally\ncomprehensive and valuable. It is a convention that I certainly\nhate to miss.\nSince your organization is interested in the broad field of communi¬\ncation, I wonder if it would be possible for us to arrange to have\non exhibit copies of our new professional journal, Audio-Visual\nComraunication Review, and also have an opportunity to have someone"
