And\nthen tho President went back down the hill to his executive offices in the\nWhite House.\nHe subsequently has sent up to the Hill various messages, asking the\nCongress to enact specific adminlstrat .on programs into law and to appropriate\nthe necessary money to finance those programs. From time to time he may use\nthe power and prestige of his great office to attempt to persuade the lawmakers\nto enact a particular measure -* or perhaps to block one which his administra¬\ntion opposes.\nBut it's entirely possible that the Resident will not return to Capitol\nHill in person for the rest of this legislative session. He would resent\nsenators and congressmen coming to the White House and trying to run the exe¬\ncutive branch for him, and he knows that they are Jealous of the powers of their\ncoordinate branch and resent too much interference from the executive.\nBut let's suppose for a moment that the President was an elected member\nof the House of Representatives from his native state of Kansas.\nAnd let's suppose that every memoer of the President1a cabinet was either\na congressman or senator.\nAnd now let's suppose that after delivering that message on the State of\nthe Union in January, the President had to sit there in the well of the House\nof Representatives while the House debated his program.\nSuppose he had to sit there at a bench located just under speaker Martin's\nrostrum, flanked by the members of his Cabinet, andhear himself and hi a program\nraked over and over by vigorous and sarcastic and sometimes vitriolic critics.\nAnd let's carry it one atop further?\nsuppose that after sitting through all this debate, the President and his\ncabinet had to remain on that bench during & ro 11call vote of the House which\nwould determine not only the fate of the program, but actually whether the\nEisenhower administration would stay in office or be thrown out."
