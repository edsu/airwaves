Will you oil serve?\nHLease? I*a like Ed Burrous to serve as Chairman. Ok, Ed?\nOne reason I*m marking in advance is that I don’t care for the usual\ntype of resolutions ve have. These could, I thinls^he very significant.\nOhe Chairman should checlc vlth Citations & Awards Committee Chainnaa\nSohooley for possible overlap in case of possible resolutions of thanks\nor recognition. The Convention Committee, Hotel, Exhlbitoxe, and possibly\nothers should have resolutions of thanks. But we need more — if possible\nfor presentation at the bang,uet (vith Citations Committee}. Qiere can be\na little levity.\ndne area for a possible resolution: In our foreign aid bills, telecoDDaml-\ncations are left out. Yet in underdeveloped nations this could be one of\ngreatest boons to education and literacy. A dedaration of our eoncern for\nsuch -world problems, and on urging for Inclusion of aid in setting up systems\nvould be of use. (One factory in one countiy may cost $6 million. We could\nhelp a doaen whole countries with educational radio and TV for that, for\nexample.)"
