Copies of th3s will be sent\nto you tomorrow (Tuesday, August 15) from that office.\nAs soon as we receive copies here (a day or two later),\nI will send you another \"safety” copy with a covering\nnote.\nX trust that the budget for the coming year, sent\nyou earlier, the attached fiscal report for the past\nyear, and the forthcoming program report provide you\nwith the necessary information to permit you to issue\nthe check for $26,800 for the final year of the Grant.\nHowever, if you have any questions, or desire any\nfurther information, please let me know.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G.
