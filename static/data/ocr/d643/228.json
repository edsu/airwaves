X can see good reason for continuing\npreviously begun contacts, like BBC, HTF, Sweden. But what\nof those foreign broadcasting services we have not worked\nwith in the past? Here we either deal through BFA, or we\ndon•t• If we do, then we should authorize BFA to speak for\nus in certain situations, but should know in advance exactly\nwhat commitments they/he make/makes in our name; that is,\nthere should be no \"selling\" of foreign broadcasting groups\non providing programs to BFA partly so BFA can serve NAEB as\na corporate entity unless we are somewhat in on planning and\noperations. On the other hand, if BFA deals only with\ncertain individual NAEB stations, that is another thing.\nBut BFA should not use our name in vain! Here I think\nclarification is needed.\nI have decided to change my travel schedule in order to\ncover the EBU meeting on commercial television which will be\nheld in London under ITA auspices from May 21 through 23.\nBut I111 still cover the EBU radio meeting in Home from\nMay 27 through 31l the change is only in my itinerary between\nLondon and Home.\nBefore Home, If& like more guidance on the Prlx Italia.\nHarry wrote to say that this had fallen to BFA as a fait\naccompli. But I*d like more information. When I'm asked in\nRome about Prix Italia, do I just say flatly, \"That#e now in\nBFA#s hands,\" or what?\nI hope you had a good time at Columbus. Let me know\nwhatever transpired that*s of particular interest, especially\npertaining to NAEB.\nBP ids"
