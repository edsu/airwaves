C. 20036\nDear Jim:\nToday i sent a letter off to Marcus Cohn telling him that l was\npleased that the two of you had decided to hire a special editor for\nthe monograph on the social revolution. Enclosed you will find two\narticles that you sent me from the New York Times which ! am returning\nsince these may be of special interest to the new editor. Also, !\nam sending along a manuscript from Ann Wilkens on closed circuit\ntelevision in the ghettos. It has definite possibilities for this\nspecial issue.\nWhile ! was recently in New York l talked with Russell Barber\nabout two programs that he is producing that seem rather unique In\nreference to the problems of the Negro. Perhaps he should also be\ncontacted. Professors Lynch and Brooks are preparing a special article\non the communication curricula at Shaw University for Negro students.\nAgain, this material may fit in this issue.\nThanks again for your kind hospitality while i was recently in\nWashington.\nSineerely\nAllen E.
