This activity has now been curtailed\nat a time which we feel is unfortunate since solid services were beginning to\nbe developed in many locations in which the Fund for the Advancement of\nEducation and other organizations have a vital Interest, and many of which\nthey support.\nIt Is essential that educational stations keep pace with technical\nadvances, and that current Installations not become tomorrow's albatross,\nor not be such as to greatly hamper what TV, adequately Implemented, can do.\nThere is presently no one in the movement to insure against this. The NAEB\nEngineer kept the NAEB membership Informed on new technical developments\nwhich came to mean a great deal both from financial and quality considera¬\ntions through the Newsletter and the Engineering Newsletter as well as by\noriginal reports and reprints of papers distributed to managerial and ETV tech¬\nnical personnel. The Video Recording Workshop, mentioned above, was an\nillustration of this Informational and technical training service.\nOperating ETV stations were represented on the Television Allocations\nStudy Organization by the NAEB Engineer, and educational television represen-\nta..on on many other Important boards and government agencies was Insured\nby the active participation of the NAEB Engineer. Since travel funds and\nStaffs at most educational Institution* are limited, no satisfactory solution\nto the problem created by his departure has been found."
