C.\nDear Bill:\nI'm sorry that I didn't get ray answer to your query via Sam Becker off in time\nfor inclusion in Sam's recent communication, Since the response is not unani¬\nmous, I think I'd better put in ray two cents' worth even now.\nOn the whole, my position is most like that of Kumata. The points I'd like to\nunderscore are these:\n1) There are numerous private groups anxious to serve broadcasters interested\nin getting research data on their audiences. On the whole they can do the job\nmore cheaply and uniformly than we could do it under the aegis of the national\noffice,\n2) Furthermore, they can meet the usual conditions more readily than we can-\nclient control over content of survey, client control of publication, etc,\n3) Many of us cannot meet these conditions at all. The University of Wisconsin\ndoes not permit the use of its name in connection with purely commercial research\nwhen contol of content and publication is not in the hands of the researcher,\nI'm sure we are not alone in thi3.\nk) It would be all but impossible to guarantee a user uniform quality under the\ncircumstances you describe, Duch uniformity could probably not be enforced by\nthe proposal ofiice without making the proposal excessively unattractive,\nS) Many of us are still interested in the dynamics of audiences in relation to\ncontent. But the usual commercial survey rarely add3 to our mite of knowledge.\nAnd it is unfortunately true that routine audience surveys tend to justify the\nbroadcaster in not taking risks, not trying something new, not worrying about\ngrave local issues that nevertheless lack the drawing power of Lawrence Welk.\nDoes NAEB want to associate itself with such a ba? .ness?\nAs usual, I'm hopeful for any way NAEB can help us get significant research done\non broadcasting. But this proposal as it stands does not appear to be the ave¬\nnue we are seeking*\nSincerely,\nBHW:bfm\nCC: Samuel L, Becker\nBruce H, Hatley\nAssociate Professor"
