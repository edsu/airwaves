C.\nDear Mr. Hill:\nWith regard to your memo of June 14, we have no strong opinion\nfor or against John Finster's proposal. Although San Diego State\noperates the same kind of school year as Mr. Finster outlines,\nKEBS is on the air 52 weeks of the year, and so this would offer\nno particular advantage for us. Neither, to my knowledge, would\nit offer any particular disadvantage.\nAssociate Professor, Speech Arts\nProgram Director, KEBS (FM)\nFWN:bm"
