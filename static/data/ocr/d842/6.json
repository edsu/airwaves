First, it\nis not a matter of race or blood type. The way of life that we have is different\nfrom the Tlingit Indians, or from other people, and this difference is due to the\ndifferent ways we have learned. No anthropologist today believes that any important\ndifferences in group behavior are caused by differences in race. Another thing:\nculture is not merely habits or customs. To be sure, customs are a part of culture,\nbut culture is the integration and the unity of these customs and habits.\nSet Apart\nThe fact that we humans live according to culture sets us apart from all the\nworld's other creatures. Since culture is learned behavior, culture can be changed\nto meet and to master new situations. It makes it possible for us to live in the\nArctic and in the tropics, in the forest and on deserts.
