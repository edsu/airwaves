We might not under¬\nstand their frustrations. But we need to listen. \"\nCONTACT: Don Schein, General Manager\n* * * * *\nAuburn Television, over the Alabama Educational Network is readying\nits initial programming for the rural disadvantaged for early 1969 airing.\nTentatively titled \"KATIE'S HOUSE, the twice weekly, quarter hour\nprograms will try to \"reach the unreached\", the rural homemakers who fall\ninto a lower socio-economic-educational level - women who have not been so\nfar exposed to TV teaching that is designed expressly for their capabilities.\nThe series is being produced by Auburn staff Producer-Director John\nBrockway.
