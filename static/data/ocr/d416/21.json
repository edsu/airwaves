For instance, the\naverage station would like to receive eight or more quarter-hour programs each\nweek: but whether the Network can distribute that many depends on the number and\nquality of such programs available. Nevertheless, knowing what is desired, we\ncan do our best to find and supply such programs.\nNot every station answered every question, and a few answers had to be\n\"interpreted0 to be usable at all. Still we believe that we now have a pretty\naccurate picture of this aspect of the Network operation. And, while this\n\"study\" is quite narrow, in no way academic, and conceived purely as an aid\nto the Network Headquarters in its work, we are sure you would like to have a\nlook at the results.\nJH:jy"
