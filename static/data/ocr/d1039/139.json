  "text": "It is evident that the one channel in the southeastern part of the\nstate cannot serve the sparsely settled rural areas of the state that\nneed to bolster their educational facilities. To serve the needs\ndetermined by analysis of the general survey data and a study of the\nengineering survey, there should be an educational reservation at Casper\nin what is considered by many the state's most populous and prosperous\narea; another around Sheridan, Rock Springs, and Powell; and others in\nsome of the extreme western and extreme northeastern areas. At least 13\nadditional reservations should be made for Wyoming's future educational\nneeds."
