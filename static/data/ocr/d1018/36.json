His name is Theodore Sorensen and in a time of sorrow here is what he wrote.\n\"Ours is a generation under pressure, engaged in a struggle we did not start and a world we\ndid not make. We cling to the old hopes of freedom and peace. But first, we must halt new\nterrors to tyranny and war, and our generation has been chosen to usher in either a new\ngeneration of terror or a generation of hope. For if the world cannot be saved by the spirit\nof youth, it cannot hope to save the spirit of the ages. And we who are young among men\nserve our society to preserve what is as old as man: his quest for peace and freedom. We\ndo not despair for that ancient quest today is the ocean crest of tomorrow. No hand of iron\ncan stay it, no wall of stone can confine it. A single breaker may recede but the tide is\ncoming in. ‚Äù"
