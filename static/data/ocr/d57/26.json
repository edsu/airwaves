  "text": "President Lynn White, jr,, Barnard Forum, 2/8/58 -- 10\nlively and significant part of the total educational structure of the country; but\nthey touch only a small fraction of children* So, I believe. Independent colleges\nand universities will continue to prosper among us, but that their proportionate\ncontribution to American life and thought will be much reduced as the decades pass*\nIn conclusion, however, letâ€™s recognize that the Independent institutions will\nbe kept healthy not only by the sort of objective appraisal which I have tried to\nprovide for you, but also by loyalty and even by passion* As one who graduated from\nan Independent university, did all his post-graduate work and teaching In similar\nInstitutions, and who now for fifteen years has presided over a small college\nreplete with adventurousness, I myself believe passionately in the importance of\nmaintaining such campuses at the highest Intellectual level* America needs them as\nan essential element In its pluralistic society* The state colleges and universities\nneed them as foils, need them as surety against standardization, need them as\nbarriers to the overgrowth of educational bureaucracy. But academic loyalties have\ntoo often been clothed In cliches and outmoded assumptions* Unless these are quickly\nabandoned, they will become the winding-sheets of independent higher education*"
