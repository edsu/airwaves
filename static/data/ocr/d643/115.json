This process may Involve\nnot only the leaders of the various groups most directly\nconcerned, but also some outside advisors. Perhaps those\nfoundations interested in supporting educational broadcasting\nshould also participate. In any event, both the JCST and the\nNASB should inform the Ford Foundation of the plans in this\nrespect.\nIt is difficult to foresee the eventual outcome of such\na group self-appraisal. It could lead to basic changes, both\nwithin and among these several organizations. It might result\nin internal changes of structure, In the merging of two or\nmore of the groups, or in the setting up of new organizations.\nIn the last analysis, of course, it would not necessarily\nenhance the role of the NAEB, nor alter its relationship to\nthe work now being done by the JCST. Our purpose is to\nadvance the cause of educational television, not to place the\nJCET in a defensive position.\nWith best personal regards,\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP:ds"
