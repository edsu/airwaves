W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nPlease excuse the delay in responding to your letter of February 1. I\nwould be pleased to accept the chairmanship of this committee again,\nthough I am somewhat chagrined by the fact that, in my opinion, we made\nno contribution to the NAEB last year. I hope that we can this year.\nThis suggested committee is fine with me. Sherk is the only one whom\nI do not know.\nBy the way, have you had a chance yet to think over the suggestions\n(involving the research committee) which I sent to you? If so, do you\nhave any reactions? In addition to, or instead of, these, are there\nother contributions which you are hoping for from the committee in 1961?\nSee you in Washington one of these days.\nCordially,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLB:ks"
