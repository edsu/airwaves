I dicta*t include in our tentative\nminutes anything about the decals because the idea was not\nofficially rejected. Flynn indicated his objection to the idea,\nMamet told ms cm the side that he liked the idea, and I couldn't\nsee that there was much opinion one way or another from the rest of\nthe group. At the proper time, I am going to get Cornell's ideas.\nI still think the idea is a good one and I do not believe the idea\nshould be discredited simply because there was a dissent from one\nmember, taking into consideration his personality and all of that\n(this is all confidential to you and Harold, of course).\nI have the feeling like you did that Tom Petry would have made a\nmore substantial contribution to the work of the committee than\nhe did had he been allowed to say anything, and I am going to\n*tap” his thoughts at the proper time.\nI want to assure you that the PR Committee will not be a dead\ncommittee and maybe we can get more done by correspondence than\notherwise. Meanwhile, you and Harold kick in with your ideas as\nthey come to you.\nRegarding our trip home, you have the intuition of a woman (which\nyou are)-—antiques prevailed! Best personal regards.\nCordially yours.\nElmer 0. Sulzer, Director\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGSxram\ncc: H. H. Hllll-"
