Schooley\nLoren Stone\nVernon Bronson\nFrom: li Je Skfirnia\nSubject: Nie/sen Study\nDate: January IU, 1958\n- Gentleman:\nMinutes of the St, Louis Board meeting (Tuesday, October 29, 1957)\nrea* as\n03 Headquarters introduced a letter from Irving R. Merrill of the\nResearch Committee to the Board of Directors explaining a Research Committee\nrecommendation that NAEB purchase \"NCS #2\", a nation-wide radio and\ntelevision coverage study as conducted in the spring of 1956 by the Nielsen\nCompany of Chciago. Details of such a purchase were described in the\nrecommendation * The Board reviewed the pros and cons of such a proposal\nincluding Value received, the need for such information, possible uses, and\nreactions of Association members. Since reactions to the proposal varied so\ngreatly, it was not approved and the consensus was the the Board needed\nadditional advice. Accordingly, Schooley moved that headquarters get reactions\nfrom a representative group of at least five radio and/or television station\nmanagers, inviting them to study the proposal and made recommendations.\nHeadquarters will then collate this material for action by the Board. Schenkkan\nseconded and approval granted with Bronson recorded as dissenting.â€™9\nI have j ust today received this material from Irving Merrill, and am\nsending out at once.\nWould you therefore, as soon as you can, provide the recommendations\nrequested ?\nSince the action called for its sending to \" at least five99 in both\nradio and TV I hope the selection, a combination of suggestions of Merrill\n(for 4) and mine (for 3) will be satisfactory."
