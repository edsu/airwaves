C.\nPRELIMINARY REPORT\nEducational Television Programs Institute\nPennsylvania State College, April 20-24, 1952\nA Milestone in American Education\nThe Educational Television Programs Institute, sponsored by the American\nCouncil on Education and held on the campus of Pennsylvania State College,\nApril 20-24, in my opinion will be a milestone in the never-ending search for\nmore effective ways of extending educational values to our people. I realize\nthat this is a bold claim to stake out. Yet, I think it is fair to say that\npolicy recommendations of far-reaching significance for realizing the education¬\nal potential of television were formulated at Penn State. The level of policy\nconsideration at the Institute seemed to be fully up to the dimensions of the\ntelevision problem -- and opportunity -- which confronts educators today, and\nthis is the surest reason I see for confidence that the challenge to education\nwhich is afforded by the mushrooming growth of television will be met.\nThere seemed to me to be clear evidence at the conclusion of the Institute\nof unanimous concern that educational groups take forthwith the steps necessary\nto establish and develop educational television stations on the channels re¬\nserved for educational use. This was recognized as an opportunity to which\nurgent and devoted effort must be given. A problem of overwhelming concern\nto the entire group was to make possible the establishment of working coopera¬\ntion between educational television stations. Recommendations were approved"
