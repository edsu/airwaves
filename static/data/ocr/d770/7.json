BOX 487, SYDNEY 2001\nTELEPHONE: 31-0211\nCABLES: \"ABCOM\" SYDNEY\nAUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION,\nBROADCAST HOUSE,\n145 ELIZABETH STREET,\nSYDNEY, AUSTRALIA\nNew Zealand Broadcasting Corportation\nEXCHANGE OF SHORT FILMS ON FARMING\nRESPONSES TO QUESTIONNAIRE\nORIGINATED BY NZBC\nP/20\nQuestion 1\nFox* what purpose are items mainly required? (e.g. basic instruction,\ngeneral information, advanced instruction.)\nABC: \"New farming ideas, machinery and scientific advances. New\npastures and crops. Improved livestock and management.\n(Advanced instruction and general information.)\"\nNHK: \"We prefer items delightfully introducing the land, people and\nproducts of the country concerned through portrayal of rural\nlife and functions. Those introducing drastic inventions of\nnew techniques or new researches in farming would also be of\ninterest to us.\"\nComment: \"The majority of the contributions being supplied to\nthis exchange concern subjects dealing with production\ntechniques of farm products. We find films of such\ncontents of little use as farming techniques of other\ncountries differ greatly from those of Japan. This\nwould not apply in the case of a very spectacular farm\ntechnique development,\"\nNZBC: \"General information and advanced instruction. General\ninformation mainly, as most material seen so far has limited\napplication in New Zealand.\"\nRTH: \"(a) Advanced instruction:\n(c) general information.\"\n(b) basic instruction\nHAR: \"Introduction of new techniques in agriculture and animal breeding.\"\nSummary:\nGeneral impression is that descriptive material of ordinary techniques\nis not required; most indicate the basic requirement is for material for\nadvanced instruction, particularly that showing radical technical\ndevelopments,"
