I had looked for¬\nward to sitting down with you and discussing this\nUtilisation Information Kit Project. By now I*111 sure\nLis Marshall has told you of our discussion. I had\nintended to write you sooner but have held off, pend¬\ning a reply to my official request to Dr. Willis.\nThis letter went to him on January litth and I am be¬\nginning to wonder if something may have happened to\nhis reply since I have not heard from him as yet. In\nany case, I sent him another letter today.\nIt would be impossible for me to cover in a letter\nall of the details and Kit possibilities that we dis¬\ncussed. Basically, what we would like to have is a\nKit of slides with an accompanying tape recording demon¬\nstrating utilisation of school broadcasts in the Chicago\nschools. We would like to have these organised in such\na way that they would be aimed at a specific audience.\nThe committee hopee to extend this project over\nseveral years if necessary. Our first objective is to\nfind the existing material and see if this can be made\navailable. After this is done, we hope to secure the\nfunds to produce specific Utilisation Kits to fill in\nthose areas where material is lacking.\nAs for the form these kits will take, we envisage\nthe use of films, tape recordings, film stripes, slides,\nmodels, planned demonstrations and printed material.\nThe committee is not trying to set up a specific format\nfor the Kits, but would like to keep their planning\nflexible enough to make use of every type of present¬\nation.\n»"
