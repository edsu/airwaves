This should arrive in the\nnext week and then we will start the several-months-project of reviewing\nthese files and integrate them into our present ones. I believe this\nis the only practical approach to this problem. I could not possibly\nhave spent enough time in Ames to carefully review the files there. In\nthis manner I can lay aside those that need clarification and discuss\nthem with Hull or others concerned at our convenience.\nI am processing the Convention report and will send it to the people\nyou mentioned.\nI was glad to see that Bill Singer has again come to life. Incidentally,\nI understand that Wally Krulevitch is out at the UniversLty of Cal¬\nifornia.\nI believe that this is all far now. I sincerely hope that we will\nhave the opportunity to discuss some of these matters between meetings\non the Lowell Project.\nSincerely,\nJSMiWC\nJim Miles\nExecutive Director"
