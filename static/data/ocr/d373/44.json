TvB Cooperation\nThe Television Advertising Bureau has been working with\nus in helping keep all television stations informed of the\nwork of the Youth Opportunity Council and your participation.\nThis has been in the form of a story on the advertising industry's\nYouth Opportunity activity in the TvB bulletin, and a letter\nto every television station in the country. A personal P.S.\nfrom Pete Cash, president of the TvB, was added to each letter\nsent to each television station in the 50 major cities. Pete's\nnote went to all stations in each major market, whe.ther a\nmember of the Bureau or not.\n3. Press Report\nAs mentioned in my last memorandum, we are planning a\nreport to the press of your activities. As a result of disÂ¬\ncussions with John Crichton and Larry Reedy, this is being\ntentatively planned for early in September. Shortly after that,\na formal report will be produced for distribution to Vice\nPresident Humphrey and the other members of the Youth Opportunity\nCouncil (the members of the Cabinet) and members of the National\nTaskforce"
