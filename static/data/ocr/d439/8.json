First of all, a copy of the letter received\ntoday from Paulu, to be sure you know as much as I do jjfou probably know more,\nbut I wanted to be sure.\nHave received several protests regarding shortness of notice on the\nPrix Italia* Since I received the stuff from you on Saturday, June 26, and got\nit ready over the week-end and in the mail on Monday, June 23, before leaving on\na trip, I’m telling all protestors that I couldn’t have done much faster. I am\nsorry for the short deadline, though, because I do feel more and better entries,\nand more help from the Committee, might have been possible, if we’d had a couple\nof more weeks. Since m listed tomorrow as ths deadline, how do things look?\nHerewith also a letter from the KARTS, and my reply. Ae stated, I do\nnot have a copy of the release you sent. Could you automatically send us a copy\nof all such releases (and the one now) ao we can present ae united a front with\nyou as possible? It leaves ae a little up in the air not to have such things,\nand I think we should probably have file copies and extras to sand direct as a\nmatter of routine, anyway. In this case, I’ve used the technique of \"a soft\nanswer tumeth away-—*.\nI guess we've both become increasingly busy, but somehow I feel that\nour liaison isn’t as good as it used to be. Anything I ean do from this end?\nI don't ever want anything to be endangered by failure to provide ae\nfull cooperation as possible from this end.\nOff to Washington this next week again. Hate to be away, since Hill\nis also on vacation, and it leaves the office undermanned, but I guess this is\nthe way ths world goes.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSswe"
