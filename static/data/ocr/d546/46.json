Gable\nDirector of Radio and T\\T Education\nSchool District of Philadelphia\nBoard of Public Education\nParkway at Twent^First Street\nPhiladelphia 3, Pennsylvania\nDear mss Gablet\nFinally !*« getting beck to your letter regarding an article for the\nNAEB Journal on \"Operation Alphabet*\" In looking over your letter, the\nnewspaper column, and the letter from the president of the Board of\nPublic Education, I think the story of \"Cperation Alphabet\" would make\nan excellent article for the journal.\nHowever, it would be much better if you, or someone on your staff, could\nwrite a complete article...say, 1500 to 2000 words^-compljete with pictures,\nif you have any that would illustrate the story. A good lead would be the\nbit about Dr. Shevlin beginning with the two paintings by Grandma Moses.\nI hope you* 11 be able to find time to do this, as I think it would make an\ninteresting addition to the journal. For our readership of educational\nbroadcasters, you would not be amiss if you went into greater detail than\nthe materials you sent—If you gave such things as lesson plans, etc.\n1 shall he looking forward to hearing from you—in the affirmative, I\nhope.\nSincerely yours.\n(Mrs.) Betty ftsKenzie\nPublications Editor\nBMD/dp\nblocs Walter B. Emery\nHarold E. Hill,/"
