Beyond this, I think it was recognized: (l) that\ncooperation with commercial stations can provide helpful experience in advance\nof operation of educational stations; (2) that in some areas, where sufficient\nreserved channels are not available, this may be the only practicable way of\nextending educational services over television; and (3) that continuing coopera¬\ntion with commercial stations and networks would in any case be desirable in\norder to bring to the broad audiences which these stations have attracted a select¬\nion of programs of genuine educational significance.\nQuite apart from all of the valuable factual material made available in\nthe written statements distributed at the Institute and in the speeches and\ndiscussion sessions, I am convinced that the Institute's most significant con¬\ntribution lay in suggesting for all of the participants the immense potential\nof television for helping to achieve that fundamental American objective of\ninforming and educating our citizens in ways which will permit maximum develop¬\nment of the individual within the community. It was gratifying to see how the\nrealization that this is the central and historic objective of our educational\ninstitutions led the group toward a determination that television in all of\nits forms must be used to do a better job — the necessary job — of extending\neducational services to Americans.\nArthur S. Adams, President\nAmerican Council on Education"
