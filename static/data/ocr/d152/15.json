  "text": "AMERICAN CHAMBER MUSIC\nThe advancement of chamber music performance in America during the past\ntew years has been accompanied by an enormous increase in the number -— and\nquality — of chamber music works composed by Americans. During the nineteenth\ncentury a composition for a small instrumental combination from the pen of an\nAmerican composer was a rarity, though there was no shortage of symphonies,\noperas, piano pieces, and many other forms of music. Today this genre is the\nprincipal means of expression for many of our most gifted composers.\nThe years since World War II have been years not only of great development\nof American chamber music, but of the universal recognition of that music, and of\nits dissemination to many corners of the world. This phenomenon, which continues\nundiminished, is due in considerable degree to the influx, and subsequent assimilation\ninto our culture, of many of the world's greatest composers during the I930's.\nThe summer series of chamber music concerts at the Museum presents a varied\nand typical cross-section of the chamber music being created today by Americans,\nnative and transplanted. Some of these works will grow in stature with the years,\nothers will be forgotten. At the concerts, players and listeners alike will be contribut¬\ning to that historical process—and, we are sure, finding much pleasure in so doing.\n—Robert Turner\nFelix Slatkin, Violin\nPaul Shure, Violin\nQuartet in A Minor, Op. 41\nQuartet No. I *\nQuartet in E Minor\nJULY 2\nHOLLYWOOD STRING QUARTET\nPaul Robyn, Viola\nEleanor Aller, Cello\nRobert Schumann\nWalter Piston\nBedrich Smetana\nJULY 9\nPHILHARMONIC TRIO\nWilliam Kurasch, Violin Maxine Furman, Piano\nJoseph DiTullio, Cello Franklyn Stokes, Clarinet, Guest Artist\nTrio in E Flat for Violin, Celio & Piano, Op 100 .....
