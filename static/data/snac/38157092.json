One of the activities used to accomplish this function is the administering of executive decisions and actions. This series consists of correspondence, reports, telegrams, agendas, newspaper clippings, and various publications regarding colleges, universities, reform schools, state hospitals, and other institutions funded by the state of Alabama.  Most of the routine correspondence was handled by George Bliss Jones, Governor Chauncey Sparks' secretary. The majority of the files provide information on the colleges and universities in the state.  In addition to the two largest institutions, the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Alabama Polytechnic Institute in Auburn, the state maintained Alabama College in Montevallo; A ? Tuskegee Institute; and the State Teacher Colleges at Florence, Jacksonville, Livingston, Montgomery, and Troy. Events of special note include the establishment of a four-year medical school in Birmingham.  The files contain correspondence, reports, and minutes of the Building Commission for the Four-Year Medical School.  A statement from the Alabama Educational Survey Commission challenging the timing for building and funding the new school is contained in the records.  These files also document the development of a veterinary program at Tuskegee Institute.  Governor Sparks' interest in the growth of agricultural programs in the state is reflected in the Tuskegee files and those of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute.  The state also established an Engineering, Science, and Management Defense Training (ESMDT) Program for Negroes in conjunction with the Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the University of Alabama.  The Governor's records also reveal Sparks' role in reinstituting the Auburn-Alabama football rivalry that had been dormant since 1907. This series also contains reports and correspondence on the Alabama Insane Hospitals.  In addition to correspondence with W.D. Partlow, superintendent of the entire system, there is correspondence from patients at the hospitals and family members of patients.  There is also information on the Alabama Citizens' Committee to Serve in the Interest of the State Hospitals and Public Health, including correspondence from the organization's secretary, Hopson Owen Murfee.  Alabama's mental health facilities suffered greatly during World War II due to a shortage in personnel to staff the hospitals. Other state institutions documented in this series include the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind, Alabama Boys Industrial School at East Lake, the Alabama Reform School for Negro Boys at Meigs, the Alabama School of Trades at Gadsden, the Alabama Vocational School for Girls at Birmingham, and the Alabama Training School for Girls at East Lake. <\/abstract>\n                  <name>\n                     <namePart>Unknown<\/namePart>\n                     <role>\n                        <roleTerm valueURI=\"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/relators\/rps\">Repository<\/roleTerm>\n                     <\/role>\n                  <\/name>\n               <\/mods>\n            <\/objectXMLWrap>",

This series documents visually the various state and local projects that were administered in the state of Alabama. The series consists of photographic prints and negatives used to produce a pictorial report of CWA projects in Alabama. The prints used in the report are mounted in two large albums. A separate set of loose duplicate prints arranged to correspond with the albums is also available. The set of loose prints contains a few extra prints that are not included in the albums. The finding aid to the albums notes for which counties extra prints are available. If no negative existed for an extra print, two copies of the print, if available, were retained in the loose print file. The quality of the photography and developing process varies from county to county resulting in clear sharp images for some counties and badly faded ones for others. The photographs are divided into two categories. The first category, contained in Volume I only, consists of aerial views taken for the State Aviation Dept. These images are predominantly views of airport construction at various municipalities but aerial prints of the campus at Auburn University; the Shades Valley Disposal Plant (Birmingham, Ala.); the fish hatchery at Marion, Ala.; and the construction of the levee at Elba, Ala. are also included. The second category of prints found in the rest of Volume I and all of Volume II were taken for the Safety and Compensation Dept. and are arranged alphabetically by county. These photographs document the following projects: road construction and improvements; construction of airports; sanitation improvements; construction and\/or maintenance of public buildings such as schools (including colleges and universities), courthouses, tuberculosis sanatoriums, poor or alms houses, and community centers; and \"women's industries\" such as mattress-making, sign shops, and, in the case of Pickens County, road work. Although the photographs were created to document the various CWA projects, this series as a whole provides an excellent social commentary on Alabama and its citizens in the early 1930s. <\/abstract>\n                  <name>\n                     <namePart>Unknown<\/namePart>\n                     <role>\n                        <roleTerm valueURI=\"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/relators\/rps\">Repository<\/roleTerm>\n                     <\/role>\n                  <\/name>\n               <\/mods>\n            <\/objectXMLWrap>",

                "abstract": "The function of the Civil Works Administration was to provide work for unemployed persons to help them through the winter of 1933-1934. This series documents visually the various state and local projects that were administered in the state of Alabama. The series consists of photographic prints and negatives used to produce a pictorial report of CWA projects in Alabama. The prints used in the report are mounted in two large albums. A separate set of loose duplicate prints arranged to correspond with the albums is also available. The set of loose prints contains a few extra prints that are not included in the albums. The finding aid to the albums notes for which counties extra prints are available. If no negative existed for an extra print, two copies of the print, if available, were retained in the loose print file. The quality of the photography and developing process varies from county to county resulting in clear sharp images for some counties and badly faded ones for others. The photographs are divided into two categories. The first category, contained in Volume I only, consists of aerial views taken for the State Aviation Dept.

One of the activities used to accomplish this function is the administering of executive decisions and actions. This series consists of correspondence, reports, telegrams, agendas, newspaper clippings, and various publications regarding colleges, universities, reform schools, state hospitals, and other institutions funded by the state of Alabama.  Most of the routine correspondence was handled by O.H. Finney, Jr., Governor James E. Folsom's secretary. The majority of the files provide information on the colleges and universities in the state.  In addition to the two largest institutions, the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Alabama Polytechnic Institute in Auburn, the state maintained Alabama College in Montevallo; A &amp; M Institute for Negroes in Huntsville; Tuskegee Institute; and the State Teacher Colleges at Florence, Jacksonville, Livingston, Montgomery, and Troy. These records continue to document the establishment of a four-year medical school in Birmingham.  Many of the files were generated during the administration of Governor Chauncey Sparks.  The files contain correspondence, reports, and minutes of the Building Commission for the Four-Year Medical School. During the administrations of both Governor Sparks and Folsom committees were established to investigate conditions at various state institutions.  In 1946 a legislative committee issued reports on conditions at the state prisons, the Alabama Training School for Girls, the state mental health institutions, and the Alabama State Reform School.  In 1948 and 1950, Folsom received reports from the Survey Committee for State Institutions.  The Alabama Training School for Girls in Birmingham was publicly criticized for mistreatment of the girls in the custody of the institution.  A public hearing was held in 1949 March to address the charges.  Folsom's files contain correspondence, depositions, transcripts, reports, and photographs regarding the investigation and hearing. This series also documents the veterans on-the-job training program that was coordinated by the Department of Education.

                "abstract": "The Governor is the chief executive of the state whose function is to administer the laws of the state.  One of the activities used to accomplish this function is the administering of executive decisions and actions. This series consists of correspondence, reports, telegrams, agendas, newspaper clippings, and various publications regarding colleges, universities, reform schools, state hospitals, and other institutions funded by the state of Alabama.  Most of the routine correspondence was handled by O.H. Finney, Jr., Governor James E. Folsom's secretary. The majority of the files provide information on the colleges and universities in the state.  In addition to the two largest institutions, the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Alabama Polytechnic Institute in Auburn, the state maintained Alabama College in Montevallo; A & M Institute for Negroes in Huntsville; Tuskegee Institute; and the State Teacher Colleges at Florence, Jacksonville, Livingston, Montgomery, and Troy. These records continue to document the establishment of a four-year medical school in Birmingham.  Many of the files were generated during the administration of Governor Chauncey Sparks.  The files contain correspondence, reports, and minutes of the Building Commission for the Four-Year Medical School. During the administrations of both Governor Sparks and Folsom committees were established to investigate conditions at various state institutions.  In 1946 a legislative committee issued reports on conditions at the state prisons, the Alabama Training School for Girls, the state mental health institutions, and the Alabama State Reform School.  In 1948 and 1950, Folsom received reports from the Survey Committee for State Institutions.  The Alabama Training School for Girls in Birmingham was publicly criticized for mistreatment of the girls in the custody of the institution.  A public hearing was held in 1949 March to address the charges.  Folsom's files contain correspondence, depositions, transcripts, reports, and photographs regarding the investigation and hearing. This series also documents the veterans on-the-job training program that was coordinated by the Department of Education.  This program was subjected to criticism also during the Folsom administration.  The Governor's files contain letters and petitions from veterans state-wide defending and praising the program. Other state institutions documented in this series include the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind, Alabama Boys Industrial School at East Lake, the Alabama Reform School for Negro Boys at Meigs, the Alabama School of Trades at Gadsden, and the Alabama Vocational School for Girls at Birmingham.

One of the activites used to accomplish this function is the administering of executive decisions and actions. This series consists of correspondence, reports, telegrams, agendas, newspaper clippings, and various publications regarding colleges, universities, reform schools, state hospitals, and other institutions funded by the state of Alabama.  Most of the routine correspondence was handled by Roland Mushat, Governor Frank Dixon's secretary. The majority of the files provide information on the colleges and universities in the state.  In addition to the two largest institutions, the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Alabama Polytechnic Institute in Auburn, the state maintained Alabama College in Montevallo; A ? Tuskegee Institute; and the state normal schools at Daphne, Florence, Jacksonville, Livingston, Montgomery, and Troy. Events of special note include the death of University of Alabama president Richard C. Foster in 1941 Nov.  Retired president George H. Denny, the University Chancellor, served as president of the school until Raymond R. Paty was installed in 1942 Aug.  Alabama College at Montevallo dedicated two new buildings, Julia Tutwiler Hall and B.B. Comer Hall, on 1940 Apr. 25.  The files also contain Six-Year Capital Improvement Program project reports on other repairs and improvements made at the Montevallo campus.  A bulletin entitled \"Alabama Women and Their Employers, 1938-1939\" by Dr. Minnie L. Steckel is also contained in the Alabama College files.  This bulletin was the third in a series published by the college in collaboration with the Alabama Federation of Business and Professional Women Clubs. The Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind records contain a brochure written by President J. S. Ganey on the history of the school.  In 1940 June, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved WPA projects for the school  Also in 1940, Governor Dixon requested a survey of the institute by Dr. Percival Hall, president of Gallaudet College.  This survey was released in the fall of 1940 and contains photographs as well as detailed narrative regarding needed improvements.  The files also contain photographs of Dixon with students at the institute. This series also contains reports and correspondence on the Alabama Insane Hospitals.  In addition to correspondence with W.D. Partlow, superintendent of the entire system, there is correspondence from patients at the hospitals and family members of patients.  There is also information on the Alabama Citizens' Committee to Serve in the Interest of the State Hospitals and Public Health, including correspondence from the organization's secretary, Hobson Owen Murfee. Other state institutions documented in this series include the Alabama Boys Industrial School at East Lake, the Alabama Reform School for Negro Boys at Mt. Meigs, the Alabama School of Trades at Gadsden, the Alabama Bocational School for Girls at Birmingham, and the Alabama Training School for Girls. <\/abstract>\n                  <name>\n                     <namePart>Unknown<\/namePart>\n                     <role>\n                        <roleTerm valueURI=\"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/relators\/rps\">Repository<\/roleTerm>\n                     <\/role>\n                  <\/name>\n               <\/mods>\n            <\/objectXMLWrap>",

One of the activities used to accomplish this function is the administering of executive decisions and actions. This series consists of correspondence, reports, telegrams, agendas, invoices, newspaper clippings, and various publications regarding colleges, universities, reform schools, hospitals, and other institutions funded by the state of Alabama. The majority of the files provide information on the colleges and universities in the state.  In addition to the two largest institutions, the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Alabama Polytechnic Institute in Auburn, the state maintained Alabama College in Montevallo; A ? the State Agricultural Schools; the State Normal Schools at Daphne, Florence, Jacksonville, Livingston, Montgomery, and Troy; and Tuskegee Institute. Events of special note include the resignation of Alabama College President O. C. Carmichael and the appointment of A. F. Harman as Carmichael's successor.  The University of Alabama also underwent a change of leadership.  President George H. Denny retired in 1937 and was replaced by Richard C. Foster.  The records also contain correspondence to the Governor regarding the 1938 Rose Bowl in which the University of Alabama football team was defeated by the University of Washington.  This file also contains a publicity publication for the film, Wells Fargo, that was autographed to Bibb Graves from Johnny Mack Brown (a former University of Alabama football player turned actor) expressing regret that Graves was unable to attend the Rose Bowl. The Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) also experienced a change in leadership during the Graves' administration.  Dr. Luther N. Duncan was elected president of the land-grant college by the Board of Trustees in 1935 Feb.  The files for API reveal that the school lobbied to be chosen as a site for the Regional Research Laboratory as designated in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938.  A detailed report compiled to promote the school as a suitable laboratory site is included in the records.  A booklet of photographs is also included among the Regional Research Laboratory promotional material.  These images of the school and the town of Auburn provide an excellent ca. 1938 pictorial history of the community. This series also contains reports and correspondence on the Alabama Insane Hospitals.  W. D. Partlow was superintendent of the entire system which included Partlow State School and Bryce Hospital in Tuscaloosa and Searcy Hospital in Mt. Vernon. Other state institutions documented in this series include the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind at Talladega, the Alabama Boys Industrial School at East Lake, the Alabama Reform School for Negro Boys, the Alabama Vocational School for Girls, the Southern Industrial Institute, and the Confederate Soldiers' Home at Mountain Creek.  The records in this series were created and maintained during Governor Graves' 1935 to 1939 term of office with the exception of the files on the Confederate Soldiers' Home.  The correspondence in this file begins in 1919 with Governor Thomas Kilby and continues through Graves' second administration. <\/abstract>\n                  <name>\n                     <namePart>Unknown<\/namePart>\n                     <role>\n                        <roleTerm valueURI=\"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/relators\/rps\">Repository<\/roleTerm>\n                     <\/role>\n                  <\/name>\n               <\/mods>\n            <\/objectXMLWrap>",

One of the activities used to accomplish this function is the administering of executive decisions and actions. This series consists of the administrative files of Governor Benjamin Meek Miller.  It contains correspondence, reports, photographs, pamphlets, publications, and telegrams.  The records consist of correspondence and other material regarding the activities of the numerous state departments and agencies.  Among the state agencies and organizations that reflect significant attention in the Governor's records are the Board of Administration and its subagency, the Convict Department; the Child Welfare Department; the Highway Department; the Public Service Commission; and the Tax Commission. Governor Miller's administrative files contain records regarding legislation and legislativ eissues, appointments, public relations activities, and state institutions that were later maintained in a separate filing system by his successors.  Among the issues documented in these files are education, taxation and the income tax amendment, social welfare programs, pensions, highways, coal miners strikes, cotton acreage control, the repeal of the 18th Amendment (ending prohibition), and litigation regarding the salaries of public officials. In addition, there is considerable documentation of the relief and recovery programs establishe din the state after the inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 March.  These programs were in response to the massive unemployment brought on by the Great Depression.  The records document the National Recovery Administration, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and the Alabama Relief Administration.  The files contain correspondence with Harry L. Hopkins, head of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and Jugh S. Johnson, the administrator of the National Recovery Administration.  There is also correspondence with Alabama Senatro John H. Bankhead.  This series also contains correspondence from Alabamians requesting jobs, money, or any type of assistance available. Miller's trip to Washington, D.C. to attend Roosevelt's inauguration is also documented in these records.  Some of the files reflect incidents or issues that began during the first administration of Governor Bibb Graves. <\/abstract>\n                  <name>\n                     <namePart>Unknown<\/namePart>\n                     <role>\n                        <roleTerm valueURI=\"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/relators\/rps\">Repository<\/roleTerm>\n                     <\/role>\n                  <\/name>\n               <\/mods>\n            <\/objectXMLWrap>",

This series consists of the administrative files of Governor Bibb Graves' first administration.  It contains appointments, applications, briefs, budget statements, contracts, correspondence, invitations, leaflets, lists, pamphlets, petitions, photographs, reports of various types, requisitions, speeches, and telegrams. The records consist of correspondence and other materials regarding the numerous state departments and agencies.  In particular the Convict Dept., the State Docks Dept., the Highway Dept., the Public Service Commission, the Tax Commission, the State Dept. of Education and the State Bridge Corporation are well represented.  There is also much information about schools and colleges in Alabama, especially Alabama Polytechnic Institute, the Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind, and the University of Alabama. Many annual reports are included as well.  There are also briefs and legal documents regarding Alabama Supreme Court decisions from 1924-1931.  They are filed alphabetically. In addition, there is considerable documentation regarding Graves' efforts to eliminate the convict lease system, to expand educational opportunities and the building of schools, to discuss pending legislation, and to build bridges and roads in the state.  There is also documentaion regarding the development of Muscle Shoals, the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, the 1929 flood that damaged Elba, Geneva, and surrounding areas, the openinging of the State Docks of Mobile, and J. Thomas Heflin's 1930 race for the US Senate, activities of the Ku Klux Klan, the Hoover inauguration, overall reform of the state prison system, and gubernatorial pardons and paroles.  There is also considerable information about The Olmstead Brothers' plan for the Capitol Complex.  Many routine replies, and some not so routine, were handled by Arthur Heustess.  Also, some routine correspondence was handled by gubernatorial secretaries John S. Tilly and Pitt Tyson Maner. <\/abstract>\n                  <name>\n                     <namePart>Unknown<\/namePart>\n                     <role>\n                        <roleTerm valueURI=\"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/relators\/rps\">Repository<\/roleTerm>\n                     <\/role>\n                  <\/name>\n               <\/mods>\n            <\/objectXMLWrap>",
