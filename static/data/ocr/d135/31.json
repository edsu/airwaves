Due to an error on our part, your name was never\nplaced on the Fact Sheet mailing list* I am therefore enclosing\nthe Fact Sheets which were printed from June to December, 1957.\nI assume you received those which were printed prior to June •\nIf this assumption is incorrect, please let me know and we will\nsee that you receive those Fact Sheets.\nI am also enclosing a mimeographed letter explaining our new\nFact Sheet printing and price. Because your name was not on\nour mailing list, you would not have received notice of this\nchange and therefore could not take advantage of continuing\nyour subscription at the old price of $2.50 rather than the new\nprice of $4.00. If you desire to continue subscribing during\n1958, we will let you have the Toumal for only $2.50.\nI am sorry for this error and hope you haven’t been inconvenienced\ntoo much. Please let us hear from you.\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Judith B. Gans\nSecretary\nEnclosures"
