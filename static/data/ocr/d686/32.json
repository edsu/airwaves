Russell Porter\nSpecial Associate\nSocial Science Foundation\nUniversity of Denver\nBeaver 10, Colorado\nBear Russ:\n1 was delighted to get your note of February 5, and to\nlearn of your ambitious plans. I h ve extreme doubts, however,\nthat you will be able to proceed with the leasing of FM facilities*\nbecause the Commission has looked with disdain on any previous\napplications of this sort. Furthermore, the clearances of dramatic\nrights for the SA1B network has been based on presentation over\nn^ commercial stations* While it is possible that future elearanoes\nmight include an arrangement such as yours, all of the present pro-\ngrams would not be available to you*\n^hy not consider the possibility of having your own FM sta¬\ntion, even if you start with ten watts* She eost of a ten watt sta¬\ntion should not exceed $3600 to $4000* I would be delighted to have\nFrank Gunther of REL send you the details* MAES will be glad to\nprovide engineering and legal counsel, and even make the application\nup for you. If you had the money, you could be on the air within\nfour to five weeks* Oils could always be expanded to increase your\neffective radiated power, whenever funds became available. In that\nevent, you would have available to you between five ami ten hours\na week of programming from the SAEB network*\nIf there is any way in which you think any of us can be\nof help to you, you know you need only call out.\nWith all best wishes, I am\nCordially yours.\nSeymour H.
