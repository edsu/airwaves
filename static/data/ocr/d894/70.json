  "text": "Urbana, Illinois\nDear Franks\nI aw filing for an NA22J appearance before the FCC in the *Mayflower** hear¬\nings. I have written to several people, including Novik and the boys at\ntfiseonsln who urged participation in the hearings, about this matter. I\nalso wrote to tfilbur Schramm to suggest any general sources of information\nand aid on this matter and raised, incidentally, a question which you\nmight be better able to answer? that is, can Fred Siebert participate\nor would his relationship with the HAB in anyway prevent this?\nSecondly and most important, what is your own thinking on what could be\nsaid in this matter? The FCC, as you know, has invited our participation.\nX think it is a proposition on which something should be said honestly\nand fairly. Certainly, the issue is tremendouply complex and any cate¬\ngorical conclusions are difficult to make. % own feeling is that\noperators of radio stations do have a unique and speoial responsibility.\nAt the same time, I want nothing done to destroy the freedom of speech.\nI think we both recognize that the NAB has a rather specious and self-\ninterested point of view and their apparent objective is not their real\none*in this case. At the same time, I think it would be inept and ridic¬\nulous for us to directly fight them*\nThanks for forwarding all the material, Frank. I appreciate it*\nI am just in the throes of completing a suggested organization and\noperation plan for all districts in NA1B, This together with the News-\nLetter has taken most of my time to date. I want shortly to run it across\nin front of all of you and I will especially appreciate* from you, as one\nof the \"hard-headed\" members of the organization, very frank reactions.\nPlease send any news items that occur to you. I don*t want this bulletin\nto consist exclusively of \"clips*, dreams, and paragraphs pulled out of\nletters with a pair of pliers.\nSincerely,\nR. B. Hull\nPresident\nRBKirmm"
