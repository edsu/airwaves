His previous series for the Network ran for over a year, and\nthe response to this new series has been good. We may point out that\nthough this quarter offers the last thirteen of twenty-six programs in\nthe series, these thirteen programs may be used independently of the\nfirst thirteen.\nThis series is made possible through a grant in aid from the Educational\nTelevision and Radio Center in cooperation with the University of Chicago\nwhere the programs are being edited. Since editing of these thirteen\nprograms is now in progress, we are unable to give specific information\nconcerning the interviewees ard the subject of their conversations with\nMr. Mayer. When this information is in our hands we will rush it to all\nstations."
