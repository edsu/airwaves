A larger installation, used only as a lab,\nis best served by an inclined floor with all booths facing forward and\nfitted with a sliding front panel. This provides a view of the instructor,\nthe projection screen, etc. The audio materials can profitably be inter¬\nspersed with visuals and sometimes synchronized with them, as with sound\nfilms or controlled-speed reading and hearing.\nThe use and the costs of any lab can be shared by several departments,\nmost commonly speech, music, drama, even stenography, along with the language\ndepartment* Maintenance should be frequent and preventive rather than a\nmatter of repairing breakdowns* Equipment should be of sturdy high quality\nbut not \"hi-fi\" unless music is involved* Cheap home recorders are better\nthan none but will break down frequently if heavy duty is imposed on them."
