Birmingham\nwill definitely be on the air by raid-fall. A second\nmajor station in the state will go on the air in 1954Â»\nbut It is improbable that it will be in Montgomery so I\nthink that we had better strike that out for the sake\nof accuracy.\nA review of the report confirms ray original impression\nthat we have turned out a very significant document.\nI hope your plans for the European trip are shaping\nup nicely.\nMy regards to the family.\nSincerely,\nGraydon Ausraus\nPresident\nGA/jeh"
