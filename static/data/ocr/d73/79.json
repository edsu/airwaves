In this, the educational broadcasters\nhave a beckoning opportunity for leadership.\nFor it is my steadfast conviction that television\noffers a practical and immediate means for the\ngreatest forward stride in education since the\ninvention of the printing press and the text¬\nbook.\nII. THE PROBLEM IN EDUCATION\nThe dimensions of the current problem in\neducation are clearly evident even to the lay¬\nman.\nThey are reflected almost daily in grim\nheadlines about the explosive increase in\nschool population, the serious shortages of\nteachers and facilities, and the steady rise in\nthe cost of education. They are revealed, too,\nin sobering statistics which show that one out\nof three high school graduates, who finishes in\nthe top quarter of his class, does not go on to\ncollege because of a lack of funds. And in\nother statistics which show that fully 50 per\ncent of all college graduates over the next ten\nyears could well be used in the teaching ranks.\nAgainst this background, the inadequacy of\nour teaching methods is becoming painfully\napparent. In schools, generally, the chief reli¬\nance is still on the teacher, the textbook, and\nthe blackboard, as it has been for generations,\nto the exclusion of far-reaching innovations\nthat have been developed in recent years.\nAnd this brings me to my main thesis. As a\nformer science teacher whose interest in the\neducational process has deepened with the\nyears, I believe there is still another educa¬\ntional problem of even greater dimensions"
