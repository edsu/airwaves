I’ve spoken to Bill Harley about this on several occasions during\nthe past few months and he agreed that it would be helpful. I hope it can be\nscheduled for the Milwaukee conclave.\nWe don't have minutes of our last national HI committee meeting. The committee\nmember designated to take the minutes has never submitted them to me—Actually,\nnothing constructive was developed and we spent most of the time finalizing the\nFR KITS. You really didn't miss muchI\nWe’re anxious to hear from you concerning our current project: the speakers’\ndirectories.\nAll the best.\nMarion Corwell\nAssociate Director\nMC/hjk"
