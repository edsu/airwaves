However, from my reports\nthat I get upon the votes it does not seem that I am\ngetting very many. Mix and Slack seem to be very loyal\nand efficient in sending in their votes. Just in case\nyou need some more, I would cast my vote \"no\" for The\nPlayroom. I did not find the tape interesting or well\nproduced. I tried it upon my grandchildren and they\nwouldn’t listen to it. I cast my vote \"yes\" for The\nFourth R. It is well produced, it is an interesting\nshow, but I don’t think it is highly educational and\nprobably has less appeal for the adult audience than\nfor a youthful audience.\nI have sample tapes for Britain Today, The\nChild Beyond, Patterns of Thought, and a tape on the\nUnited States college education. Do you wish me to\nsubmit votes for these programs in order to break and\nspeed up acceptance or rejection?\nCordially yours.\nWa I do Abbot\nDirector of Broadcasting\nte>\nD S CUL <sDj2UA- ^\nWA/et\n^alhu. vuX ^\nCU/cdL ■C'K- \\JVL o\nuv^Si 't-o/xCj * oU ensj 4^- Dv cc£m cCcoa _ \"T ov\naJU <Jk. jJL aX Oy <z^O° CL Sl\nCU&' late* <Ud~ X .\nvuo."
