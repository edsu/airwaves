This would be particularly interesting in the\ncase of experimental works when the original recording of a trend or\ntendency could be examined after a period of years to see how it had\ndeveloped with the passage of time.\nEven though the recordings so assembled would not in the\nnormal way be broadcast but merely available for inspection on the\nspot or borrowing for such purposes, there would still arise a copy¬\nright problem which would have to be solved individually in each case\nbut Mr. Malatini did not think that this would prove to be unduly\ndifficult.\nThere was some discussion as to where this collection should\nbe held and catalogued and, at the suggestion of the Secretary of the\nmeeting, the experts agreed to recommend to the Committee that :\nthe Central Documentation Bureau operated by the RTB/BRT\nin Brussels on behalf of EBU member organizations be\nasked to consider whether it could undertake the initial\ncollection and subsequent annual acquisition of recordings\nof unusual interest in the field of radio drama. On the\nassumption that the Brussels Documentation Bureau (or\nsome other centre) could do this, interested organizations\nshould be invited to send initial recordings of 12 radio\ndramas as representative of the best of their output up\nto and including the year 1970« This would form the basis\nof the archive to which members would be invited to\ncontribute up to six further recordings each year. Each\nrecording should be accompanied by its script in the\noriginal language and a brief synopsis in either English\nor French together with its producing organization^\nwritten reason for proposing its inclusion in the archive.\nCopyright should be so cleared that other organizations\nmight borrow recordings from the archive for study but\nnot for broadcast purposes."
