How¬\never, such a memorandum is now underway and will be forwarded to\nyou shortly*\nI hope you have had time to listen to some of the records in the\ntwo albums I left for you. If you have not yet had the opportunity\nto hear any of them, I suggest particularly “The living Declaration,**\nfrom the leffersonian Heritage and “The Music and the Dream“ from\nPeople Under Communism.\nMay I say what a pleasure it was for Mr* Hurlbert and myself\nto meet with you recently and thank you again for your courtesy\nand consideration in listening to us.\nSincerely yours,\nWilliam G * Harley\nWGH/mlg"
