All the way\ndown, there were crowds of people throwing white handkerchiefs\nunder her feet for her to walk on. Well, sir, she announced again\nshe was going to walk on the water clear across that lake; and I8m\ntold that she actually got herself ankle-deep into the water*\nThen she suddenly stopped, and addressing the multitude, â€œ0 ye\npeople,K says Jemima, 8do ye have faith that I can pass over.1*\nAll the multitude assures her that they do have faith; all the\nfaith in the world* 11 In that case,3 says Jemima, aif ye truly\nbelieve in my powers, there is no need for me to display them.H\nand back she goes to the carriage, and off she goes home* I see\nthey5re coming out of church now* You *11 have to exouse me now;\nI have to meet my wife. Hope I8ve been Of some assistance to you*\nGood bye gentlemen!\nGoodbye, sir!"
