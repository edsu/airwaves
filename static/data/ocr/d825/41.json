  "text": "One of the most serious problems facing educators when\nthey begin using educational broadcasts in their classrooms\nIs developing utilization “know-how.\" For years educators\nhave recognized the key role the classroom teacher plays in\nthe proper use of educational broadcasts,, To be effective,\nlessons received by radio and television must be integrated\ninto the total learning process underway in the classroom.\nOnly the individual classroom teacher can assess and direct\nthis Integration,, In varying degrees this Is true of all\ntypes of broadcasts whether they are called, “enrichment,\nsupplemental or direct teaching„“\nRecognizing this problem and doing something about It\nare two different things. First, “uti1ization“ as such does\nnot exist, not being a subject like fractions or American\nhistory to be studied and mastered. Utilization Is an\nIllusive art which is unique to each person. It has to be\na part of each teacher's way of doing things. Specific\nutilization procedures used with broadcast lessons are\nimportant only in that they increase the lessons effective¬\nness In the classroom. Utilization for utilizations sake is\nunimportant.\nFrom discussions with people active in the educational\nbroadcasting field it is apparent that, while no one pattern\nof utilization can be taught, specific techniques are used\nby teachers and these can be transmitted through observation."
