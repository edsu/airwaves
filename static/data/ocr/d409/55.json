A problem of transportation of\nmaterials and equipment to the places they are used becomes troublesome, and\nthe accessibility of the center to faculty and students is limited. To be\nmost efficient and useful, the center should be so located as to be readily\naccessible to all parts of the campus.\nAltho there are definite advantages in so doing, on some campuses it is\nimpossible to house all aspects of the audio-visual center or the communica¬\ntion arts under one roof. Probably the most frequent division is between the\nproduction services and the circulation or distribution activities. Any de¬\ngree of dispersion, however, complicates administration and tends to make use\nof services more difficult and less effective.\nExperience indicates that it is advisable if at all possible to consoli¬\ndate all center operations and activities on the first floor level. This\nencourages browsing by faculty and staff and facilitates shipping and receiv¬\ning of equipment and materials."
