This, together\nwith the rest of our requests, will then be discussed informally\nwith John Weiss of the Ford Foundation before the proposals\nare formally made. From this discussion may come certain\nreactions and ideas which could be fed back into our final and\nformal request. # # #\nSo, there is a report of action to date. Your reactions\nand suggestions are, of course, welcome now as always.\nIn this connection, I might say that within a few weeks\nI hope to hold a meeting in Washington of a small steering\ncommittee to set up the high level Washington conference we\ndiscussed in Chicago. I discussed the matter at some length\nwith Gertrude Broderick when I was in Washington on December\n20th, and a start was made. (Schenkkan has been provided\nwith an ad hoc committee to advise him on the Magnuson Bill,\nand will probably have dates set up with representatives of\nSenator Magnuson before you receive this memorandum.)\nBPtds\nt"
