  "text": "The Model for A National Public Radio System, drafted by\nHartford N. Gunn, Jr., following the November 8, 1968 planning\nmeeting at WNYC in New York, establishes goals that are attainÂ¬\nable and desirable for public radio.\nBefore any model is activated, there should be reaction\nto the proposal which evolved from the planning session.\nThis is one reaction coupled with a proposed alternative.\n(Referral to the initial document will be of assistance as this\npaper is studied.)\nI. Status of Radio Today.\nThe evaluation of the status of radio today is, perhaps, too\nharsh. It is realistic. Our principal concern must be what\nradio can be and what it can do. The network structure\nshould be built on a foundation of existing stations.\nII. The Basic System.\nThe suggestion that \"listeners must be able to identify this\nsort of programming (public radio) in a flash\" is desirable\nbut impractical. We would agree with the concept that the\nprogramming must have a character and, if possible, a \"sound\"."
