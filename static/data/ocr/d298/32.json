Granted that clear channel stations do pro¬\nvide some general form of program service to distant areas, it is submitted\nthat the public interest would better be served by permitting an NAEB station\nto serve its own area with its unique type of service at the cost of depriving\nsome clear channel station of a comparatively small number of listeners in\ndirtant areas of a general type of program service, particularly when such\nlisteners have available to them programs from other stations closer to them*"
