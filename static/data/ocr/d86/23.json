Enactment of this legislation would open the way to the\nfull use of the8e. frequencies now reserved in this State for education, and\nprovide broadly educational television service for the communities not now\nserved. In addition, it would permit school districts and State Colleges to\ntake advantage of two new technical developments in televisions (1) low\npower transmitters which can, at minimal expense, provide an instructional\ntelevision service throughout a given school district or college campus;\nand (2) low power translator television stations which can automatically\nreceive and retransmit the signals of such established stations as KQED\nand KVIE, extending their instructional services into regions not now\nreached by their primary signals. A desire to employ both of these services\nexists in a large number of school districts and colleges in California today.\n2. County school superintendents shall be permitted to use television as an\nadditional tool in the more effective and economical performance of their\nnormal functions, using available public funds for such purposes.\na. In-Service training of teachers in new and improved techniques; introÂ¬\nduction of new text and study materials; teacher's institutes.\nb. Special education programs including speech therapy for children and\nparents; teaching the physically handicapped, the gifted child, the\nhome bound.\nc. Special subject teachers in such subjects as foreign languages and\nscience for districts where such teaching skills are not available.\nd. Distribution of films and other audio-visual aids.\nThe above services, among others, are expensive and frequently cumbersome.\nThe amount of travel by teachers and administrators would be reduced, as well"
