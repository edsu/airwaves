Each method required\ndifferent planning.\n(Note: The idea for this manner of pre¬\nsentation is to start with the known.\nTeachers are familiar with those methods.\nThey feel comfortable thus far.)\nAH these methods are used on television\nlessons. All these methods lend them¬\nselves to television introduction and\nfollow-through.\nThere is more to beginning the use of a\ntelevision lesson than adjusting the\nblinds and turning on the set. Did you\nacquaint yourself with the lesson plan\nsent out by the television teacher.\n(Scene of teacher at desk studying\nlesson plan, making notes.)\nSuppose your lesson plans told you that\nthe television lesson was to demonstrate\nthe steps in weather prediction. What\ncould you do as an introduction.\nLets look at a few minutes of such a\nlesson; and you decide what you could\nhave done.\n(Scene - television teacher in\ndemonstration.)\nWhat could you have done? (Possibly,\nthrow up cards on a magnetic bocid.)\nYou could have raised the question of\nhow students get weather reports, dis¬\ncussed today's weather, etc."
