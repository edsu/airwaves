Becker\nApril 16, 1958\nThe best we*ve been able to do on expenses in Columbus for called committee\nmeetingsâ€”in view of near-absence of funds, is to pay for hotel and meals\nfor one day, if members come a day early or stay a day late. We can*t\neven pay expenses for Board members in general. I*m very sorry, I wish\nwe had adequate funds, I know of nothing closer to my heart than research-\nas I think you know.\nOur best. And good luck on your study tour. I*m glad Burt has asked you\nto stay on. Tyler tells me he*s asked Irving Merrill to pinch-hit for\nyou at the IERT.\nSincerely,\nHarry J.
