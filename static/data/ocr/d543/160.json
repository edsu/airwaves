Arthur Hungerford, Jr.\n19 Orchard Ridge Road\nChappaqua, New York\nDear Art:\nSince what George promised (or announced) was a \"grant** to the NAEB\nto publish this, I was a bit worried when he was given the copy.\nIf you can get it back, we'll publish ourselves (either with or without\ngrant). If you can't get it into your hands right away, we might as\nwell charge it off to \"experience\" or \"education.\"\nWe've become used to this sort of thing the last few years with Siegel\nin international relations, BFA getting things which were offered to the\nNAEB, etc. With time, we perhaps won't need to explain Harley's deciÂ¬\nsion in international relations.\nSincerely\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nhjs:rs\nB1 CC: i/Mr. William G. Harley\nMr. Jack McBride"
