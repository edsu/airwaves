Hill\nCC: John Holt\nHaving observed the duplicator operation anvl main¬\ntenance situation for the past two months, I feel that\nI should take over their maintenance from WILL. Ob¬\nviously, when I am away they will have to take care of\nemergencies, however, I feel that if one person takes\ncare of the machines, it will be much better than to\nhave constantly changing maintenance personnel, I can\nalso give them a daily check since I am on hand and this\nwill also help to prevent troubles, I feel too, that\nI will have more of a personal interest in their opera¬\ntion and that by close attention to them at regular in¬\ntervals, the overall operation will be improved.\nSince August 1, vacations at WILL have almost neces¬\nsitated ray taking over their maintenance, McGee has\nbeen at Allerton most of the time, and ray personal feel¬\ning is that Colaw tolerates them as a necessary evil.\nIf we could break McGee loose from his WILL duties for\na few hours, he and I could move all the recording heads\nback to their normal positions, make a frequency and\ndistortion run and Ifd be off to a fresh start.\nOn August 19 and 20, I came back in the evenings\nand gave both machines a good cleaning which they needed\nbadly, I checked all tubes on the latter date, I also\ncleaned up the floor around the machines which was covered\nwith pieces of adhesive tape used to stick the ends of\nthe tape down. There were also cigarette butts on the\nfloor with the above litter and on the day following ray\ncleanup. Use of ash trays has since been recommended\nto personnel."
