The response of the CEPT, to which this\nquestion was put at the Karlstad meeting, in May 1970, was that the PTT\nAdministrations could not undertake to provide stereophonic international\njunctions unless the broadcasting organizations guaranteed sufficient\nutilisation to render them economically viable for the Administrations.\nThis was why the questionary on international circuits, mentioned above,\nreferred also to stereophonic circuits; it requested information about\nthe utilisation of international stereophonic circuits that each organiza¬\ntion would envisage if such circuits were available both now and in 1975\nand 1980."
