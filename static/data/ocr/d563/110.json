I have reserved a room for each of you at the\nMayflower.\nI told Dick that you might want to get together with him that\nevening for dinner. You might want to drop him a note telling\nhim when you plan to get here. He has no phone at his home in\nCanada. However, you can either write to him, or send him a\ntelegram (which he would get in two days) asking him to call you\nand he would go into town and call. His address is;\nRichard Bell\nc/o Slim Colberg\nRR #1\nCarling Bay\nNobel, Ontario, Canada\nRegards,\nHarold E. Hill\nHEH/mlm"
