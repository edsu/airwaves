To continue to push print as the primary approach\nis to continue to create an ever concentric circle of stone vails\nsurrounding the child.\nOutside of school the ghetto child thinks, uses his mind.\nInside the classroom he is being shut off from the world. Television '\nand radio can bring that world in. We must use the mass media not\nonly to provide motivation through visual and aural action--rather\nthan through non-meaningful (to that child) print symbols--but we\nmust use the mass media to provide a socializing situation for the\nchild, to make the real world a part of the classroom, to provide the\nproblems of the real world as the learning problem; the solutions\nlearned--or at least the understanding obtained--is what constitutes\neducation. Information regurgitated on examinations is not education.\nOne new hopeful approach to reaching the ghetto child is the\nrecently announced Children’s Television Workshop, with an anticipated\nbudget of $8 million provided by the government and foundations. Yet,\neven here the announced plans indicate that the approach will be to\nproduce programs (26 one-hour shows), of an information-education nature\ndesigned to provide what the children would have gotten in the class¬\nroom if classrooms were available.\nToo many TV projects have already concentrated on the information-\neducation approach, when what is first needed by the inner-city child\nis motivation, self-understanding, and ego-building identification\nwith one’s background and immediate self."
