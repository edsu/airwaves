Hill\nAdministrative Vice President, NAEB\n13U6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Harold:\nWe are working like mad in developing something on the promotion\nslides, and as soon as possible, I will get to you a figure regard¬\ning the cost of these that you can present before the Board. I\nwill also include some tentative designs as you requested. I hope\nyou will apoligize to the Board for the fact that this matter had\nto be developed so quickly, since I am sure that we could have done\na much better job if we had had a little more time at our disposal.\nYou have a copy of a letter Betty wrote me under date of October 2,\n1961, regarding the quotation on the SPEAKER’S GUIDES. I am\nwondering if you would also attempt to secure the approval of the\nBoard for this expenditure in advance of our meeting. I am most\ninterested in getting these GUIDES out because of the many pur¬\nposes that they could serve. I talked the matter over in consid¬\nerable detail with Marion Corwell when she was in Indianapolis last\nweek, and she is equally enthusiastic about this proposition.\nParenthetically, Marion would be an excellent person to head this\ncommittee next year — the best, in fact, that I know of.\nElmer G.
