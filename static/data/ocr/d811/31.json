Kellogg Foundation\nfor a Project in\nTeacher Training and Professional Standards Development\nfrom the\nNational Association of Educational Broadcaster^\nIntroductory Statement\nThis is a special request to the to . X, Kellogg Foundation for a\nlimlted~tem, intensive project in two related areas:\n1} Teacher-training in the most effective understandings and uses\nof television and radio as educational instruments. This will\ninvolve the close cooperation of several teacher-training insti¬\ntutions of the United States, and will cover both production and\nutilization aspects of these media.\nIt will involve bringing together the skills of communications\nand content area experts with those of experts in teaching pro¬\ncedure and educational philosophy. The end-product of such a\nproject will be sound courses and curricula in this area, eventu¬\nally in all or nearly all of the schools of education and teachers\ncolleges of the nation. This need is of great urgency in view of\nthe many educationally irresponsible uses being urged (which\nwould in many cases only make education cheaper rather than\nbetter and richer) and the trial and error procedures which now so\nlargely prevail as definitions of the educational roles of television"
