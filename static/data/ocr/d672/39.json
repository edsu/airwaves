B.\nChamberlain puts it: \"The only way for many AM\nstations to increase service area in the future will be\nthrough the use of directional arrays. There may\ncome a day when you desperately need those extra\nacres for a directional antenna system.”\n4. Marshy or over-water sites give increased\nradiation efficiency for AM stations, but\ngenerally make the building more expensive\nThe improved propagation characteristics of an\nAM installation on marshy ground or over water are\nattractive, but you should have competent estimates\nof the cost of construction in hand before you can\nbe sure that such a site will \"pay off.” Building on\nmarshy ground often involves very expensive under¬\npinning. Building over water will also require spe¬\ncial construction methods.\nThe ideal site from this point of view is one on\nwhich the transmitter building can be put up on a\nwaterfront plot by conventional methods, with a\nshort transmission run to the tower system in an\nadjoining sheltered body of water. The photograph\nbelow of Station KRE, Berkeley, California, shows\nan unusually fine site of this kind.\n5. The mid-city building as a\ntransmitter site\nThe excellent coverage and operating conven¬\nience of FM installations in tall city buildings must\nbe weighed against the following:\nAre there any zoning restrictions or building or-\nAerial view of 250 watt AM Station KRE, Berkeley, California, with combined transmitter-studio building, shows a site with many advantages.\nTransmitter is on edge of community, with easy access by main highway. Sheltered body of water provides excellent grounding conditions."
