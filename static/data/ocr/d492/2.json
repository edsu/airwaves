Even though we may\nNOT KNOW HIM WELL, WE READ ABOUT HIM, HEAR ABOUT HIM,\nTELL STORIES ABOUT HIM. GENERALLY SPEAKING, WE SEEM\nTO HAVE CONSIDERABLE CURIOSITY ABOUT HIM. AND, THE\nRESULTING COMBINATION OF IGNORANCE AND CURIOSITY, IS\nLIKELY TO GIVE RISE TO MYTH, LEGEND, AND PHANTASY.\nThe Negro is the various man. There exist very differ¬\ning IMAGES OF HIM. To THE SO-CALLED LIBERAL OF THE\nSouth as well as the North, he may appear as the un¬\nfortunate MEMBER OF AN OPPRESSED GROUP.
