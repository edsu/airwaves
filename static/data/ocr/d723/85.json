C.\nDear Mr. Hiten:\nWe are sanding you under separate cover several items which I\nbelieve will assist you. One of the items is a list of other\nmaterials which are also available. I would call your attention\nparticularly to items R3 (The Administrative Problems of the\n10-Watt Educational FM Station), and W-15 (Proceedings of the\n1956 NAEB Radio Engineering Seminar). Unfortunately, we must\ncharge $1.00 for each of^fefc^items and they, therefore, will\nnot be sent unless you order or request them.\nI hope these various materials are of interest and assistance\nto you.\nSincerely,\nHJS/mfb\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
