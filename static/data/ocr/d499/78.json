  "text": "Sir Charles Moses\nSeptember 23, 1965\nPage 2\nThough we are interested in helping to promote the development of the ABU and\nto be associated with its operations, it does not seem quite appropriate to us for a\nnon-commercial organization, and an Associate at that, to pay so much more than\nsome of the full-fledged members of the Union who, as you say, are only paying\n$100. per year. It would seem to us that it would be more equitable, considering\nthe special nature of our organization, to base assessment upon our Association\nbudget, rather than on the combined budgets of all our members. Our “members,**\nof course, are actually educational institutions; colleges, universities, and\nschool systems, whose primary responsibility and interest is in operating total\neducational systems of which the radio and/or television station is only a\nmodest part; hence, their interest in and contribution to the NAEB is rather marginal.\nI quite understand the difficulty of writing rules and regulations which will apply\nequitably to all the varied circumstances which obtain, but I assume, as I think you\nintend, that the main thing is to get the enterprise launched and leave details regard¬\ning special cases to be dealt with later when there is time to make a thorough\nassessment.\nCongratulations on the progress you have made to date in organizing the ABU. You\nare certainly to be heartily commended.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHimab"
