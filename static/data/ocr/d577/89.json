At the same time, persons who had previously\nbelonged to the NAEB and had been classified as Affiliate members were\ntransferred into the new Individual category, resulting in a decrease in\nthe number of Affiliate members. Only an approximate figure can be given\nlor the number of Individual members as of June 30, 1957 because tran¬\nsition from AERT status to NAEB status had not been completed.\n5\nThese two new categories of membership - Industrial Associate and Sus¬\ntaining member - were added within the past year. No concentrated\neffort has yet been made to secure new members in these categories.\nAs of February 1959 there are three Industrial Associates."
