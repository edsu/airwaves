Seay, Director\nDivision of Education\nJ^^KaliaggF-ounda\n^250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Dr. Seay:\nAnother year of intense activity for the NAEB has drawn to a close,\nand I want to take this opportunity to thank you and the Kellogg Foundation\nfor the very significant support that you have given our Association, not\nonly during the past year, but during the past ten years.\nAs soon as we are able to get the necessary fiscal details from the\nUniversity of Illinois* business office, we will forward to you a detailed\nfinancial statement for the fiscal year, July 1,1960-June 30,1961, together\nwith a written report of our year’s activities.\nThis past year has seen a new NAEB office opened in Washington, and\nwe feel that our location in the Nation’s Capital has enabled us to expand\ngreatly our service to educational broadcasting. We have made some strides\ntoward more complete self-support and are working on other possibilities.\nWe are looking forward to another year of cooperation with you and the\nK. Kellogg Foundation, and I assure you that even though the Kellogg\ngrant to NAEB terminates on June 30, 1962, we will still want to work\nclosely with you in our mutual efforts to further educational broadcasting.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G, Harley\nWGH.-kfm\nP. S. The next time you come to Washington, why not plan to drop up\nand see us in our new location. Harold and I would be pleased\nto fill you in on current developments."
