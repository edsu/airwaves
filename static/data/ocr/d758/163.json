Dr. Colby Lewis, met with your\ncommittee chairman and I to talk about the Journal. we discussed, among other\nthings, the availability of a series of articles ©a \"personalities\" in the field\nof educational broadcasting and also articles of a historical nature. These\nhave both been suggested from time to fcima by various readers as areas of in¬\nterest for the Journal.\nWe would like your help in several ways:\n1. Names of such \"personalities\" who would be good topics for articles-®\nand also suggestions for authors.\n2. Your thoughts (pro or con) on such a series, with attention to some of\nthe following, raised by Colby: Are we saluting our senior citizens at\na time whan they are safely beyond the unfocused struggle of everyday\noperations? Or am we singling oiit those who are still in there fighting?\nHow \"colorful\" must they be? Do we need to approve or disapprove their\nefforts? Do we try to \"explain\" these people? Do we simply designate\nsomeone close and presumably respectful and sympathetic to write them\nup? Or do we collect the opinions of several persons who have interacted\nwith them and put these opinions together at the rewrite desk?\n3. Suggestions of important nillastones in the development of educational\nbroadcasting that might make good \"historical\" articles--with suggestions\nof surviving participants who might write about the evoivemeat of such\n* milestones.\nWe would appreciate your help.\nThanks,\n(Mrs#) „ ozis\nPublications Editor\ncc: Dr. Colby Lewis"
