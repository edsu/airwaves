C.\np0ear Bills\nI want you to know that the statement you prepared on the\nAFTRA problem in New York is the only really intelligent\ncomment I have seen on the matter,\nI was quite disappointed in the NEA statement — it was\nentirely self-serving, trying to make sure that they\nretained jurisdiction over the teachers, and not let it\nget away to a union,\nI didnjt think Jack White’s comments were very well put,\nand showed a great lack of understanding of the union\nproblem, I have been really fearful that the naive boys\nin New York are going to get us into a lot of trouble.\nThanks for preparing such a fine statement.\nLoren B, Stone\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nSEP 24 1962\nPM\nTiMWWiMMW.\ni\nUniversity of Washington * Seattle Public Schools * King County Schools • Seattle University « Seattle Pacific College ® Seattle Public Library"
