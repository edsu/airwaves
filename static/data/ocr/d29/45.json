The global movement of inform¬\nation by technological means is by far the largest business\nin the world. Culture has become our business and has\nswallowed the business man as well as the educator.\nRabelais had a vision of printing as \"the world in\nPantagruelBs mouth”. It is a vision whose meaning is easy\nto discern now that rival mouths, and the maws of newer\nmedia await us. We can, as it were, take our pick among the\ngiants who will chomp upon us. Or, we can assume the role\nof Jack the Giant Killer and bring these vast projections\nor extensions of our own ingenuity under the control of our\nconscious purposes. The educator is now called to bring the\nalcheny of history within our management.\nIn business to-day, the budget item which exceeds both\nproduction and marketing costs is research. In a situation\nin which change is so fast as to approximate the condition\nof an explosion, big business has to outstrip change by\nanticipation and research. The goal of this research is to\nbe far ahead of change in order to control it."
