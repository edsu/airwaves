I think\nthat you have some provocative material here. The question now is,\nprovocative for what purpose? In other words, I think that there\nis now an urgent need to move on to the next step which we agreed\nupon at the meeting with the NAEB Research Committee last September\n(e.g., see Skornia's letter to Stone of October 9, 1959). This was\na specific statement of the behavioral goals of this course which\nmight provide ideas for the development of new kinds of instruments\nfor testing the outcomes. What should the youngsters who have had\nthis course do, or do differently, thap youngsters who have not had\nthe course?\nYou mentioned in one letter that Foshay said that he could provide\nthese objectives - or testable hypotheses - but he probably misunder¬\nstood you because the hypotheses he listed in his letter to me as\nthe sort of thing he had in mind were not hypotheses about the out¬\ncomes of the course but rather testable hypotheses concerning some\nof your basic ideas of the general effect of various media on child¬\nren - their effect on language, play activities, etc. It seems to\nme that this is a completely different series of studies. I think\nthat it would be worthwhile but you need to make up your mind what\nthe study is that you are going to do now."
