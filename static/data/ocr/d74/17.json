It was suggested that some of the determining factors\nshould be:\na. subject-areas now being neglected because lack\nof teachers or facilities;\nb. such areas which could be served if broadcast\ntelevision were available;\nc. expected increase in enrollment in next 10-15\nyears;\nd. further teacher or facility deficiency due to\nincreased enrollment and/or other factors. (teacher\nshortage, limitation of tax base, etc.)\ne. possibility of using broadcast television in\ncooperative effort to overcome such deficiencies;\nf. comparison of possibility of meeting local\nneeds by broadcast television with the experiences\nof other localities;\ng. relationship of local needs and facilities to\nstate and national resources of broadcast televiÂ¬\nsion facilities and materials (state networks,\nstate-assistance to localities, Federal assistance\nthrough state plans, etc.)\nIt was recommended that these criteria be expanded and clarified\nand furnished to the interviewers."
