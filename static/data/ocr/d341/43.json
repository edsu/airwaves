Skomia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nUrbsna, Illinois*\nDear Mr. Skomia;\nI tried to communicate with you when I was in the States a couple of\nweeks ago, but they told me that you were then in California*\nWhen I arrived in New York I found that our New York office had made\nsome contacts with people in the educational T.V. field. Among these were\nMr. George E. Probst end Mr. Seymour N. Siegel. Through them we developed\na working relationship with the Broadcasting Foundation of America, as the\noperating agency for the educational T.V. study in Venezuela. It appears\nnow that they will be able to send Mr. J. R. Winnie, of the University of\nIowa, to work in the project here. It is our hopÂ© that through this agency\nwe may be able to count on the assistance of the NAEB in any program that\nis developed in this country.\nI am sorry that I did not get to meet you, but perhaps this might be\ndona at some other time.\nVery truly yours,\n/s/ E* E.
