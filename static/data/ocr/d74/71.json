First of all, as I pointed out in my\npaper that appeared in the NAEB Journal on the Rating\nServices, even a group of educators involved in audience\nresearch might very well encounter the same problems in\nl) the uncontrollable problem in operational aspects in\nconducting television surveys and 2) the possible biased\nuses of such results by stations, advertising agencies,\nor whoever is footing the bill. However, I would be\nhappy to explore further the possibilities of Bill Harley's\nnotion, since any attempt toward \"clearing the air\" in the\ntelevision research audience area should be carefully con¬\nsidered.\nBy the way, our current Title VII Project is revealing some\nfascinating data. Our factor analysis particularly gave us\nsome unusual insights. As I promised, I will send you a\ncopy of the final report as soon as it is completed.\nKeep in touch (hope we can get together one of these days\nsoon).\nCordially yours,\nfJj. cfcs y\nRichard I. Evans\nProfessor of Psychology\nSamuel L. Becker, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\n111 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nRIE:v\ncc: Mr. Bill Harley"
