It\nis cur feeling that some such careful consideration would be indicated to insure\nacceptability and to help avoid the pitfalls which any such pioneer effort is likely\nto encounter, Such a meeting would of course precede any final decision by the\nFoundation on this proposal, and would also affect the final form in which it would\nbe submitted*\nIn view of our promise to have the present document before the Foundation\nby February 1, however, it was felt desirable to submit it in this preliminary draft\nby that time, for whatever discussion and further preparation* investigation* or\nexplanation may be indicated.\nOne of the other problems which might be explored in such a preliminary\nmeeting as is suggested is this: although all of the Deans of Education so far con¬\nsulted are sympathetic to such a proposal as this in general terras, we sometimes\nhave the uneasy feeling that many other deans and administrators are not aware of\npresent deficiencies in the communications systems of their own schools, or in\ntheir own concepts. Vve also feel that many are not aware of the tremendous dif¬\nference which is possible between traditional classroom instruction (at whatever\nlevel) and the new patterns of organization which the full potential of television\nand radio, properly understood and viewed, make possible.\nFor, humble as we are in the face of this problem, we feel that there is a\nmutual process of “education” needed, to which we, as well as they, can make\nsignificant contributions. Beginning, therefore, with a few such liberally-oriented\nDeans and other officers, we believe that the prospects of developing a workable\nunderstanding of both the need, and the manner of meeting it, will be greatly improved."
