Raymond DÂ« Cheydleur\nAssistant Director\nUniversity Broadcasting Services\nFlorida State University\nTallahassee, Florida\nDear Ray:\nA quick answer to your letter of the 14th* I gather\nthat the hiring of a director of research is dependent on\nsecuring Educational Foundation money. This is being\nrequested. It seems to me that any plans which we make\nfo* large scale research projects must be predicated\non the assumption that we will have a director, If we\ndo not, it seems to me futile to worry about big research\nprograms.\nBest wishes.\nCordially,\nSLB:mw\nSam L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevislon*Radio-Film"
