A serious thing to say\nabout the United States? the country that these Italians would agree has\nkept western Europe afloat economically since World War II; a country that\ncarries the greatest share of the financial burden for the Worth Atlantic\ntreaty organization, which Italy Joined four years ago; a country that\nsuffered well over a hundred thousand casualties In far-off Korea in\ndefense of the United nations.\nBut my Italian friend was completely sincere. He didn’t enjoy\ntelling me that he feared America was leading everyone down the road to a\nwar which could be avoided. But he was willing to argue the point — and\ndid, as a matter of fact, for several hours.\nAnd the fears he expressed and the criticisms he made about /American\nobjectives and motives and tactics — these things I have subsequently\nheard from a good many other sources; in every case, sources friendly to\nAmerica, sources who wanted to believe in America."
