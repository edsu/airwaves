Moody\nDepartment of Dramatic Arts and Speech\nUniversity Dramatic Center\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, Delaware\nDear Mr. Moodyt\nMe were very interested to learn of your move to the University of Delaware and\nare happy to send you information about a new membership and the fall convention.\nAs you probably know. Active and Associate memberships in the NAEB are institutional\nmember ships. Therefore, the University of Tampa will continue to be a member\nthrough this year, and subsequently of course if they continue to pay dues. If\nthe University of Delaware is presently producing regularly scheduled radio or\nTV programs over commercial stations, the University is eligible for Associate\nmembership. If programs are not produced on a regular basis. Affiliate membership\nmay be applied for. Of course, if your plans for a TV station progress to the\npoint where a CP is issued you would then be immediately eligible for Active\nmembership•\nFor your convenience I am enclosing Associate and Affiliate application forms\nand a few items to help you explain the NAEB to those with whom you are now\nworking. If you need anything else “persuasive\" just let me know. Of course,\nonce the University joins the Association we will do everything possible to help\nwith your plans for the new TV station.\nI am sending you a preliminary program and hotel reservation card for the\nAtlanta Convention. Me will be looking forward to seeing you there, and if you\nhave any other questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.\nSincerely,\nHarold E* Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHtdfc"
