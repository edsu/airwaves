IT we stand firm behind the engineering\ngroup — we may lose at least a part of the $4,000.\nIt’s hard to tell which is the most Important — the money or the\nrepudiation. My question to you is -- Is this Important enough to delay the\nAmpex'a purchase at this time, and throw the whole matter to the NAEB board\n— to another group of experts — or anyone else!\nIncidentally, Toogood does have a deal with Havdon Smith. He thinks\nery highly of him — and believes we would be very wise to buy the duplica¬\nting machine from him at $6,800, if that can be arranged. If not, he will\nsell us some parts, and show us how to construct a machine which, although not\ny|&n exact duplicate of his, will do the job. If not, he's back to his original\nidea, of eventually selling us one of his units. He wouldn't say when the\neventually would be, but I believe it would be at least 4 to 6 months.\nI'll be back in Urbane Tuesday and will call you.\n0\nJIM MILES"
