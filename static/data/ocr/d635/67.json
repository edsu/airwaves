SIEGEL\nDirector\nJOHN DE PROSPO\nExecutive Officer\nMarch 24, 1952\nMr. Graydon Ausmus\nWUOA, University of Alabama\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Graydon:\nI have your note of March 22nd concerning the NUEA. Dallas\nhas to be in Columbus anyway so I feel certain he would be\navailable if you need him.\nSince you are chairing the luncheon meeting, it would seem to\nme that you ought to introduce both Commissioner Walker and\nMr. Fletcher, whose letter of March 18th indicates that he will\nbe glad to talk to NAEB on Friday, April 18th. He, however, indi¬\ncates that he is still awating the letter of invitation from\nGraydon Ausmus which I told him vrould be forthcoming. He ends\nhis letter with the followings\nThere are many major problems which must be\nmet head-on with the hope that satisfactory\nsolutions can be found before the summer.\nI do not think it necessary for you to limit either one of the\nspeakers. What both say will be of sufficient newsworthy attention\nso that the crowd will hold up any future programming until the\nluncheon is over.\nIt would seem to me that with these headliners you should be able\nto charge sufficient for luncheon tickets to bring in even a greater\nprofit than you showed last year. I know that A1 Gaines will do a\nwonderful job of promoting the sale of tickets. It might not b« a\nbad idea to have him prepare a thousand invitations calling attention\nto the luncheon and mail those to the registrars at the Institute on\nThursday, April 17th.\nWith best wishes.\n.ially yours.\nans/h\nTTie Voice Of Tfie\nour N.
