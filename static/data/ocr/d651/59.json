The motion by the Board was not to enter into contracts for package\nproductions “for a two year period/* (This was warding in the motion adopted\nby the TV Board}* The Board motion was for “two experimental projects“ etc„\nwhich is quite a different thing, clearly limiting the extent of the activity and\nindicating Us modest experimental nature as the intent of the Board.\n2. hi the vote of the Board, which was not on the same motion as the one\napproved by the TV Board (since it changed the “two years“ to “two projects**\nand added the comments about not contemplating *‘setting up any regular system\nof distribution and production**), the majority of the TV Board voted |or the motion.\nIn effect, the majority of the TV members joined the other Board members in\napproving the altered motion. Consequently, you are misleading people to suggest\nthat the Board over-rode the TV Board. The vote was 14-2.\n3 . While it is true that the question of TV program production is primarily a\nmatter of interest to the TV stations, it is not without importance to the closed-\ncircuit TV ojerators, production centers, teachers and educational administrators,\nand all users of educational film and video materials, at home and abroad. I\nsuggest that this matter Is of broader relevance and greater significance than\njust the programming of ETV stations and that, therefore, it is appropriate for the\nentire Board representing the total membership to act upon this matter.\nCordially yours,\nWilliam G, Harley\nWGHipw\nCC; Mr.R.B.Hull\nMr, R. D, Hurlbert"
