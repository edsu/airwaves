I am associated with the\nUniversity of Illinois Medical Center Campus in Chicago.\nWe, at the University of Illinois, produced various radio\nand television programs that we would like to have submitted,\nif this is possible, to the award committee of the NAEB.\nWe feel that these programs are well done and deserve some\nrecognition. I was wondering if such awards are given for\npublic service radio and television programming, and if so,\nwhat would be the procedure in regard to submitting such\nmaterial.\nMy main function is in the area of public relations and radioÂ¬\ntelevision programming. I would like to offer my services\nto you and your committee.\nI feel strongly about my association with the NAEB and that\nit is an excellent and worthwhile organization. I would\nlike very much to continue directly, the good work that NAEB\nhas provided over these many years.\nAny help that I might be able to contribute, please feel free\nto contact me.\nSincerely\nAssistant Manager\nProducer-Director\n,JWR:ac"
