Riegel\nLee Memorial Journalism Foundation\nWashington and Lee University\nLexington, Virginia\nDear Mr* Riegel:\nReference is made to your letter of October 24 to Dr. Harry J* Skomia* I\nregret the delay in replying to your letter, but it arrived right after our\nreturn from our national convention and we are just now catching up on the\nbacklog that accumulated during our absence*\nUnfortunately, the facilities of our NAEB Network, which distributes about\neight hours of programming a week to educational stations by means of tape\nrecordings, are available only to Active members of our Association, and\nActive membership is restricted to educational institutions owning and\noperating their own stations. Therefore, I*m afraid that we would not be\nable to supply you with any programs from our Network* However, we do\nhave several outstanding series in album form and I am enclosing some des¬\ncriptive material about these in case you should be interested in purchasing\none or more of them.\nIt does seem to me that your institution might be interested in joining the\nNAEB as an Associate member, because, while you would not receive the pre-\ngrams of the Network, you would enjoy the other benefits of membership*\nAnnual dues for Associate members are 310 (to be raised to $25 in 1958 by\naction of the membership at our recent convention)* For this fee Associate\nmembers receive our monthly Newsletter, the NAEB Journal (formerly the AERT\nJournal); some of the various reports and surveys we publish periodically\n(I say \"some” because only Active members, who pay a higher fee, get all of our\nmaterials); services of our Placement service, television engineer, legal\ncounsel, management consultant, etc*; plus the normal day to day services,\ninformation, and advice that any national organization gives its members*"
