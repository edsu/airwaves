And hero wo were, under the circumstances I have\noutlined, asked to approve a series which would eat up between three and\nten times as much educational radio money as any series we had ever approved*\nIn this last regard, we are prepared to \"think big,\" but we feel we must\nalso tMtiir deliberately, systematically, and in full possession of all\nrelevant facts*\nI gather that it is the Center's feeling that, on contract matters, our\nCocsnittee should act in a \"reverse\" role from that it occupies on grants-\nin-aid; i.e., that it should \"rubber-stamp\" projects to which the Center\nhas already given close scrutiny. Perhaps this is sensible (although I,\nfor one, have hoped that all aspects of the total radio project would\ninvolve close co-operative deliberation)* In ary case, I hope you under¬\nstand why, in this instance, while the stamp is clearly there, it has\nbeen imprinted with reluctant hands.\nI am sorry to have written at such length and with what appears, on re¬\nreading, to be a somewhat injured air. We do appreciate some of the\ndifficulties under which the Center operates, and I am personally most\ngrateful for Ray Stanley's considerable pains in coming to Chicago and\ncommunicating with the Cceisnittee about the proposal under discussion*\nAnd I do hope you realize that this rather elaborate report upon our\nmisgivings is prompted only by the hope that, as the three year radio\nproject develops, it will be the kind of contribution to education\nthrough, broadcasting of which ell of us can feel proud*\nWhatever your reaction to all this, be assured that I am, as always.\nCordially yours.\nEdward Rosenheim, Jr.\nor: a\nCopied NAEB Headquarters 12/3/57dfc"
