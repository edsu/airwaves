  "text": "AUDIT REPORT\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nfor the year ended June 30, 19%h\nSCOPE OF AUDIT: All deposits and disbursements were checked in detail in verifying\nthe cash position at the start and close of the year. Test checks were made of\nchecks to invoices. The subsidiary ledger on news letter and membership dues was\nexamined and summarized in detail to verify income totals and total receivables at\nend of year.\nAll charges against restricted funds were examined in detail in verify¬\ning the balances remaining unexpended in those funds.\nGENERAL COMMENTS: All non-restricted funds and accounts are grouped at the top of\nthe accompanying financial statement, with a total all their own, since they rep¬\nresent the net worth as regards cash of the association at any time. As the report\nshows, this position improved greatly in the fiscal year, with the associations\nshare of the cash in bank increasing from $720.6ii to <jj>li,620.l5« The chief source\nof such income is the percentage of grants allowed the association for their adminis¬\ntration, and this varies from nothing to five or ten per cent, totaling $5,700.39 in\nthe fiscal year.\nThe receivables might well be examined with a view to writing off certain\nolder items not likely to be paid. The total receipts from the news letter seem\nhardly to justify the effort involved in billing and recording the items - consid¬\neration might be given to dropping the charge or putting it on a strictly cash basis.\nThe auditor wishes to acknowledge the complete cooperation and helpful¬\nness of the association treasurer, Mr. Frank E. Schooley, in the conduct of the\naudit.\n/s/ Paul McMichael\nPaul McMichaell\n1. Mr. McMichael is a graduate of the University of Illinois, has been business\nmanager of the Illini Publishing Company for about 20 years, and has frequently\naudited fraternal and university-associated organization accounts....FES\n12-1-51*"
