  "text": "Inasmuch as research for objective 3 will be a pioneering venture, we can expect\nto complete perhaps no more than two community case studies because of limitations\nin time, staff and budget.\nIf we were to project a research program into the period beyond the present\ngrant, I would especially endorse many additional studies of program impact upon\ncommunities.\nSince plans for the international series programs are indefinite at this time,\nnothing has been said about possible audience research dealing with them. If and\nwhen this series is set up, appropriate research will be done, of course.\nMerritt C. Ludwig\nresearch Director\nÂ¥01-TV"
