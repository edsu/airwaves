Suggest that members affected\ncontact Marcus Cohn direct®\nIn Haste\nHJSsdo\nExecutive Director\nlugust 26, 19 £3\nDear'. Harry*\nI have noted an article in the August l?th issue of BROADCASTING, page 60? which\nhas a very definite and serious iffplication for several of our member stations.\nThis article has to do with the change of FCG rules regarding sky wave inter¬\nference. It may require that some of us operate on reduced power for the ij hours\nafter sunrise and the lj hours before sunset. In our case, in December this\nwould mean reduced power before 9t3P am and after 3t30 pm. Some of our most\neffective programs would be effected and our listening area cut dosm very mater¬\nially.\nIn the clear channel hearings of 19U6 there were seven NAEB sta&ons which were\neffected and which took an active part in the hearing procedures. These are WOI,\nWOSU, WNAD, KUOM, WHA, WILL and WKAR. These same stations would come under the\nnew rulings®\nI feel that there should be some united action to protect our interests® Perhaps\nNASB has already started action® If not I suggest that the stations involved,\nat leqst, should be alerted and that the NAEB attorney should be asked to keep\nan ear to the situation and advise® X am sure that NASB representation will be\nvery helpful.\nI am writing our Washington attorney' today saying that w@ will fight and will\nbe willing to attend ary hearings or other proceedings® I will also contact\nsome state organizations for their support in our fight. Let me know if NASB\nis already taking action and what I can do to help.\nSincerely yours.\n(signed) Bob\nR@ J® Coleman\nDirector, WKAR"
