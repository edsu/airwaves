He shouldn't be over-caricatured, but should act out the class¬\nroom teacher more concerned with his own activities than with quietly helping the\nstudents get more from the television lesson. He leans across in front of other students\nto reach for the paper of the student having trouble.. .moves a student so he can sit\nnext to the one needing help.. .makes big, attention-getting gestures to single out\nand quiet noisy students, etc.\nMALE VOICE: A factor forgotten by Mr. D.\n\"YouVe having trouble? Here... let me see I ?\n\"Can you move over? I need your chairl\"\n\"You people stop giggling over therel\"\nDid he think to put on an outside row\nPdpils who might need help? Oh, no I. •\nIn and out and around the aisles...\nHe bumbles his heedless, needless miles...\nObscuring sight and obscuring sounds.. •"
