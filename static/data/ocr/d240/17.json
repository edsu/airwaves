But we must re¬\nmember that we must train our children for life in our own kind of society,with the\nspecial demands it makes on our people.\nQuestions to Think About:\n1. Would you like your children to receive the kind of training Hopi children re¬\nceive? Why?\n2. Do you agree with the Hopi boy that American parents are nervous? How would\nyou change this?\n3- How would you go about teaching responsibility to young people? What factors\nother than the public schools would you involve?\n4. Do you think most Americans believe \"Crime doesn't pay?\" How did they learn\nthis?\n5. Is education confined to the schools? In what other ways are we educated?\n6. Does education stop when formal schooling does? Should it? If not, what kinds\nof educational experiences should people receive after formal schooling?\n20"
