Martini\nThank you very much for sending along your article on the experimental\nstudy of televised dramatisation vs. treatment of plays as literature.\nIt is Indeed the sort of thing wanted for the Journal, and X will use\nit there.\nUnfortunately, I cannot give you a specific publication date. At the\nmoment we are not sure whether we'll be publishing one or two magasines\nafter the first of the year. If two, i'll be able to use your article\nin the January-February Journal, probably} if one, it will be later, as\nI have a backlog of other articles which should be used first because\nof timeliness.\nI believe you had written a while ago to Frank Sohooley suggesting that\nthe Fact Sheets be printed in book form. Via phone, Harold Hill (in\nour Washington headquarters office) asked me to write you and Frank,\nand indicated that I would receive a copy of a letter Frank had written\nin this regard. I've been waiting for that copy, but so far haven't\nseen one—hence the delay in answering your query.\nAnyway, we do already have * books* of Fact Sheets—that is, looseleaf\nvolumes which we compile from reprints of the digests appearing in the\nJournal. Judging from the number of orders we get for these, this seems\nto be rather satisfactory—and it's the cheapest way it can be done.\nJust in case you do not have your copy of the March-April Journal, in\nwhich it appeared, I'm enclosing a copy of the Fact Sheet Index for your\ninformation.\nThanks again.\nSincerely yours.\nPublications Editor\nBMC/dp\nenclosure\nooi tor.
