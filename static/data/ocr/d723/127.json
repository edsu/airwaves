Ray Slavin\n- 2 -\nOctober 12, 1956\nregularly send our members, plus other items which will give you more in¬\nformation about the Association, Of course, Associate and Affiliate mem¬\nbers do not receive as many of these materials as regularly as Active mem¬\nbers do.\nIn addition. Active members with radio stations may use the facilities of\nthe NAEB Radio Network upon payment of an annual fee. The Network distri¬\nbutes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape recording, weekly,\nto members subscribing to its service. This fee is also based on power\n(with the same power classifications as membership) and a new station does\nnot have to pay the full fee until the third year it is in the Network.\nThe fees are*\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\n1st-year\n$400.00\n250.00\n150.00\n$600.00\n375.00\n225.00\nIrA jga:\n$800.00\n500.00\n300.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from\nNetwork Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A sta¬\ntion paying its full third-year rate is paying only a little over $2.00\nan hour for better than 400 hours of programming from the Network in a year.\nThis is about the most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you have fur¬\nther questions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E.
