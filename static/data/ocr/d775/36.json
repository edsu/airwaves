I learn som uch new about it e very d ay\nthat I *m in no haste to commit it to final form.\nAs for budget, I can only guess at it. I could work here\nin Toronto. That would at least enable me to figure the main\ncosts fairly accurately.\nPlease say how soon the entire presentation should be ready.\nHaven*t seen Are You Listening, but shall right away.\nVisit with Gahall of Hagerstown last night here in Toronto. Gave\nme much to think about, at least.\nOne cost not previously considered, Harry, Is secretarial. My\nown affairs have just about ground to a halt for lack of secreÂ¬\ntarial aid. My wife does my typing but has no time to keep my\nnotes, files, and papers in a form that gives me access to them.\nOnce I begin travelling and consulting and gathering materials,\nmy present methods could not cope at all.\nWell, I*m quite sure we are onto something very big and useful,\nindeed, Harry. Look forward to your comments and suggestions\nvery much.\nCordially"
