Williamson\n20 Church Street\nGreenwich, Connecticut\nDecember 8, 1955\nDr. Leo Martin, President,\nAssociation for Education by Radio-Television,\nBoston University, 84 Exeter st.,\nBoston 16, Mass.\nDear Dr. Martin:\nMy efforts to bring in a few new AERT mem¬\nbers for Connecticut are not meeting with much success. I\nhave had a few expressions of interest, but no definite\ncommitments. Do your records show any new members at all\nsince October 20?\nAlso Ifd like some information about AERT chapters. I\nhave been telling some of my prospects that an AERT chapter\nhere in Connecticut would help to develop a group made up\nof both lay citizens and professional educators who could\nbe expected to have some background knowledge of educational\nbroadcasting problems. Ydiere are state and local chapters\nto be found now? And can you easily add the number of mem¬\nbers in each? What is the total membership of the AERT?\nDo you have membership application blanks? If so, I\ncould use a few, as well as any other promotional material\navailable.\nWith the best greetings of the season."
