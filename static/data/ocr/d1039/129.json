The educational television\nbill was not approved by the governor because of legislative action which\nresulted in the demise of a 3$ sales tax from which the educational tele¬\nvision appropriations were to be derived. The term of the commission\nexpired with the failure of approval of the legislation by the governor.\nAt the present time in Virginia there is no central state authority.\nThere are groups representing a large potential for the future:\n1* In Richmond, Superintendent W.

Virginia Polytechnic Institute is interested in network arrange¬\nments for the southwest Virginia and for a means of interconneting its\njunior colleges and extension center, and reaching into mountain communi¬\nties.\n4. Norfolk Public Schools in cooperation with adjacent county and\ncity school systems in the Hampton Roads-Chesapeake Bay area have acti¬\nvated a station on Channel 15 to serve the schools and communities of\nthat area.\n5. Virginia Educational Television, Inc., a lay-group of interested\ncivic leaders, legislators, and educators, while lacking the authority of\nan appointed commission, has potential strength to guide action.\nInformation derived from these sources reflects the great interest\nVirginia has in educational television.
