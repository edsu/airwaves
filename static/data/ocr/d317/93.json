C.\nDear Harold:\nWe f R E GETTING IN PRETTY DEEP NOW ON THE UPCOMING REGION III MEETING\nin Chicago in Mid March. It is my understanding from working with\nTHE ONE AT MUNCIE LAST YEAR THAT THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD\nNOT CHARGE A SUFFICIENT REGISTRATION FEE TO TAKE CARE OF OUT OF\nPOCKET EXPENSES OF THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO ATTEND THE VARIOUS MEETINGS\nOR TO PROVIDE DINNER TICKETS FOR VIPfS OR OTHERS?\nI KNOW I AM ASKING A REALLY SILLY QUESTION BECAUSE I AM FAMILIAR\nENOUGH WITH THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE TOTAL NAEB TO KNOW THAT\nTHERE IS NO MONEY AVAILABLE FOR REGION MEETINGS, BUT I FIGURED THAT\nI BETTER ASK ANYWAY AND THUS HAVE THE DECKS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. We HAVE\nA MEETING COMING UP IN CHICAGO ON JANUARY 8T H WHICH I WILL TRY TO ATTEND\nAND I WOULD LIKE TO GO AS WELL FORTIFED AS I CAN. ALONG THIS LINE IT\nWOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF YOU COULD SEND ME ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE\nON WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING OR HAVE DONE AS FAR AS REGIONAL MEETINGS ARE\nCONCERNED. THIS SHOULD BY ALL MEANS INCLUDE PRICES AS WELL AS PROGRAM\nIDEAS.\nHope that you and yours have had a real fine Christmas time and that\n1963 WILL BE THE BEST YEAR YET FOR YOU AND THE NAEB.\nDirector Radio-TV\nJSM/sc"
