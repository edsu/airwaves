Says, In parti\n\"I*ra very much in favor of using the COOPER UNION FORUM\nseries of programs.* From this I wrongly Inferred that\nyou meant all three CTJF series, not one or two of them*\nAnd I note that on the Score Card dated July 15 all three\nseries are listed as Cooper Union, not just one of them\nas you say in the footnote to your latest letter (July 21)*\nFrom what data I have available, Waldo, I do think I am right\nabout Bun giving a \"yes\" to all three series* But there may be some¬\nthing I1 vo missed or overlooked* If I*in wrong and you want me to\nyank the Philosophy series. I’ll sure do it*\nShould I attempt to verify ray conclusion with Bun? Or perhaps\nyou would like to query him*\nBy the way, don11 worry about our putting \"four from one source\nin one package,\" as you say in your footnote* ’Cause we ain’t,\nexactly* Not at the same time* If we ran more than one CNF, we\nrun ’em \"end to end** This means one will begin Oct, 3, a second\non Dee. 15, and the third on philosophy—unless we withdraw it—on\nFeb. 6, 1955.\nOne other rather important matter? We do not* as a matter of\nfact, have a huge backlog of approvals. We have only about four\napproved series which haven’t been definitely scheduled and offered\nto the stations. I hope plenty of acceptable stuff keeps coming in,\nbecause we are going to need it very soon* I want to get to work\non the next offering—time slides by too fasti\nBest personal regards,\nSincerely,\nJHtcp\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager"
