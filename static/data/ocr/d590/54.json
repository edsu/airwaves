General Method: A series of regional workshops will he held to which will\nbe invited coordinators and planners of in-school broadcasts, studio teachers,\nproducers of such programs, classroom teachers who use these media in their\nclassrooms, educational administrators,and faculty members from teacher-training\ninstitutions. Emphasis will be given to this latter group, because it is they\nwho have the responsibility of training new teachers in the proper use of these\nnew media, a responsibility which is now being inadequately met.\nThese workshops will be held in various sections of the country, at app>\npriate installations and institutions, as has been the case with previous NAEB\nworkshops and seminars. Participants will be carefully selected to include repre\nsentatives from school systems of different sizes, different grade levels,\ndifferent subject matter fields, etc. Each workshop will last approximately\nthree weeks and will be devoted to experimentation in the best methods of pre¬\nsenting different materials.\nSome of the problems on which these workshop-demonstrations will provide\nvalid data, materials, and conclusions would include, among others:\nA) The effectiveness of different procedures for\n(4) lecture versus discussion approaches *-\n(5) \"feedback” techniques\n(6) student participation and motivation\nB) The use and role of visual and aural aids in ETV and radio instruction.\nC) Analyses of ways to preserve balance between TV and radio as now tools—\nso TV’s greater facility in handling things that ace tangible and\nperceivable (and therefore self-evident), for example, will not be\nallowed to cause basic needs of a less rvisualizable11 nature to be\nneglected. /\nD) Analysis of teacher qualifications and viteacher--team\" procedural and\ncooperation.\nE) Teacher training films, videotapes ani/cr kiiicsc 0 3\nfilms, in valid and successful utilization techniques."
