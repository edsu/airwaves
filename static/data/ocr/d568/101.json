You are urged to read this before the\nmeeting in Columbus.\nThis was prepared as a means of giving a complete report to you of\nthe work of the Adult Education Committee so that you will be in a better posi¬\ntion to ask questions.\nIt is obviously impossible for me, as chairman of the Adult Education\nCommittee, to make a satisfactory report in the ten minutes assigned in the\nagenda of the April 16 meeting at Columbus. I shall assume that those present\nat the meeting will have read the attached report of the work of the Adult Edu¬\ncation Committee. I propose to use the ten minutes to speak about the current\ndevelopments on the Adult Education Committee project and to raise certain\npolicy questions for consideration by the Board.\nSincerely yours.\nGeorge E.'Trobst, Chairman\nAdult Education Committee\nGeorge E,"
