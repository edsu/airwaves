The new articles and by-laws should be voted on by\nthe membership at the New York meeting. You may\nconstrue the mail vote as advisory but I would not\nrecommend that these ballots be counted in the final\ndecision. Instead, only the ballots cast at the\nNew York meeting should be considered.\n2. Either Marcus or I will be present at the NAEB\nmeeting. There is a chance that I will have to\ngo to Mexico City on that date, in which case\nMarcus will attend.\n3. We should like to have you schedule this meeting\nfor Friday, October 29 and one of us will arrive\non the evening previous.\nWill you please let us know when the Board expects to meet\nso that we may plan on coming to the meeting if it is at all\npossible to do so.\n. Marks"
