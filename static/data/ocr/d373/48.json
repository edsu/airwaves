We have done no\nprograms on the ghetto but I thought you might want to know of an award\nwinning film we produced in 1963. A 16mm color film, SPRING COMES TO\nVINTROUX, documents the actions taken by citizens of a small community\nnear Charleston which — with the help of the WVU Cooperative Extension\nService — worked together for the betterment of a community which had\nnot kept abreast of, the times. Narrated by Frank Blair of NBC News the\nprogram won two first-place awards in national competitions. It has been\ndistributed by EEN and I feel has a positive timely message regarding\ncommunity team work.\nI will'keep you appraised of any future production efforts which\nmight relate to your project.\nProgramming Operations Manager\nbp\nEastern Educational Network • Educational Television Stations of National Association of Educational Broadcasters •\nNational Educational Television Network • Wes/ Virginia Broadcasters Association • West Virginia Educational\nBroadcasting Authority » West Virginia Educational Television Council"
