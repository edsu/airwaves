Is your contri¬\nbution as broadcasters to the world you live in of consequence, of\nreal importance?\nI know what your stations are doing. I know their positive\ncontributions--and I know their lacks. I know how hard you are\ntrying. And I know that this college generation is the most vital\none in thirty years--you have, played aa important role in affecting\nworld historyS- in'tha issue of peac© ©r war* in international relations,\nend in domestic and world politics. So I know that where your\n\\ ’\ncontributions as broadcasters are peripheral it is not because this\ncollege generation, as a group, is alienated or incapable.\nCommunications--and many of you as individuals--have been the\nvictims of the cultural lag of the universities of this country that\nby and large are dedicated either to the 16th century or to the anti-\ncultural materialism that bypasses people and emotions and intellectual\nchoice for the nuts and bolts primary of test tubes and atom-splitting\nmachines.\nAnd this is the third and final discussion topic I want to discuss\nwith you here today. A topic for your thinking and discussion and,\nhopefully, action, in the days and months and years ahead. A discussion\ntopic that, when you get right down to it, may be more basic and\nimportant than all others to your own preparation for the media field."
