  "text": "Questions and Problems Suggested by the WOSU Staff\nNAEB NETWORK\nThis report presents the thinking of WOSU staff members\non the question of improving the services which NAEB renders\nto university stations. It is quite likely that some of the\nquestions, suggestions, and criticisms also apply to NAEB\nservices to other types of educational stations.\nRecording Quality of NAEB Programs\nGenerally speaking the recording quality of programs\nreceived from the Network have not been of satisfactory\nbroadcast quality. This may be due to poor recording at\nthe originating point or for other reasons. Whatever the\ncause our engineering staff reports that the frequency re¬\nsponse of these tapes is often poor, probably because of\nimproper head alignment. In some cases it would seem that\npoor production at pick up source was the difficulty.\nWe suggest that this problem be explored at the pro¬\nposed meeting with attempt to arrive at certain minimum\nstandards. We suggest also that consideration be given to\nthe possibility of preparing a small booklet which would\nset forth such standards along with basic suggestions for\noperation and maintenance of tape recording equipment. The\nlatter would be especially valuable where an adequate\nengineering staff is not available to operate and maintain\nthe equipment. Perhaps it would even be possible for the\nNAEB to arrange for teams of technical specialists to visit\nstations to conduct on-the-job training programs of station\npersonnel in recording techniques."
