G.\nDear Waltert\nReceived copy of March 23, 1959, Press Conference Statement by Fleniaing.\nBut isn't there a later release which, though briefly, listed (as being\nnegotiated) our \"Understanding Media\" proposal?\nThe latter, incidentally, is looking better. Fortunately JfoLuhan isn't\nwaiting until September to get geared up. He's in New Xork right now\nin conferences with Foahay, Becker, Gerrard (at NBC) and others, has in\nthe mill some specific plans with CBC for materials and testing, and is\nmeeting (with ms) on the 10th with Gilbert Seldes at the new Annenberg\nSchool (University of Pennsylvania) to discuss their involvensmt in this.\nSeldes has been calling for this sort of thing in his books and articles\nfor some time.\nRqy Hall writes that he's optimistic about getting Derthick to make\nopening remarks at Washington Conference. If both Flemming and he are\nthere, we'll be well blessed. If Derthick is there. Hall says he doesn't\nwant to talk. You, therefore, will be the one to \"lay out the background\nproblem and expectations\" of the Conference. Incidentally, this has been\ntaking more and more time, and is looking better end better.\nSee you Wednesdiy.\nBest regards.\nHJStJO\nHany J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
