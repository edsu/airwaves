Television fosters the nuclear effect partly be¬\ncause of another kind of constricted time—the need to pack as much\n\"sell\" as possible into the shortest, hence least expensive, amount\nof time. There is also, of course, the extensive obsession wiLth\ntime in modern literature (Proust, Mann, Stein, Joyce, Woolf, Wolfe,\nGide, Eliot, and more recently Lawrence Durrell and the existential¬\nists) and modern philosophy.\nI have digressed at such length in the hope that some of these ideas\nmay be new, and useful, to you/ I am hardly an expert in the field,\nbut I would be very interested in working with you in any way possible\non your project, as an assistant or simply as an interested observer.\nIf I can be of any use to you or Mr. McLuhan, would you please let\nme know? I have several years of free time before I plan to enter\ngraduate school. But I will spare you more until I hear from you—\nThank you again for your help.\nSincerely yours.\nRichard Rhodes\nScience Depaistmenl"
