Provides a good windmill to go around attacking\nPancho-like.\nSecurity of broadcasting is important. No single government agency\nhas outlined one program for security. This is problem of\nbroadcasters themselves.\nTake care of your own problem.\nThere will be no blanketing of frequencies.\nTelevision frequencies (2-6) may be required for training.\nMilitary equipment on these frequencies essentially for use\noutside this country.\nMen in field - will determine what stations go off.\nStations will stay under control of government agency where they\nnow are."
