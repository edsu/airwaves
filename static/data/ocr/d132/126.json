  "text": "Mr. Dean Gregory\nOctober 31, 1963\nI want to be clear, Dean, that our interest la having the basic course\ndeveloped by someone else does not in any way represent any dissatisfaction\nwith your professional competence and ability. It was probably an\nimposition in the first place to try to find one man who was not only an\naccomplished linguist and teacher, but who was also an experienced radio\nwriter. We feel that this new arrangement has possibilities for\nproviding us with both talents within the same organisation, and that\nthis arrangement should enable us to move along with greater dispatch\nto provide the materials to the Voice of America as soon as possible.\nWe would appreciate having you complete the materials upon which you\nare working at the moment and sending them to us as soon as they are\nfinished.\nKind regards.\nSincerely,\nJAP: sc\nJames A. Fellows\nAssistant Director"
