My best wishes in\nthis regard, and let me give you any assistance I can either in making things\nclear for you to go over or in giving you addresses of a few folks to meet once\nyou get over there.\nToday's mail brings an armful of carbon copies from Sy Siegel. I have been\ntoo busy to read the last couple batches, but I shall certainly look at them in\nthe next few days. Sy really gives the U. S. mail a workout when he takes any¬\nthing up, doesn't he?--I\nMy best wishes to you and the family, and may you have luck with the legis¬\nlature.\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nVice President\nBP:cjm"
