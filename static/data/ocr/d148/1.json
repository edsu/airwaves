S. Bittner, Watson Diclcerman, Helen Duncan, A. L. Knoblauch, Harvey Lang, O. B. Zehmer\nPublished in 10 iasues, September to July, Office of the Secretary and Editor, W. S. Bittner, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana\nVol. XVIII June, 1953 No. 10\nPresident’s Column\nIn the Bulletin for May, 1953, I listed\nnine suggestions that were made by the\nchairmen of the 1952-53 committees.\nJudging from the letters I have been\nreceiving, many others also approve\nsome of the ideas involved. A few went\na step further and added their own\nsuggestions. One of these was that\nthe business meeting might be held on\nthe second day of the annual conference\nwith the third day being devoted en¬\ntirely to workshops.\nEven though I may be accused of\ngiving too much importance to com¬\nmittee structure, I nevertheless ask you\nto think with me as I try to analyze\nthe types of committees that we have\nand their functions. Although many\nclassifications might be made I suggest\nthe following as one possibility.\nA. Executive Committee\nThis is the only committee having\nexecutive functions and the only one\nelected by the NUEA general member¬\nship. Appointment of other committees\nis now the official responsibility of the\npresident. The general custom is for\nhim, prior to making appointments, to\nutilize the assistance of the executive\ncommittee and the recommendations of\ndirectors and committee chairmen. If,\nat the time of his election, the vice-\npresident should also be officially rec¬\nognized as the president-elect for the\nfollowing year, last month’s suggestion\nthat this appointive power be trans¬\nferred to the vice-president would mean\nmerely that he would be making the\nappointments for the year of his presi¬\ndency while he was still vice-president.\nB. Organizational Committees\nThe work of these committees relates\nto the total membership of the NUEA\nand not to any group or specialized type.\nActually their activities are in those\nareas in which our mutual problems are\npulled together and organized in such\na way that emphasis is given and\naction is promoted to produce results\nthat we could not achieve individually:\nEditorial and Publications\nFederal Government Relations\nInstitutional Cooperation\nPreparation of Extension Leaders\nRelations with Professional and Trade\nAssociations\nReports and Business Practices\nResearch\nC. Representational Committees\nIn this group are included those com¬\nmittees wnose members represent the\nNUEA in organizations in wmch we hold\nmembership, or in which we cooperate\nwith organizations similar to ours. As\ncan be readily understood, intimate\nknowledge oi the NUuia and its activities\nover a period of years is one of the\nprime requisites for membership on\nthese committees.\nAmerican Council on Education\nCouncil of National Organizations\nFilm Council of America\nUNESCO\nD. Activity Committees\nThese are the “do” committees. They\nare concerned with the development and\nbetterment of the planning, conduct, and\nevaluation of our various on-going ac¬\ntivities. As the activity tends to dictate\nmembership qualifications, membership\nin these committees is generally assign¬\ned to individuals who have some responsi¬\nbility in their institutions for the activ¬\nity involved. • Moreover, in most cases\nthe committee work is of such a nature\nthat some degree of continuity of mem¬\nbership is advisable. Incidently few\ninstitutions have all the activities\nlisted in this group, and whether they\ndo or do not the activities may or may\nnot be listed under the heading of\nextension. Then, too, other activities\nwhich are not shown below in the list\nof active committees are carried on by\nsome NUEA members. We may expect\nto see the strength of these committees\nand their volume of work ebb and flow\nwith the vagaries of time and the changes\nin personnel in the NUEA and in our\nindividual institutions.\nAudio-Visual Aids\nCommunity Organization\nConferences and Institutes\nCorrespondence Study\nDiscussion and Debate Materials and\nInterstate Cooperation\nEvening Colleges and Class Extension\nImplications of Atomic Energy\nNUEA WORKSHOP\nA Regional Workshop for extension\npersonnel is to be held July 12, 13, and\n14 at Limberlost Camp in northeastern\nIndiana. The camp is under the di¬\nrection of Purdue University; it is lo¬\ncated at Oliver Lake, six miles south of\nLaGrange and just west of State Road 9.\nMr. C. W. Beese of Purdue University\nis chairman of the committee for the\nWorkshop. Extension faculty and staff\nmembers from the states surrounding In¬\ndiana, and perhaps from Minnesota, Mis¬\nsouri, and Iowa will attend. The first\nsession is at 6 p.m. on Sunday.\n1954 CONVENTION\nThe next NUEA convention will be\nheld on May 9 to 12, 1954, at the River¬\nside Hotel, Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Res¬\nervations may be made directly with Mr.\nWhaley, Manager of the hotel.\nCivil Defense\nThe American Legion Building in East\nSt. Louis provided the facilities for a\nshort course in civil defense in May.\nThe course was planned and conducted\nby the Division of University Extension,\nUniversity of Illinois, in close coopera¬\ntion with representatives of the Civil\nDefense Council and the Chamber of\nCommerce.\nThose who participated actively in\nplanning, developing, and conducting the\nprogram are: Dean Robert B. Browne,\nLawrence Miller, Director of Civil De¬\nfense; Curtis Hughes, Assistant Director;\nCharles Spilker, Secretary, Chamber of\nCommerce; Fred W. Steuernagel and\nWalter Browne, Field Representatives;\nand Byron Fulk, Conference Supervisor\non the campus.\nIndustrial Relations and Worker’s\nEducation\nLectures and Concert Artists\nRadio and Television\nTechnical Institutes\nWorld Affairs\nExtension Information and Library\nServices\nI shall proceed with the appointment\nof Committees, again asking you direc¬\ntors and committee chairmen to send\nme your recommendations.\nEverrett J.
