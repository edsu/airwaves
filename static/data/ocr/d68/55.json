Do you think this television lesson requires, suggests, or\ninvites any specific activities in preparation or follow-\nthrough? Do you think an inexperienced teacher could use\nthis lesson effectively?\n10. Is it normal to spend the amount of class and pupil time util¬\nizing one lesson? How could Mrs. Arnold justify using so\nmuch time?\n11. Have any of you experienced instructional television as\nstudents? How do you feel about its contributions to your\nown learning? What in particular stands out in your memory\nabout it?\nIt is, of course, not necessary to cover all of these questions at\nthe time of the demonstration, and you (or the members of your group)\nmay have questions of your own you would prefer to ask.
