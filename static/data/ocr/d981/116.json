Because of the growing importance and magnitude of this develop¬\nment, the NAEB Professional Advancement Committee, following the advice\nof various distinguished consultants, beginning with Professor Harold\nLasswell at the NAEB national convention some six years ago, have called\nfor the appointment of a Director of Professional Advancement to coordin¬\nate the many professional and training activities which the NAEB is\ncalled upon to handle.\nThe Coordinator requested would work out joint projects with other\nprofessional associations. He would work towards the creation of increas¬\ningly high professional standards and skills for educational stations\nand their staffs, codes of operation, and principles of social responsi¬\nbility which, we believe, could well eventually affect the entire\ncommercial broadcasting industry as well. In such efforts, the coopera¬\ntion and experience of all other interested organizations would be\nsolicited and used. The NAEBrs present Organ!national Liaison (Advisory)\nCommittee will be further developed in this connection.\nThe budget listed below includes $80,000 per year for seminars, work¬\nshops, workshop grants-!n-aid, and scholarships not separately budgeted\nfor In the other requests listed above and below.\nSalary--Coordlnator $16,500\nSalaries—Secretarial 5,500\nSupplies and Expenses 5,000\nConsultation Services 20,000\n^Scholarships 25,000\nWorkshops and Seminars 20,000\nWorkshop Grants-In-Aid 15.000\n$107,000\n^Includes continuation of present minimal grant types (20 per year for\naverage of $250.00), the addition of Experts in Residence ($10,000.00)\nand foreign exchange study grants ($10,000.00).\n13"
