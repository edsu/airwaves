Skoraia, Executive Director\nRAEB\nUniversity of Illinois\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Mr. Skornia:\nThis letter is being written on behalf df Ifclix Bonvouloir who,\nI understand,is applying for a position with your organization\nas an engineer0\nHr0 Bonvouloir was employed at WAAB for a period of about two\nyears, during which time he discharged his duties as Chief En¬\ngineer with credit. During this time we applied for a tele¬\nvision license, which involved a competitive hearing* Ibis of\ncourse required a great deal of paper work. We did not find\nit necessary to hire a consulting engineer, as is normal, be¬\ncause of Mr. Bonvouloir8e outstanding qualifications. His a-\nbility relieved us of this expense. I might add that we were\nsuccessful, so that the work was obviously done properly.\nMr. Bonvouloir left of his own volition for a higher salary\nand I am sure that you will find his services highly satisfactory.\nGFWjmm\nSincerely yours,\nWAAB, INC.\n/s/ George F. Wlteom\nGeorge F. Wilson\nCopy made March 11, 1954\nNAEB Headquarters"
