One of\nevery six high schools has less than\n100 students. Even the best teach¬\ners in these schools cannot teach all\nsubjects well; often some subjects\nare not taught at all. Reaching into\nthe most isolated school, etv insures\nthat thousands of students are not\ndeprived of essential subjects.\nThe explosion of knowledge—By\nincreasing the time available to\nteachers and college faculty mem¬\nbers, etv helps them continue the\nself-education that is a teacher’s\nlifelong responsibility. Also, tele¬\nvision lessons cover more ground\nand, in effect, stretch the capacity\nof existing courses to absorb new\nmaterial. And when new curricula\n34\nIndirectly, the Ford Foundation has provided\nsupport for college-level ETV instruction by aid\nto ETV stations and to state and regional net¬\nworks.\nDirectly, the Foundation has committed about\n$1,850,000 for the salaries of faculty members re¬\nleased from regular academic duties to spend\nfull time for the presentation of credit courses\non about fifty campuses. Through these grants,\nmoreover, first-rate faculty members can teach—\nthrough videotape recordings or through net¬\nworks like Oregon’s —at many colleges and uni¬\nversities other than their own. And through ETV,\nfuture generations of students will see such mem¬\norable courses as those now being recorded by\nWalter Prescott Webb, one of the great living his¬\ntorians, on the Great Plains and Great Frontier.\n“Continental Classroom” caught the humor and\nhuman interest of the nation. Here was a serious,\nwell-taught academic course in modern physics,\ntelecast daily from coast to coast at the yawn-\nfilled hour of 6:30 A.M. Parents marveled at the\nsudden alertness of formerly late-waking teen¬\nagers ; in the first week of the course, 13,000 text¬\nbooks were sold; Catholic institutions rearranged\nMass schedules to permit viewing by students\nand clerical teachers; a blind high-school senior\nlistened while his mother read him the equations\nwritten on the blackboard. In all, 400,000 persons\nwatched the course the first year it was telecast,\nbeginning in October, 1958, over 157 stations of\nthe National Broadcasting Company network."
