It has not had the\nstudy and analysis needed to secure adequate data for an evaluation.\nSuch evaluation would seem to be an important aspect of\nthis operation. It is, therefore, recommended that the Board\nestablish definite intervals for the submission of reports on\nthe activities of the network.\nPrograms\nThe heart of the network operation is, of course, the\nsource of programs. Up till now we have been largely dependent\non station WNYC. Ve have had some excellent series. Sometimes,\nthrough no onefs fault, the method has resulted in confusion. The\nplan has not been one geared to optimal service to the network.\nThere has been little planning ahead. There has been little conÂ¬\nsideration given to the specific needs of the school stations.\nSome effort has been made to plan ahead toward a program\nschedule for next fall. As part of this plan we are attempting to\nfind some school programs, which require even a greater period of\npre-planning. These plans have progressed very slowly.\nWhat is needed is a mechanism that will be able to give\nserious attention to programs. It will take considerable time\nand effort. Such a mechanism should have the responsibility of\nprogram procurement, and the power of decision as to what is to\nbe offered over the network. It would operate within the freamework\nof over-rail policy as established by the NAEB board.\nWith the forthcoming financial aid it seems possible to\nplan ahead with a basic balanced schedule, allowing at the same time\nsufficient flexibility to add additional offerings as they become\navailable 0\n-19-"
