Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University Press, 1947.\nPp. 96-121.\nSHOULD RADIO HAVE AN EDITORIAL POLICY?\nJAMES LAWRENCE FLY1\nIn 1940, in the now famous “mayflower” decision of\nthe Federal Communications Commission, the Commission\nstated that:\n“Under the American system of broadcasting it is clear that\nresponsibility for the conduct of a broadcast station must rest\ninitially with the broadcaster. It is equally clear that with the\nlimitations in frequencies inherent in the nature of radio, the\npublic interest can never be served by a dedication of any\nbroadcast facility to the support of his own partisan ends. Radio\ncan serve as an instrument of democracy only when devoted to\nthe communication of information and the exchange of ideas\nfairly and objectively presented. A truly free radio cannot be\nused to advocate the causes of the licensee. It cannot be used\nto support the candidacies of his friends. It cannot be devoted\nto the support of principles he happens to regard most favor¬\nably. In brief, the broadcaster cannot be an advocate.\n“Freedom of speech on the radio must be broad enough to\nprovide full and equal opportunity for the presentation to the\npublic of all sides of public issues. Indeed, as one licensed to\noperate in a public domain the licensee has assumed the obli¬\ngation of presenting all sides of important public questions,\nfairly, objectively and without bias. The public interest—not\nthe private—is paramount. These requirements are inherent in\n1 American Civil Liberties Union, N. Y."
