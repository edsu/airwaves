This\nideology is that human considerations come first and that the sanctity\nof the personality and freedom of the mind are the most precious of\nhuman possessions.\nCommenting on the ’’Jeffersonian Heritage\" series of radio programs,\nMr. Probst said:\n\"We are engaged in producing programs of the quality of rHenry V',\nor Sherwood's 'Abraham Lincoln in Illinois', or MacLeish's 'The Fall\nof the City'. We are trying to produce programs that are 'consumer\ndurables'. We are trying to produce programs that can be rebroadcast\nten or twenty years from now to both our satisfaction and the satisfaction\nof the listener.\n\"We are doing this really against the w'hole current of American\nwriting and American commercial radio, which are devoted to the\nproduction of programs that are really 'consumer perishables' ---\nAt no previous time in American radio has there been an occasion when\nanybody had the funds, or thought it was worthwhile to try to create an\noutstanding series of programs about Jefferson, or about any other out¬\nstanding American\n-30-"
