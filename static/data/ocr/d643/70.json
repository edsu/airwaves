  "text": ",\nDr. Burton Paulu\nPage 2\n5/21/57\nI had another notion, myself, regarding the problems we had\ndiscussed earlier regarding the involvement of the various groups in\nNAEB activities. I wondered whether the Committee on Constitution and\nBy-Laws might not examine the potential good and evil arising out of a\nsystem of directors and associate directors for each region now that we\nhave grown so large. This would increase representation; and while if\nall were given a vote and a voice it might ma^e Board meetings a little\ndifficult, merely the presence of half dozen other people probably wouldn't\nhurt anything and would serve to break in a good bit of new blood on the\nBoard, And with this, I let you up.\nBest personal regards.\n?\nâœ“7\nSincerely yotfrs.\nit.
