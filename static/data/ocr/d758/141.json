All I have heard is irresponsible talk\nabout **the NAEB had better do this (or that)—or else.”\nAs you know, we, the members, are the NAEB. (This is not true of\nsome other organizations.) If reorganization is needed (and it is,\nin my opinion), we have an obligation to propose methods of accomolishing it.\nI would be most grateful to have your comments and those all other\nNAEB members from ETV stations.\nIt was a pleasure to be with you at the Region II Conference, and\nI look forward to seeing you soon again.\nCordially,\nSt. Paul 13, Minnesota\nccs Managers of all ETV\nstations\nNAEB Board"
