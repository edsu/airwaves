McCarty, Bert Harrison, Jack Summerfield\nFrank Schooley, Fred Rainsberry, Seth Spaulding\nFROM: William G. Harley\nDATE: February 27, 1964\nThis year we are establishing a new standing committee within the NAEB to be called\nthe Resolutions Committee; I should like very much to have you serve on this\ncommittee. Harry Skornia has already agreed to serve as chairman.\nBecause of the experience at the iViilwaukee Convention, it was deemed advisable\nnot to make the composition of resolutions a matter of last-minute convention-time\nactivity. If resolutions are to be significant and truly reflect the best interests and\nconvictions of the Association, they must be evolved with great care and be preceded\nby considerable pulse-taking. I am convinced that the NAEB convention is growing\nto a size where a thoughtfully prepared resolution of the delegates assembled can\ncarry real weight in national decision-making. Conversely, hastily constructed\nstatements can lead to ill-considered judgments leading to unfortunate consequences.\nFollowing the established procedure, the committee will consist of the chairman and\nnine members who have staggered terms, with three rotating off the committee each\nyear. In order to constitute the committee initially, and thus set up this rotation, I\nam asking Graydon, Keith, and Ray to accept one-year terms; Mac, Bert, and Jack,\ntlaiÂ»e-year terms; and Frank, Fred, and Seth, three-year terms.\nI sincerely hope that you will accept this important assignment.\nWGH:mab\ncc: Dr. Harry J. Skornia"
