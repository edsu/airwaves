I will investigate that matter and let\n1 know as soon as I get a definite answer. X have a sneaking suspicion,\nhowever, that we might have to settle for a more conventional rectangular\nshape. Tills, for purely economic reasons. If I am not mistaken, the printing\non the ribbon that you suggest would be relatively inexpensive, but the process\nof cutting tho paper could run rather high. However, I will find out definitely.\nDo you think it would be of advantage to have a place on the ribbon for each\nIndividual’s name, purely for identification purposes?\nI would also suggest that, in addition to having the girls from AKHho take\ncharge of the ribbonr-pinning, we might also arm them with quantities of membership\nliterature which they could distribute at random. If you go along with this Idea,\nI will sgo that we have enough extra copies of our membership blurb made up.\nYou will notice, too, in my letter to Dr. Tyler, that I spoke of the\npossibility of our having a couple of easels available. %• thought here was that\nwe could have two large posters made up ... one, a ‘*welcoao to the convention”\ntype of thing ... and trie other, som brief copy to help get people to the\nmembership desk.\nThose are ay thoughts at the moment. Professor Adkins. If anything else\noccurs to no. I’ll let you know immediately. In the meantime, I’d appreciate\nbeing kept informed on ary ideas that may com© up from you, fram Mrs. Broderick,\nor from Professor Staaheff.\nI’ll look forward to the pleasure of meeting you in Columbus.\nKindest personal regards.\nSincerely,\nJohn Adams Rourke\nNational Membership Chairman\nAF.RT\nenc."
