These steps would be followed\nby screening, production, and distribution phases.\nThe NAEB Utilization Committee is undertaking to carry out the\nfirst two steps of this plan. The development and distribution steps\nwill need to be financed from outside of the NAEB. There are several\npossibilities for this financing and they will be contacted at the\nproper time.
