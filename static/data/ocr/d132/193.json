  "text": "> foestion XX? Are there any reasons -why the placement of such a UBXA\ncourse would involve subsequent difficulties and disadvantages\nto other areas of your program? If so, would such advantages,\ndisadvantages, if any, outweigh—in your opinion—the potential\nadvantages?\nInterpretation of responses cannot Bake clear whether the answers\ngiven apply to part 1 or to part 2 of the question, or to both.\n********\nWithout attempting to offer suggestions for wording of questions, additional\ntopic® which might be included profitably in any future questionnaire include the\nfollowingi\n1. Alternative approaches to the teaching of English by radio and\nsupplementary efforts needed#\n2* *31© relative worth of such approaches and means for their evaluation#\n3. The need for supplementary instructional materials of different\nkinds (e.g. texts, tests, films, recordings).\nk, The need for follow-up activities in the form of participation in\nGlasses and other opportunities for use of the newly-learned\nlanguage.\n5. The worth of particular program formats—i.e# methods of introduction,\nuse of music, announcer*• accent, etc. in relationship to local\ncultural habits and anticipated responses.\n6# Probable effects of efforts aside by ether agencies, especially\nthose carried forward by means other than broadcasting.\nT* Availability of receiver# for Individual home and/cr group use.\n********\nIn designing a future questionnaire, questions should b# so constructed\nso as to simplify machine coding and tabulation of responses as well as eoiy\ncorrelation of responses to several questions. In particular, correlation of\ngeographic location and/or political alliance would be useful in terms of each\nquestion asked# A3 so useful would probably be country site and population,\nnumber of radio receives* in area served by post, etc.\nDespite the foregoing and other inadequacies of the questionnaire, the\nmajority of the posts appeared to give it serious attention and to go out of\ntheir way to comprehend questions and give significant answers to each question\nrr.lsed* For this reason, despite all limitations noted, the questionnaire is\nbelieved to have accomplished its goal."
