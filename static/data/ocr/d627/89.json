Do you interpret his\n3rd paragraph to mean that he is expecting\na consultation fee from us (I didn't recall that\nthat was in the \"bargain\"), or do you think he\nis merely using the term in the same sense I\nintended it in the second paragraph of my letter?\nI think the latter (based on his letter of 6/10,\nalso attached), but I guess his latest wording\nsorta worried me - so your comments will be\nappreciated.\nheh\n6/21/60"
