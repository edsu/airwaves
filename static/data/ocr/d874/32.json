The expenditures in June, 1957 were considerably greater than those\nin June, 1956, and since the Administrative charge is always made on expendi¬\ntures of th© previous month the charge actually is less than 5% of actual expend!\ntures during the fiscal period July 1, 1956 - June 30, 1957, even though covering\na twelve-month period.)"
