The NAEB is proud of the role it has been privileged to play in this\neffort.\nGrants-in-Aid\nIn 1952, and again in 1953, the FAE made a grant of $80,000 to the\nNAEB to be used for both radio and television program Grants-in-Aid to enable\neducational stations to produce outstanding programs that otherwise would\nhave been impossible for them to undertake. The purpose of these grants was\nnot to underwrite the entire cost of production of the programs, but rather to\nprovide additional sums (up to $7,000 per series) to permit the station to\nsecure the services of the outstanding content authority, writer, producer,\nor other specialist, needed to make new planned series truly outstanding\nrather than merely adequate. A number of these grants, allocated to several\nstations, resulted in several excellent series for national distribution.\nThere was a second important purpose, in addition to that of providing,\nimmediately, excellent programs for the educational stations. It was hoped,\nand later found to be true, that these grants would enable recipients to estab¬\nlish standards and win local administrative support for funds and personnel\nto maintain these standards, which would carry over after such grants were\nno longer available. Several of these programs won national awards and this\ndesired result has begun to be achieved. The pride generated in the entire\nparent educational institution has begun to insure more adequate financial\nand administrative support. Statements by grant recipients, reflecting this\nimportant aspect ot the grant program* may be found in Appendix t „"
