Bookshester\nProgram Development\nUnited States National Student Association\n2115 S Street, N.W.\nWashington, D. C. 20008\nDear Mr. Bookshester:\nThis is a further response to your letter of March 7 requesting help\nfor student-operated radio.\nWe have now received the report, jointly sponsored by the Foundation\nand the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, on student-ope rated college\nradio stations, which was done as a supplement to the Public Radio Study.\nIn evaluating the findings of these studies, it has become clear that the\nlimited funds we have available for radio should, at least for the next\nseveral years, be utilized to support the public radio system in this\ncountry, including, ultimately, some national interconnection system.\nTherefore, we will not be able to provide assistance for student-\noperated stations.\nhi making this decision, we do not wish to imply any lack of faith or\nenthusiasm for the student stations. We believe that these stations\nperform a useful function, both as a social activity and as a service\nto the communities which they serve. We wish that it were possible\nfor us to help, but the needs in the other areas of public broadcasting\nare too great to make that possible.\nSincerely yours,\nDavid M. Davis\nProgram Officer\nsigned in Mr. Davis' absence"
