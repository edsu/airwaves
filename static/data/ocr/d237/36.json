Assoc, of Educational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUr b ana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nRecently you sent along a draft of a proposed letter to\ngo to all holders of educational television channels regarding\nthe NAEB's Placement Service.\nI appreciated your thoughtfulness in sending this along\nand I regret that the extremely heavy schedule of the past ten\ndays or so has prevented earlier comment on my part.\nAs I am sure you know, we feel that the proper limits of\nour concern in matters of this kind are confined to the references\nto the Fund and the nature of the grant. In these respects your\nsuggested draft strikes me as very good indeed—as it does in all\nrespects for that matter.\nIf you haven’t yet gone to press, I do have one suggestion.\nThe last sentence in the first paragraph could read: \"Full time\noperation is now possible through a grant from The Fund for Adult\nEducation\". (While we used to request it, it is not really necessary\nto add \"an independent organization established by The Ford Foundation\".)\nThis, however, is not too important a point and if there is any\nawkwardness for you in making the change, forget it.\nFor our records here, we would appreciate a copy or two\nof the announcement as it finally goes out.\nAgain, many thanks.\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nAPR 29 I3b4\nAM Pf»\n7l8|?|10|ll|12|l|2|3|4|6|p\ni\nSincerely yours,\nGHG-.EH"
