Underwood\nNetwork Manager\nN A E B\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Robert:\nMany thanks for your letter of July 2.\nThis is just a quickie to tell you we had a mis-hap with the script\nfor Program No, 8. The stencil was lost in mimeographing, and the\noriginal destroyed before we had time to check back to script writers*.\nRarely does such a thing happen, but the stencil just disappeared, and\nnot a single copy run off.\nThis means,,, the only way I now have to get a script together from\nProgram No, 8 is to lis ten to the tape and do it the hard way*\n( Incidentally, the script which dealt with Japanese Art and had two\ninterviewees was one of the best. Mrs. Elise Grilli, noted art\ncritic of the Japan Times, and Mr. Yoshinobu Masuda practicing artist\nof considerable fame.\nTherefore, ray suggestion is this: if a scfipt is absolutely necessary,\nwe can do it this way. Right now I haven't got the time. If anyone\non your staff lias the time and patience to transcribe the thing, fine.\nOtherwise, I suggest we let the script go,\nI ftope you got Tape No, 8, I'm trying to cook up a good show on\nmusic, and this is harder than I thought. But I'll get at it soon, and\nhave it in your hands. By the way, am I to think of a total of ljL or\n13 programs I\nCordially yours.\na\n>hn H Lerch"
