  "text": "- 13 -\nk. Use of SAG or AFTRA Talent\nAs you know, SAG and AFTRA need notification whenever member talent\nis used for public service spots. Both have agreed to accept notification\nby wire instead of the usual letter when time is short. Just in case any\nspots have been made without SAG or AFTRA notification when appropriate,\nprotection can be assured by sending a memo to the organizations involved,\nlisting performers, media and length of spots. Both SAG and AFTRA are\ncooperating completely in the Youth Opportunity program, and have\nmentioned this to us for protection of their members as well as those of\nus making spots.\nDan Seymour"
