Skornia\nFrom: Burton Paulu\nHere is the latest revision of my travel schedule, so\nfar as it involves NAEB.\nI have decided to postpone my departure for Rome in\norder to attend the EBU meeting on commercial television in\nLondon, May 21-23. I shall sign in as representing NAEB,\nwhich I assume will be okay with you.\nIn order to attend this meeting, I therefore am delaying\nmy departure for the EBU meeting on radio in Rome on May 27\nthrough 31, and shall go by air instead of driving, as I had\noriginally Intended. This involves slightly greater cost to\nme, although it will not make any difference to NAEB, since\nI am paying my own transportation to Rome (charging NAEB only\nfor living costs once I arrive.)\nI received the radio documentation from Harold Hill, and\nsent it on to EBU headquarters to be copied. I also got Leo\nBogart s The Age of Television from the University of\nMinnesota Library, and shall take it along too, since it\ncontains much material about the effects of television on\nradio listening. (That’s really long distance service for\nyou: a man living in London borrows a book from a library\nin Minneapolis to take to a meeting in Rome!)\nBy the way, did anybody ever represent us at the\nInternational Music Council in Paris? I shall check with\nEvarts about plans for the August meeting in Salzburg on\nOpera and Ballet in Television and Film.” At the moment,\nit looks as though I shall not be tied up then.\nBP:ds"
