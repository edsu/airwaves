A.* Hardly a building escaped. Again\nand again one saw a youngster scratch, with chalk* ”3cusa, Poroo,\nse tl chiaiaa Tito” — excuse it, pig, if someone calls you Tito.”\nOften they would add ***** caricatures of Tito swinging on gallows.\nOne easily concluded that Marshal Tito and General Winterton would\nnot get very many votes in Rome. But the Americans weren*t getting\nmany at the moment, either.\nOn the crowd went to the Piazza Venezia, where Mussolini used to\nharangue students, along with others, from hie balcony# And there\nthese students were harangued by a couple of the political heirs of\nII Dues.\nOne shouldnH overstate the case. The demonstration had its\nlighter aspects. Obviously, some of the kids were just celebrating\nthe delicious prospect of no school on a lovely autumn day.\nAt one point an automobile carrying the sultry Italian motion\npicture actress, Sllvana Pampanini, got involved with the crowd* And\nsome Italian youths forgot for the moment about Trieste to whistle and\ncrowd around the car and ask Signorlna Pampanini for her autograph.\nAnd I saw one wall where some teen-ager had scrawled ”d«ath to Tito,”\nbut had added, just below it, a chalked heart and the legend, ”Blanca\nis my love!” Some of the students were laughing and joking as they\nraced along toward the Piazza Venezia.\nYet, there was fanaticism on many of those young faces; faces\nof boys and girls who would have been only two or three years old\nwhen Mussolini took Italy into World War II."
