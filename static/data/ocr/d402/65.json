In order to accept this, you must accept a looseness in definitions\nunder which the word \"profession,” as used here, applies not only to the established and\ndefined professions of teacher, physician, engineer, and lawyer, but also to newer pro¬\nfessions such as social worker and scientist, and even to still undefined professions, such\nas the management of men, the management of money, or the management of opinion, as well as\nall of the recognized auxiliary professions, such as accountancy, public administrator,\nlibrarian and pharmacy, and the innumerable semi-professions that support them*\nThe task of staffing professions is not, of course, a new one for higher education*\nIt has been a role for systems and programs of higher education in all countries from the\ntime of the first establishment of universities. It was, to a considerable extent, the task\nof our system of higher education at the turn of the century*\nHad we continued that system without change to the present day, we would presumably have\nample supplies of natural scientists, of humanists, of practitioners in health fields, and of\nlawyers, and some, but inadequate, supplies of engineers and social scientists* But we would\nbe almost without any supplies of college-trained school teachers, businessmen, government\nservants, home economists, architects, journalists, librarians and social workers* Further¬\nmore, there would be no opportunities for college training in nursing, or medical technology,\nor secretarial fields* Preparation for these professions and semi-professions accounted\nfor less than 10% of the activity of higher education in 1900* Today, it accounts for\nh&%} if we judge on the basis of statistics, and more than %0%3 if we judge from our own\nknowledge and experience*\nThe fact that half of the activity of higher education today is devoted to activities\nthat were barely, or not at all, considered a part of higher education in 1900 establishes,\nI think, a social trend that will probably control the developments with which we must deal*\nThe trend is a difficult one to characterize in a phrase, but essentially it is a\ntendency for professions to proliferate, or in the modern financial phrase, to spin off\nauxiliary professions and semi-professions* It is also accompanied by a tendency for the\nprofessional man, whether he is a manager or a doctor, or a lawyer, to move himself into a\nspecially prepared working place, to surround himself with professional or semi-professional\nassistants, and, relying on communication and transportation, to transmit his decisions, to\nmultiply his work accomplishment and his influence*\nThe prime example of this is today the doctor who in fifty years has moved his place\nof practice from the patient's home to the hospital, where he is surrounded by all manner\nof professional and semi-professional assistants and colleagues and supported by a huge\nmedical manufacturing industry for supplies and equipment* $ut this is only one example*\nWe have created a totally new professidn of scientist and have set him up on a basis\ncomparable to that of the doctor in both industry and government. The engineers are now\nin process of doing much the same thing at the planning and sometimes the administrative\nlevels *\nProbably this trend would be best described as an institutionalization of our pro¬\nfessions, but if we so describe it, we must be careful to note that it is a trend that is\nstill developing, and that its ultimate development is closely related to the development\nof higher education*"
