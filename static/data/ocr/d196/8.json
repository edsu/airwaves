Moreover, the casualties\nof the resistance included 19,000 civilians and 35*000 soldiers and officers, who died\nprisoners.\nThe significance of the partisan guerilla movement can be assessed under three aspects!\nFirst, psychological. The partisans restored self-confidence and self-respect to the\ndemoralized nation, which went through a kind of new Hisorgimento, or resurrection, and\nsealed with here best citizens* blood her reaffirmation of human and liberal ideals.\nSecond, military. They gave a substantial contribution to the Allied victory in Italy\nand to the general war effort by pinning down 12 of the 32 German and Fascist Republican\ndivisions, thus enabling the Allied armies to divert large forces to other operational\ntheaters and, finally, preventing the Germans from organising their last stand in the Alpine\nredoubt.\nThird, political. The partisan movement provided an inspired new' leadership to postwar\nItaly. It exercised a decisive role in the repudiation of a Fascist-contaminated monarchy bjj\nthe Italian people; in the setting up of a democratic republic, and regaining for Italy a\nrespected place among the free nations of Europe.\n(FUflSOB It HASTHO JTOM33 QUATTEO).\nHOVEYi This year's orientation included lectures on contemporary Italian music, art\nand literature; one on the Italian press; and two on United States political and economic\npolioy in Italy.\nExtras included bus trips to nearby places of interest! Assisi, the city of St.\nFrancis; Siena, Orvieto, Areas®. Fulbrighters attended the famous sacred music festival,\nheld annually in Perugia.\nInevitably, the whole experience had its impact. Americans learned that one can sur¬\nvive without a daily hot bath. They had to, because Perugia's old aqueduct was ailing and\nthe water supply was short. They soon forgot about peeling Italian grapes, and decided it\nwas safe to eat those wonderful Italian cheeses5 Bel Passe, Gorgonsolam Mozzarella.\nAmericana who hadn't walked for pleasure in years got the habit of taking the autumn air\nalong with Peruginians in early evening along the Corso, blocked off for that purpose. Some\nof the Fulbrighters made great strides with the Italian language.\nIt was a good bet that most of the hundred-odd Americans would be sorry to have orienta¬\ntion month at Perugia come to an end.\nSome would have a genuine impact on the I+alian scene. One ex-Fulbrighter, Professor\nFrank M. Snowden of Howard university in Washington, had recently returned to Italy to be\ncultural attache at the United States embassy in Home.\nPianist Alao Manoinelli of Steubenville, Ohio, v/ho played a concert for fellow Ful¬\nbrighters and Paruginians during 1953 orientation, was soloist with Bone's Santa Cecilia\nsymphony orchestra this Ootober, after winning Italy's covoted Busoni prize.\nFulbright singers who also performed at Perugia lest year won high praise for their\nwork in Puccini's \"Madame Butterfly\" in the 1954 autumn opera season at Spoleto. Critics\ncalled a Chicago soprano, Edith Lang, one of the season's discoveries.\nA 24-year-old Pittsburgh conductor and 1952 Fulbrighter, Lorin Haazol, directed\nFlorence's Maggie Musicals orchestra in its first broadoast concert of the fall season.\nAnd so it probably would be with some 1954 Fulbrighters."
