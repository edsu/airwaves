Japan strikes one as an amalgam of old and new,\nof the poet Lafcadio Hearn and big business, of cherry\nblossoms and strict financial regulations.\nThe most remarkable single fact about postwar Japan is the\ndegree of success with which an additional fifteen million\npeople are being provided for — somehow and with no unemploy¬\nment crisis — with exports still running well below prewar\nlevels. The next most remarkable fact is that, despite\nlow incomes, rising prices, and an acute shortage of housing\nand space, the country remains tranquil, and people reasonably\ncontented. Therefore, the notion's social problems differ\nwidely in nature and degree from those confronting wealthier\nWestern countries, and they must be solved in the Japanese\nLEECHj\nway.\nThis requires on our part, patience, understanding and\nperhaps, for good measure, a few grains of Oriental fatalism.\n(r&USE)\nIn concluding our introductory report, I'd like to call\nattention to some reading material that should prove valuable.\n7\nTwo highly informative bibliographies both written by Dr. Hyman\nKublin of Brooklyn College offer the most informative list\nof books, articles, and references to Japan that I have seen.\nOne booket; WK&T SH/iLL I RELD ON JiilfiN published by the\nJapan Society of New York ranges over the field of geography,\nreligion, literature, history, and economics all on Japan.\nThe second bibliography put out in a short pamphlet entitled\nI&GES ON £SIA, A Citizen's Reading Guide, is publisned oy\nthe University of Delaware Extension Division, Newark,\n( 6 )"
