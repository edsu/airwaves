Y.\nAugust 28, 1952\nMr. Graydon Ausmus\nVice-President, NAEB\nBox 2002\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Graydon:\nThis Executive Director is becoming quite a\nproblem.\nFirst, some general observations on the two level\nmatter:\nI think it improbable that we could interest or\nafford to pay such a ”top level, high-caliber man with\nan established national reputation1’. The government has\na difficult time attracting and holding such men even at\nthe salary it pays. The type of man you*re talking about\nwouldn't look at the job for less than $20,000 a year,\nunless he were retired and just wanted to do a job for a\ngroup he believed in.\nI think we had better be practical about this. Can\nwe afford to even think of such a man? It means taking\nmoney from the current operating budget and might mean\nmortgaging our future. It is questionable in my mind\nwhether we would get returns commesurate with what we\nwould have to pay.\nYour second category, it seems to me, is as low as\nthe first is high. A younger man, yes - but an experienced\neducational broadcaster. We can afford to pay enough here\nto get a top man. Some have already been mentioned. Bill\nHarley, for example. I also feel you would be putting a\ngood man under a humiliating handicap if there was a lot\nof rearranging of the duties and responsibilities of the\nExecutive Director just because a younger man was coming\nin. Somewhat closer supervision for a while, certainly,\nbut to curtail powers and authority upon such a change\nwould sap a man's confidence and make undue trouble for\nboth the Board and Headquarters.\nI will not attempt to name anyone In the first\ncatagory. In the second category, I'm still for Bill\nHarley, first and Irving Merrill, second.\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
