Schooley /j\nRe:\nRadio Grants-in-Aid\nfor 1955-56o\nPresident Harry Newburn, of the Center* has advised Skornia\nthat the Center Board of Directors has authorized placing in the\nCenter budget the sum of $42*000* to carry on the Grant-in-Aid\nprogram. This amount would include $2*000 overhead designed to\ntake care of NAEB?s expenses and administrative costs.\nThe letter contains the following paragraph:\nfTThe Board of Directors made one suggestion with which our staff\nconcurs. They felt that there should be some design* plan or\npossibly theme operating in the assignment of these grants\nand directing in some measure the general nature of the content\nfor which such support will be given. It is necessary, thereÂ¬\nfore* for me to suggest that in connection with planning for\nthe grants this year procedures be developed to insure that\nsome such pattern is made available. This* the Board felt*\nwould tend to place some limitations upon the nature of the\nprogram content for which the Center would make grants on\nthe recommendation of the NAEB and thus concentrate a little\nmore about some significant program needs in the offering.\nWhile the Center has no desire to dictate the nature of this\npattern, we do wish to encourage its development\nI recommend approval"
