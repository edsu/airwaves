Hudson\nProgram Co-ordinator\nEducational Television and Radio Center\n1610 Washtenaw Avenue\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Bob:\nDo you or anyone at the Center have any estimate on\nthe quality of the DeToequeville scripts? I don't want\nthis to be a formal evaluation but rather an indication\nof whether our planning committee should consider seriously\nthe production problems of this series. The Center was\ngood enough to give us copies of the script and then we\nloaned them on an urgent call of FAE, so I never have\nactually had a chance to 3ee then.\nSincerely,\nFES:cu\nFrank B. Schooley\nPresident"
