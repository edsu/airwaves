C. 20036\nDear Mr. HUI:\nIn response to Betty's request for suggestions as to what a yearbook might\ncontain, I submit the following.\nA yearbook should be a reference book, self-revising every year, carrying\nlists, data, names, etc. which alter from year to year. I don't think it\nshould contain a great deal of material such as the NAEB constitution\nwhich is not at least in part, new and different. Ideally, it should con¬\nstitute a complete and up to the year reference on the educational broad¬\ncasting and the instructional television field. It should also, if possible,\nincorporate information pertinent to the field of professional broadcast¬\ning education.\n1 am looking through the H.E. W. publication \"Educational Teleguide\" and\nit seems to me that an up to date reference on all such material would be\nmost useful. Taking the contents of Educational Teleguide in order, I\nwould suggest as follows:\nPage 1 -- Non-commercial reservations. Very useful. There\nare suffide nt additions, deletions, drop-ins, etc. each year to\nmerit reproducing the entire list. It can be condensed in space,\nof course. Changes since last year should be identified as new.\nPage 9-- New books--list only those which have appeared during\nthe year.\nPage 12 — Other publications. Ditto whatever has appeared\nduring the year.\nPage 16 — Organisation. Very important. Suggestion of adding\na brief description of each is good. Also add a short resume of\nimportant activities and progress during the year."
