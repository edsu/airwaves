When I talked\nabout a pre-test with youngsters in Toronto, I was thinking primarily\nof something which would help you get the feel for youngsters in this\nage group, the best ways to stretch their intellect, etc. I believe\nthat since you have not been concerned seriously before (as I have\nbeen led to believe - perhaps erroneously) with the teaching of high\nschool youngsters, you should try it in a face-to-face situation be¬\nfore going to tape so that you can get some rapid interaction going\nand learn more quickly what can be done with them. X was not even\nthinking in terms of testing them - either pre or post - but simply\nproviding you with some bases for the planning of your tape sessions*\nPerhaps my .use of the word \"pretest\" was misleading. Of course, you\ncould try to post-test them. X am not sure at this stage that any¬\nthing could be gained from an actual test of them beforehand. This\nis not because X believe that there is a high degree of homogeneity\namong llth grade youngsters in these attitudes and reactions. This\nis simply because X do not think that you are at the stage yet -\neither in the development of the course or the measuring instruments\n- that would make the formal pre-test and post-test useful. However,\nif you have something you want to try in the way of testing, you\nmight go ahead and try it on these initial groups.\nHoy Hall from Health, Education and Welfare will be in town today.\nAm interested to hear what he has to say.\nAm looking forward to receiving copies of your Media Log as they come\nout.\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Badio-Film\nSLB:ks\ncc: Harry Skomla"
