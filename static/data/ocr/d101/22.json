This contracts sharply with the $500.00 charged by\nthe National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), the association of commercial sta¬\ntions of the United States, for their management and other seminars. Considerable\nsubsidy of the sort included in this request seems inevitable if the NAEB is to help\nraise the local as well as national status and qualifications of educational broad¬\ncasters to the level of other employees of educational institutions, whose impor¬\ntance to the whole institution’s functions is recognised sufficiently to justify more\nexpenditure on the part of the institutions themselves for in-service training, con¬\nferences and related activities in this new field.\nAt present it is unfortunately true that many of the NAEB members who\nattend our conventions, workshops and regional meetings must do so wholly at\ntheir own personal expense • That they do so is a compliment to the enrichment\nwhich these meetings or seminars provide. However, in view of the resources\navailable to such individuals generally, it is also a stringent limiting factor in\nconsidering the possibility of complete self-support for such seminars and meetings\nat this time. It also provides dramatic contrast to the situation of extension editors\nand members of other departments of educational institutions which are older and\nmore firmly established or have access to federal or other funds • Vve believe that\nthis situation is natural to a new field, not yet fully defined or understood, and\nthat eventually, thanks to efforts of the sort we have outlined, this situation will\nbe greatly improved,"
