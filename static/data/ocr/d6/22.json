Many uni¬\nversities maintain educational broadcasting stations and some of\nthem also have university presses, which publish from time to time\nscholarly works of music and even musical compositions. Some of\nthem may do recordings. None of these things are popular or intended\nfor profit.\nMay I suggest that your subcommittee make sure that the bill\ndoes not work a hardship onion-profit scholarly publishing,organiza¬\ntions •\nAF dp\nbcc Harry Skornia<"
