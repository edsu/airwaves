One type of problem, for\nexample, is that which the corporation has actually created —\nsuch as air and water pollution. It is fair to say that most\ncorporations now understand that they have the primary responsi¬\nbility to clean up their own 'messes” — and to use natural resources\nin such a way as to maintain their value for others.\nThe opportunities for corporations to apply their resources\nto help solve broader social problems is less clear because, for\nthe most part, they have not been examined either imaginatively\nor systematically.\nLooked at this way, there is almost no social task to\nwhich some corporation could not make a significant contribution.\nThis is because our corporations have absolutely unique capabilities\nin research, technology, and managerial skills — and these are\nprecisely what is needed. If Aerojet General and North American\nAviation can apply systems analysis to pollution abatement and\npublic transportation for the State of California; if Litton and\nITT can run education and job-training camps for the Job Corps —\nwhy should not every corporation find an area of social improvement\nthat matches its capabilities."
