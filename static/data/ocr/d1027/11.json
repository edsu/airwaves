KtelloggFoundation\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nI think I told you some time ago, that the travel I’ve had to carsy\non was getting too such. I need tine to have a vacation and do\nthings with the kids before they are gone. Z had expected, when Z\ntook this 46b, that mined a might want m as a Professor. That time\nhas near con*. I’ve several times in the past turned down offers, be-\ncause MSB was on the threshold of something. I don’t think I can,\nthis time, and have notified our Board accordingly. A search Caaalttee\nvlll seek a successor.\nThe transfer of the Hetwocdc to the Center will he voted on at the\nOctober Convention, which will be ay last perfoomnee as President.\nZ think we’ll by then have a Washington office open — and manned. We\nwon’t have lavish funds, but should be able to “make it.\" Meanwhile\nweM like to continue to use Ktellogg funds for operation here, where\nwe move into two houses in July. In fact, Z think the future looks\nincreasingly promising — so it won’t be thou^rt I’m leaving because I’m\n\"ffed up.\" I had to decide on the Illinois Job here and now. Since it\naeons Z don’t need to move — a factor when there are children in school ~\nZ felt I should not pass it up.\nWill keep you isfemaed as various documents and develog^senfcs are available.\nMeanwhile, best wishes.\nSincerely,\nBarry J. Skomia\nPresident\nHJBsJl\nCC: Mr. William Barley"
