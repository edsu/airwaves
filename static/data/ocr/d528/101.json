Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Cindy:\nHope our \"date\" for Friday, the 23rd is still on. As plans\nstand now, I'll take an early plane down and be at your\noffice shortly after 9:00 a.m. I'm also going to try to get\nover to the FCC later in the day.\nWell, I've decided to stay here. I'm still not sure how\nhappy I am about this, but the combination of the good deal\nat Columbia and the possibilities of trouble with the WAMU\njob finally decided me. Living in New York for another\nyear will be a mixed blessing, but at least the decision is\nmade. I will probably continue to work part-time for the\nC£B, especially as Al Hulsen is to be the Director of Radio\nAffairs as of June 15.\nDid you talk with David? I am now extremely curious to see\nwho the university gets to run things. Hope it is somebody\nwho is a bit familiar with the politics of the situation.1\n•See you soon.\nSincerely,"
