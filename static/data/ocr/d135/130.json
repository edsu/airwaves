The white squares indicate seats\nvacated by students who preferred to receive the course on television during the\nfinal five weeks of the semester.\nThe proportions were almost identical in the second-class\nsequence of General Chemistry.\nBeginning about two weeks after the final free-choice day\ninterviews were conducted with samples of students drawn from\n(a) those who left from the rear of the auditorium, (b) those who\nremained in the rear, and (c) those who left from the front. These\ninterviews were conducted out of class on an individual basis by\nan experienced interviewer who endeavored to probe for reasons\nwhich determined the choices made by students.\nThe reasons given by students who chose to receive the instrucÂ¬\ntion by television were:\n1. They thought that they could see and hear better.\n2. There were fewer distractions.\n3. They claimed that their attention was directed by the TV\ncameras and screen to what they should see."
