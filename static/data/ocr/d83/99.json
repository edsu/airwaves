One will be in the nature of electronic\nmedia — or criticism (or standards for criticism). Need to start\na very simple, step-by-step syntax development. Others will\nInclude TV-radio for teachers? international broadcasting — and\npossibly others. I won’t try to teach any of these until the\nfollowing year of course. But for the first, the results of your\nproject will be essential foundation blocks — as will any materials\nyou can make available. 1*11 want to keep in touch with you through¬\nout, for perhaps some such will be useful in Canada, and the rest\nof the world. With more time, 1*11 really be able to try.\nFelt I had to take time to drop you this note. Awfully sorry for\nthe shabby way I've had to treat so many who deserve better.\nIt was nice to see your wife — bless heri All the finest to you\nall.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nPresident\nHJSsjl"
