The tense child, therefore, is not\nthe child who learns easily. For him, learning\nis a \"hard thing.\" To \"reach\" him, we must do\nseveral things, within the framework of education\nas he knows it:\n1) We have to create an environment in\nwhich learning can occur, and that he\nwill know about it.\n2) Those structures must be meaningful,\nnot humiliating or threatening to the\nindividual."
