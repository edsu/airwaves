I\nam sorry that it is so late but, after all of the discussion with\nmembers of the committee, 1 wanted to be sure that th$y saw a copy\nof it complete to be sure that I had not misinterpreted their feelings*\nThis is why it is on ditto* (I am assuming that headquarters makes\nany further copies that are needed*) The committee seems to be\nunanimous on all of the points made*\nThere is only one thing that bothers me a bit* Neither I, nor any\nmember of the committee, feels that the HcLuhan project should be\nscrapped* If you feel that this in any way implies that we do think\nso, I hope that you will explain this at the proper time and place -\nor feel free to make any adjustments in wording which would clarify\nthis*\nLooking forward to seeing you in Detroit* (Gads, you must be harried\nnowi)\nBest\nSamuel L* Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio~Film\nSLBlks\nEnel*"
