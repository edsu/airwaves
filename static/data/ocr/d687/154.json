However, I do have tapes of the talks\ngiven by Humphrey, Walker, and lyler, and also of the Thursday\nafternoon Siegel session arranged by Leonard Marks. I am sending\nthese to you under separate cover in order that you may refer to them\nin writing the report of the meetings and also so that you msy consider\nthem for offering on the KALB tape network if you so desire.\nI shall also dig up a few copies of the text of Walker*s talk\nso that you may refer to them.\nin regard to the new stationery which you referred to on page 2\nof your November lb letter to ;.raveon, may I suggest that you so\narrange the officers' names so as to include the secretary up with\nthe president, vice president, and treasurer? The implication of\nthe stationery we now use is that the secretary is not a full member\nof the official family which is not the case. So treat yourself to\nthe acclaim you deswerve and see that your position is put up st the\ntop as you deserve!\nBurton Paulu\nLnc. . \"Vice President\ncci Graydon Ausraus\nBPicjm\nP. S.
