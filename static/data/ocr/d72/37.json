Bell\nDirector\nBureau of Audiovisual Instruction\nStadium Building, university of Colorado\nBoulder, Colorado 80304\nDear Dick:\nThank you for sending along the article for the Journal.\nWe have an idea which we think would give greater circulation\nto your article, and especially to those to whom it is aimed -\nthe non-members.\nWe are thinking about printing it as a small brochure. In this\nway, several copies could be sent to each of our institutional\nmembers so that their staffs might see them. More important,\nwe could use it as a general mailing piece to enclose with all\nsorts of correspondence going out of here, especially to those\nwho write in and inquire about Individual membership.\nWe have really not had time to think over the matter thoroughly,\nso we will hold the article until we can consider it further.\nWhat are your thoughts about this? 1 felt that putting it in\nthe Journal would be akin to the preacher exhorting his congre-\ngation to attend church.\nCordially,\nHarold Â£. Hill\nVice President\nHBH/mlm"
