Becker, Director\nDivision of TV, Radio, Film\nState University of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nAs you can see, there have been some changes made. I left Wayne\nlast month and am now trying to adjust myself to a new environment.\nI should like to attend the meeting of the NAEB Research Committee\non 24 October 1961, but I simply can't get away for a trip to Washington.\nYou may be sure that I sincerely regret that I can not be with you.\nE.T.S.C. is a delightful place. There are twenty-six people on\nthe departmental staff, and all appear to be amiable as well as competent.\nWe have a new building, excellent facilities and 5100 students. What more\ncould I ask?\nI am working on a Radio-TV development program and hope to make rapid\nprogress. I'll keep you informed of our progress.\nEllen and I have just moved our crew into our new home. We built\na Cape Cod house on a half acre of land just two miles from my office.\nIt is a delightful place.\nDo let me know what transpires at your meeting.\nCordially,\nJBE:lb\n>hn Bj\nLairmi\nEllery"
