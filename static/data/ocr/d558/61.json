I am satisfied that Overton\nmeans well and I have no reason to believe that he wouldn’t\nbreak through the ice.\nEvidently, even in the music field the whole problem is wide\nopen. I know Clair Meader too but of course would go to\nPetrillo first. I guess hia closest contact is in the\nmotion picture field but I cannot understand what he means\nby WI suppose the general theory that Brewer’s hostility\ncould do us a great deal of liarm in the film world.® T am\nsure he is referring to Roy Brewer-who is a friend of mine—\nbut if it is a personal opposition, he is no longer with IATSE.\nAnyhow, it is pretty obvious that very little has been done\nin the entire field, and that there is room for a general\npolicy.•.\nSincerely,\nMSNSS"
