Because, if you people will not oppose an organization\nwhich desperately wishes to destroy your radio network, your\norganizational base of membership and your prestige with\nindustry and foundations (and which has never hidden these\naims and has already attained some of them) then I cannot\nhelp you. If Hull wants to preach \"Exodus‚Äù again and follow\nthrough this time you can count on me also. But if you are\ndetermined to (1) surrender your organizational base - the\nstations, (2) surrender your radio network - or let it become\nimpotent and (3) go bankrupt - then I must decline to fight\nfor the NAEB alone.\nSincerely.\nJohn C. Schwarzwalder\nGeneral Manager\ncc: Mr. Richard Hull\nMr. Jim Miles\nMr. Ray Hurlbert\nMr. Leonard Marks"
