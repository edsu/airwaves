If the applicant desires to take advantage of the\nprovisions of the suggested Section then he should be required to submit data\nshowing that no encumbrances to array operation have developed within two miles\nof the antenna site. The final criteria should be the validity of the antenna\nradiation in pertinent directions. If a complete proof should be necessary\nfor the establishment of an up to date radiation pattern then it should be\nrequired.\nSection 9(3)b\n<}A skeleton proof of performance (a minimum of 3 field\nintensity measurements including the monitoring point\nreading on each radial) on the directional antenna\nsystem if no complete proof of performance has~been\nsubmitted to the Commission within 2 years from the\ndate of application for remote controlT”\nIt is suggested that if no complete proof of performance has been\nfiled within three years prior to submission of the application for remote\ncontrol and the desirability of complete proof is not indicated by any of the\nprovisions made under Section 9(3)a a skeleton proof of performance be filed.\nA minimum of five field strength measurements including the monitoring location,\nif any, should be made on each radial. Such radial measurements should be\ncompared graphically with the last complete radial data submitted in the prior\ncomplete proof of performance and if good correlation with the effective field factor\nat one mile does not obtain them a complete radial should be run in any such\ndirection. A minimum of five measurements on each radial rather than three\nwill insure a more adequate basis of comparison.\nAffiant has no comments with respect to Conelrad factors and\n- 7 -"
