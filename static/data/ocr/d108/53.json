  "text": "ANNGRs\nHere is some background information prior to the discussion\n;\nwith Mr. Chew. Despite many attempts to place the Japanese\nlanguage in a category with others, nothing really certain is\nknown abort its origins. Japanese still troubles linguistic\nscientists—and it has no clear connection with any known\nlanguage except Luchan—spoken on the Ryukyu Islands.\nBy far, the greatest influence on the language has come from\nthe Chinese- a language so dissimilar to early Japanese that\nthe modern speech is an almost unbelievably complicated\nsynthesis of the two. The unit of Chinese thought is an\ninvariable monosyllable--and represented in writing by a\nsymbol, variously known as a 11 character”, ” ideograph” or\na ,,log§^graph”f In the fifth century A.D. the Japanese\nadapted the Chinese logo-graph system of writing to their\nlanguage-- ideally suited to phonetic transcription. The\nresultant confusion is the modern Japanese language- a mixture\nof oil and water as it were.\nBy the ninth century, a phonetic syllabary was invented known\nas the kana. The kana character is a greatly abbreviated form\nof a Chinese character, used phonetically. The syllabary\nconsists of 47 phonetic symbols to stand for the number of\nsyllables into which Japanese has been analyzed. But the\nkana syllabary has not replaced the logographic method\nentirely5 it is rather, a compromise device to bridge the\ngrammatical gap between the two languages. Modern Japanese\nis a combination of Chinese and native words used in a\nis a comparatively simple language phonetically. As for\nsyntax, the word order of Japanese resembles Latin; subject-\ndirect ob2 act —verb.\nOne of the questions asked by students of the language is\nwhy isn't the language simplified? And this leads us right\ninto our talk with Mr, Chew.\n-3-"
