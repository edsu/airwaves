J, Skornia,\nExecutive Director,\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters,\nUniversity of Illinois,\n119 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, Illinois,\nSanavni 0V3H 83VN\n03AI3D3>j\nDear Mr, Skornia:\n* cl ° 4\n/PR!\n'sWrr\nS'\n<v v\nten***\n~ih\nIn reply to your request for a copy of CBC Halif ax-\nDartmouth studies, I have pleasure in enclosing one copy each of\nthe two reports entitled \"CBC Halif ax-Dartmouth Study: Part One -\nRadio Listening Patterns in a Canadian Community .,, \"Before\"\nTelevision\" and \"CBC Halif ax-Dartmouth Study - 2nd Report - Study\nof a Canadian Community Before Television\". The former study\n(Part I) is now practically out of print.\nI am certainly glad to hear that you wish to in¬\nclude the material in your Fact Sheet surveys. Your assumption\nabout the confidential classification is correct, and normally\nour reports are meant for internal circulation in the CBC, There\nis also the complication of mention by name of several non-CBC\nstations. Further, as you are no doubt aware, survey companies\nare chary about the reproduction of their statistics which are\nsupplied for the specific use of subscribing members.\nHowever, if you could avoid identification of par¬\nticular stations and use any highlights from these reports for your\nFact Sheet we shall be only too glad.\nI shall be grateful.if you can send us a copy of\nthe Fact Sheet in which the material is used.\nYours sincerely.\nDr. B. K. Byram\nSupervisor of Analysis and Reports,\nAudience Research Division"
