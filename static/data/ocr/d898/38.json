C. 20036\nDear John:\nWe do not know what plans may have been made for publication of the\nradio study that has been undertaken by Samuel Holt, but on the\nchance that a decision has not been made, NAEB would like to serve\nas the publisher of the full report.\nOur staff feels that a special issue of the Educational Broadcasting\nReview would be especially appropriate. The EBR goes regularly to\nnearly 3,000 individuals in educational broadcasting, to all the\neducational television and radio stations, to over 400 libraries,\nto a large number of Washington-based associations and organizations,\nand to many departments and agencies of the federal government.\nUnder Mr. Holt’s general editorship, we should be pleased to use\nthe Educational Broadcasting Review as the central distribution\neffort, with additional copies made available to any beyond the\nregular subscribers who may wish to have them.\nInasmuch as the report has not yet been put into final draft, we\ndo not know what the exact printing costs would be. Our present\nissues, which number approximately 72 pages are printed and distri¬\nbuted for about $4,000.\nIf I can provide any additional information about the EBR, or, if\nyou feel some other format would be suitable, we will be pleased\nto discuss this further.\nSincerely,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGHsbb\ncc: Mr. Fred W. Friendly\nc . /2vU?uJUL^ & , /2"
