  "text": "3\nSTATEMENT OF PROGRAM ACCEPTANCE STANDARDS\nThe following statement is intended as a guide in the selection of pro¬\ngrams for use by the Tape Network. Obviously few programs can meet all the\nstandards listed below; some programs excellently suited for the Tape Network may\nmeet only a few of them.\nThe Network as now constituted is to. a large extent an outgrowth of the\nfirst Allerton House Radio Seminar of 19U9; therefore, it is fitting that the\ncommittees should accept the basic educational programming principles determined\nat that meeting. As phrased by Robert B. Hudson, \"The Allerton seminar asserted\nthat the aims of educational broadcasting are the broad aims of education:\n\"...education in a democracy has the responsibility of lifting the\nlevel of understanding and appreciation of the people, of giving\nthe individual a knowledge of himself and his society, and of the\ntensions and perplexities in each;\n\"...in a free society it is essential that the individual have a\ncontinuing sense of belonging and participating, of keeping up\nwith a complex and fast-moving world;\n\"...it is the responsibility of education to foster and further that\nfeeling of belonging and counting.\"1/\nThe committees further agree that programs chosen for the Tape Network\nshould meet certain minimum standards as to: (1) network suitability; (2)\nengineering standards; (3) audience appeal; (k) subject matter; and (5) presen¬\ntation o\n1. Network Suitability. The programs distributed should be of wide¬\nspread interest and should be selected to supplement the program\nresources of individual stations.\n2. Engineering Standards. The engineering s tandards of the programs\ndistributed shall conform to the standard ) drawn up by the NAEB\nTaps Network Engineering Advisory Committee.\n3. Audience Appeal. The programs should ax.tract and hold their\nintended audiences.\nlu Subject Matter. The programs « again in Hudson1s words - should be\n\"distinguished by...high concern for integrity in the selection...\nof materials, and by...consistent dedication to social purpose.\"\nSubject matter chosen should have the effect of:\n\"(1) infoming,\n\"(2) stimulating the individual to organize and give meaning to\ninformation,\n17 Sohert B.
