He would like to work out a program\nand I think I can help him.\nX made it very clear to him that I was not trying to propose a program of operations.\nHe understood and appreciated our efforts. After forty minutes X had a pretty\ngood idea of what he wants and 1 think he benef ited fay some of my ideas and the\nexperiences of some of the others which X recounted to him.
