The fact is dramatized with a true\nlife story that is heart-warming and inspiring. It is\nthe story of Tom and Agnes Carvel, who began\ntheir married life and joint business career selling\nfrozen custard at a carnival. The hard knocks en¬\ncountered and the stubborn courage of this young\ncouple makes this a typically American success\nstory. Gradually Tom and Agnes built their auto¬\ntrailer custard stand into a multi-million-dollar\nbusiness, giving employment to hundreds and\nstimulating the growth of a whole new industry.\nAn excellent cast makes this a very human story,\nchallenging the initiative of all free people.\nLeft (above); An ambitious couple finds that cold weather some¬\ntimes can be a barrier to sales; and (below) a single nickel may\nbe worth its weight in gold in times of stress. Right: fifteen of\ntheir first 21 freezers have had to be repossessed; the future\nlooks dark."
