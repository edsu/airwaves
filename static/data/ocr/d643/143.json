I found him extremely friendly (about\nthe take off on a three week winter vacation) and quite caimed\ndown. I told him as the minutes became available to the member*\nship in published form I was sure he would agree that a great\ndeal of action had been taken. I get the impression that he\nwill continue to stay in the fold.\nIneidently, he did mention that he got a letter of conÂ¬\ngratulations from John Dunn welcoming him outside the select\ncircle.\nSineerely.\nTelevision\nand KJON-TV\nJ:n\ncc: Harry Skornia"
