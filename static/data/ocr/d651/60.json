Burdick\nManaging Director, WHYY\n1622 Chestnut Street\nPhiladelphia 3, Pa.\nDear Dick:\nI have your copy of your June 1 letter to Bill Harley and seem to read some\nirritation with my statement to Hartford about my contacting some other tele-\nvision members other than Board members. That letter to Hartford was com¬\nmenting, in the part referred to, as of the television director of Region II\nto which I also have a separate responsibility. Opinions from Region II\nmembers were important to me and for that reason I did contact certain of\nthem. I would not have felt free to contact members in other regions in such\nmatters when their own directors have that responsibility.\nYou probably know that I was in agreement with referring the matter of program\nproduction to the television membership. Even though the full Board has suf¬\nficient authority to decide the matter in such a case, I felt it more democratic\nto poll the membership, particularly so when there was such a real difference\nof opinion. However, unless and until we change our organizational structure,\nwe need to support the association as it is now set up to operate.\nI write to seek your understanding for I, too, see our weaknesses. I regret\nthat you took out after me without knowing the circumstances. This business\nof trying to conduct business by correspondence is poor at best. I assure you\nthat, as Chairman of the TV Board, I will try to administer it as best I can and\nwelcome your assistance which is much needed and appreciated. If you feel\nthat those receiving copies of your letter might have been influenced by your\ndirection of thinking, as far as my handling of the matter is concerned, you\nmight also feel that you should set them straight.\nSincerely yours,\nRaymond D. Hurlbert\nRDH/ml Chairman, TV Board\ncc: Mr. William G. Harley"
