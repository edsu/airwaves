Consequently I cam© away from the\nmeeting with a vague impression of charges against\nTom that might have some validity in which funds\nand dependability were involved. Subsequently\nX received a copy of Tom’s letter, which I am sure\nwas directed to other members of the nominating\ncommittee.\nI was deeply concerned because of my long acquaint¬\nance with Tom and the total absence in previous\ncontacts of any question of either his intelli¬\ngence or ability. Consequently it seemed to me\nadvisable to inquire first hand of one of his\nlieutenants daring the period of unusual stress\nthrough which he has gone during the past year.\nR. C. Norris, formerly was of his staff, has\nJoined m here at W3C has prepared the anlosed\nstatenant at ay suggest’ on.\nI am reasonably certain that it is not clearly\nappropriate to suggest a reopening of negotiations\nslnc*i progress is being made towards securing a\ncandidate on whoa we are all in agreement, namely\nKarl *¥ynn. -^ut I do want to do what 1 can to\nraise a general fog of doubt about Ton since Norris*\nfull verbal explanation to me has convinced me that\nTom is the victim of clrcumstances in which his\nprinciple fault has boon in a too soft approach\nto unfounded attack. I a.: sure that some of you\nwill recognize my personal memories of a similar\nexperience of my own in which *1 found many people\nrefusing to \"offer such a position to meMafter the\ncouncil folded in Chicago. There were also many\nof my friends aware of the fact that 1 had gone\nthrough emotionally trying conditions. I believe\nthat same of them worried whether I would be able\nto deliver fully.\nRepresenting non commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
