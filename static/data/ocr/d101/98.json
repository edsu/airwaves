Richard 0* Forsythe\nProducer\nPurdue University\nStation WBAA\nLafayette, Indiana\nDear Mr* Forsythe;\nI find it difficult to react to the research proposal which you mentioned\nuntil it is defined a bit further* If the focus is to be simply the\nmean and range of qualifications and background of personnel presently\nemployed, I am not sure what value your study would have* We know that\nthere are many incompetents presently employed in our stations* There\nwill probably always be but there are undoubtedly a greater number now\nas we are developing and trying to find out what kind of people we need\nand as we wait for them to be trained* If these incompetents are\naveraged in with everyone else, what will your data mean? I would think,\non the other hand, if you combine some sort of rating system of each\nemployee with the information on background and training, you will have\nthe data to break down your sample and try to arrive at some answers as\nto the critical background factors. Isn't that the important point?\nAnother point* I suspect that the key to the success or lack of success\nin educational television is more a matter of intellectual, personality,\nand values factors rather than the kinds of courses one has taken in\ncollege or the kinds of experiences which he has had* Are you planning\nsomething to take some of these factors into account? If not, I would\nthink that their consideration could enhance your study considerably*\nI do not know whether these are the sort of suggestions which you want*\nHowever, here they are for whatever they may be worth* I will be\ninterested in hearing of your progress*\nSincerely,\nSamuel L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLB:ks"
