C. 20554\nINF BULLETIN NO. 16 - B\nJune 1966\nEDUCATIONAL TELEVISION\nIn little more than a decade television has become an integral part of qual¬\nity education. It has brought into the classroom instructors, demonstrations and\nvisual and aural materials that have enhanced almost limitlessly students' learn¬\ning experiences. It has brought into the home cultural events and public affairs\nprograms heretofore available only to those relatively few who had the means and\nthe opportunities in a metropolitan area or academic complex where these materials\nwere accessible.\nThe first ETV station went on the air in May, 1953. Exactly thirteen years\nlater, in May, 1966, 115 educational television stations reached a population area\nof some 140 million persons, and it was estimated that some fifteen million\nstudents in more than two thousand educational institutions, including elementary,\nsecondary and higher education, were receiving all or part of their instruction\nthrough television. Sixty-four applications had been filed with the Federal\nCommunications Commission for 197 channels in the Instructional Television Fixed\nService (2500 megacycle band) since the service was established in 1963. Some\n1000 closed-circuit television systems were serving public and private education,\nindustry and various service agencies.\nInasmuch as the Federal Communications Commission does not license or regu¬\nlate wired closed-circuit instructional systems, this bulletin will be devoted to\neducational broadcast stations, translators, microwave systems, and the Instruc¬\ntional Television Fixed Service.\nThis Information Bulletin is reprinted by permission of the Federal Communica¬\ntions Commission. Copies of this Bulletin are available for distribution from\nthe Educational Broadcasting Branch, Federal Communications Commission,\nWashington, D. C. 20554.\nB-13"
