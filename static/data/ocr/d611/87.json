W.\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Ken: '•\nFirst, thank you for the very flattering comments about KDPS\nand especially our philosophy.\nSecond, I hope you can help me find a program about each of the ,\nfollowing: Stokley Charmichael, Rap Brown and Malcolm X.\nSpecifically, what we are seeking is a 15 minute in-school\nprogram on each to help round out the “Negro in America\" series\nproduced by WNYE.* Any ideas?\nThird, you may be interested to know that when our black\n“DJ\" Ezell Wiggins left for college last week, that we were\nhung for a replacement and finally were forced to announce\nthat \"Soul Session\" would be taken off the air. The next\nmorning I got a call from a young Negro asking if there was\nanything that could be done and indicating that he would like\nto \"give it a try\" because \"it is the only thing we have\" in\nDes Moines. He indicated that every young person he had talked\nto in his community liked and listened to the show and didn’t want\nit to go off, but didn't know what they could do to keep it on!\nWell, to make a long story short, thanks to the initiative of\none young person, many will keep \"the only thing\" they have.\nChuck Holloway is the young man's name - and I wish there were\nmore like him!\nBwignt E. Herbert\nRadio Director\nDEH:jc"
