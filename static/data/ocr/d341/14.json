With you, McBride,\nEager, Schwarzwalder and myself there is a good deal of TV manageÂ¬\nment represented on the Board; and, of course, Sehooley, Miles,\nand Ausmus are very much involved in television, too. Your election\nto the NAEB Board also provides another link to the Center via your\nmembership on the fund raising subcommittee of the Affiliates.\nSo I am sure you will add strength to our Board and I look\nforward to working with you in the Interests of NAEB,\nBest wishes for the holiday season.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:jc"
