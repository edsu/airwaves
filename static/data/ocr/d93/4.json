C.\nIN REPLY REFER TO:\nISP:CH\nMarch 1, 1951\nMr. Richard Rider\nNetwork Coordinator\nDepartment of Radio\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Richard Rider:\nHere is the situation with regard to rebroadcasting\nby non-commercial stations of the atomic energy\nseries \"The New World of Atomic Energy,\" the eleven-\nprogram series which began on WLS Friday, February 9\nand is being broadcast weekly on their \"School Time.\"\nYou will note from copies of the enclosed letters that\nAFM has given blanket approval for re-use but that\nAFRA will require specific request from prospective\nusers.\nWe are bowing out of the picture at this point and\nleave further negotiations up to those interested and\nthe Office of Education. Gertrude Broderick says\nhowever that thereâ€™s no reason why NAEB members have\nto cone through her office so you can deal direct\nwith WLS and AFRA.\nOf course, all of us are indebted to the original\ndecision of WLS to make the entire series available\nfor rebroadcast, subject only to union clearances\nand a WLS credit.\nI have not heard any of the broadcasts so far but\nall reports I received indicate that it is one of\nthe best educational projects in the atomic energy\nfield that has been attempted to date. WLS is\nworking closely with the AEC's Argonne National\nLaboratory at Chico which reviews the scripts for\ntechnical accuracy."
