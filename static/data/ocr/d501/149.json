However, I am able to give\nyou all the information, on our proposed series, available now.\nSubject to your approval of our plan and pilot tape we should like\nto record thirteen quarter-hour programs on weather for release to\nthe NAEB tape network.\nWe intend to record the programs as follows. We will record a series\nof lectures by distinguished personnel of the Air Weather Service in\nthe classroom at the University of Maryland. We will produce the\nopening and closing portions of the program in our professional studios\nin Washington. These openings and closings will be worded to meet\nyour specifications.\nI am enclosing a brief biographical sketch of our announcer and myÂ¬\nself (I shall produce the series) for your perusal. I am also enclosing\na list of the thirteen speakers and their subjects for your consideration.\nI believe that they will cover the weather field most adequately. These\nlectures are expected to commence around the first of February and we\ncan get the master tape to you within a week following each recording.\nI mention this so that you may make your plans accordingly.\nIf you will need more detailed information at any time, please feel\nfree to contact me.\nChief, Radio-TV Branch\nOffice Information Services"
