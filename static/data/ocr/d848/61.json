Though the recovery of gold from all this vast amount of\nwater now seems hopeless, we may have some help from the ocean itself. She\nreaches down and picks up a lobster. Cobalt is even scarcer than gold, she\nsays, but this clever fellow manages to extract it. So perhaps in some not-\ntoo-far-off day, we may be able to select marine plants or animals which can do\nour mining for us.\nBut, she says, that won’t be necessary in every case. If you could look\nalong vast bottom areas of the ocean, you would see something that looks like\nthis. We see on the ocean floor mock-ups of manganese nodules. No, says the\nteacher, there aren’t burned potatoes. They are mysteriously-formed nodules\ncontaining manganese, iron, and small quantities of cobalt, nickel, and copper\n...strewn along the ocean floor. There they are...just waiting to be scooped\nup...more mineral wealth than the human race has mined in all its history. How\nwill they be scooped up? That remains to be seen. But one nodule collector,\nproposed by oceanographer John L. Mero, looks like this. We dissolve to a\ncut-out representation of the Mero nodule collector. Aside from the propellers,\ngyros, and floats to keep the pipe positioned in the deep, deep water...and the\ntelevision cameras to find nodules.. .what does it remind you of? That’s right.\nOur old friend••.the useless vacuum cleaner.\nWhich is not so useless after all, is it?...asks the teacher, when the\nprinciples on which it operates are adapted to the specialized demands of this\nnew environment. And the vacuum cleaner, changed up in another way, is being\nused also to harvest fish on fish farms.\nTeacher says she would like to have a fish farm. ..IF it weren’t for the\n\"weeds\" eating up all the food. Does that sound strange? Well, she says,"
