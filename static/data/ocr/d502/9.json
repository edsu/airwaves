I don’t know whether this is always\nthe best procedure or not. that would you say to the idea of us trying to call\nrepresentatives of the locals together at one meeting, indicate to them that this\nstation is a comaunity project, non-ccssaereial, educational, and that wo need\ntheir cooperation to help make it a success.\nAny suggestions that you can make will be appreciated, and anything that\nyou can do on the national level with HAEB, JCET and the unions themselves to try\nto iron the matter out would certainly clarify the picture not only in St. Louis\nhut also in other parts of the country. The one thing to keep in mind, however,\nis the possibility that any national union arrangements might thereby impose\nunion situations on localities normally free from them.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nRichard J.
