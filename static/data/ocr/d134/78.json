Skomia\nExecutive Director\nNAEB\nIk Gregoiy Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nCongratulations on getting the \"Understanding Media\"\nproposal through I Hope that your meeting with Stone\nwent well. Sorry that I did not write earlier - I was\nout of town for a week and a half and just returned.\nIf you and/or Marshall feel that a smaller group than\nthe entire Research Committee of the NAEB should be used\nas consultants on the project - what about making Ken\nHarwood chairman of such a sub-committee? He is as\nbright and knowledgable as anyone else on the committee\nand will probably do a more conscientious job than\nanyone else. I would think that Richard Evans could also\nmake some important contributions. I am not sure that\nI could make a substantial contribution (though I think\nthat I could) but I would also like to participate.\nIf you people think that three is too small a group,\nBruce Westley would be my next choice, then Merrill,\nSmythe, Ellery, and Kumata - in that oljder. I put Heide\nlast not because I think that he is least able â€” far from\nit - but because I think that he has least time that he can\nor would KX3sks devote to the project.\nAnyway, let me know when you people decide how large a\ngroup you want - and -what you think of the above suggestions -\nand I will write the group.\nBy the way, I will be leaving here about June 6th - thus\nany correspondence from early June on should be directed to\nme at the old address in Iowa City.\nBest\nSamuel L. Becker"
