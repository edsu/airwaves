Skornia\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dr. Skornia: *\nThank you for you letter. I have the feeling there is a large\nhut unorganized underground of Joyceophiles in the country—\nI too have kept most of my friends, if not on the edge of their\nchairs, certainly slouched down in them half-asleep, by readings\nand quotations from Joyce. The man lends himself to this sort\nof allegiance. Northrop Frye, Mr. McLuhan's colleague at To¬\nronto, draws on Joyce a great deal for his critical theories.\nI have accepted a six-months enlistment in the Air Force be¬\nginning 11 September, and will be in San Antonio, Texas for\nmost of that time: could you send me Mr. McLuhan’s address\nso that I might keep in touch with him as my address changes?\nYour project, and his work, interest me very much—the prob¬\nlems of mass media were one of the reasons I took a job with\nNewsweek, and I hope to enter graduate school at Toronto as\nsoon as I can practically do so.\nAttitudes toward time—their study—has been a longstanding\ninterest 6f mine. It is one idea which unifies, at least for\nthis century, a number of separate problems.\nAgain, thank you for your letter and your interest. I would\nlike to be of whatever help I can, and will remain in contact\nwith you.\nSincerely,\nRichard Rhodes\nM A G A Z\nN E\nO F\nNEWS\nSIGNIFICANCE"
