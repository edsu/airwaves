Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNat•1* Ass'n. of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\nUirbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nA copy of our letter to Frank Schooley is enclosed. You will\nnote from this letter that we are not able to approve the special\nprojects which were discussed when you and Frank visited us.\nI am, therefore, approving your request to include in your 1957-58\nbudget $6,000 for seminars instead of the $3,000 item as originally\nproposed. Thus, you will have in your 1957-5$ budget, which I am\nno* approving, a total of $16,000 for seminars, travel and research,\na total of $54,394 for the entire budget, a payment from our Founda¬\ntion of $50,294, and other income to be secured by your organization\nof $4,100.\nSincerely and with best wishes.\n, Maurice F. Seay\nMFS/fh\ncc - Mr. Frank Schooley\nP.S. - This action whereby your 1957-58 payment from the Foundation is\nincreased does not increase the total commitment of the Foundation to\nthe NAEB."
