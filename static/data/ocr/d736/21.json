Eleven foreign language\nmagazines are sent to exile groups in 52 countries.\n4. EXILE RELATIONS\nClose association with the political and intellectual\nleaders who have escaped through the Iron Curtain is\nfundamental to the Committee’s efforts. These men\nstand as symbols of hope and encouragement to their\nenslaved countrymen. Cooperation with them is the\nprime task of the Division of Exile Relations, seeking\nto promote political unity within various exile organ¬\nizations and, above all, to help them develop a dy¬\nnamic, progressive platform of aims and principles.\nTo advance this effort National Councils or Com¬\nmittees have been formed, composed of political lead¬\ners of dignity and stature capable of marshalling the\nforces of the emigration against the common enemy.\nRecognizing the right of the captive peoples ultimately\nto select their own leaders, these groups do not purport\nto be “governments in exile.” Rather, their mission is\nto develop a balanced ideological program to help the\nCommittee speed the day when democracy can be\nrestored to their homelands.\nWith the help of this division 200 exiled leaders of\nten Communist countries recently framed a document\nof historic importance. The “Declaration of the Aims\nand Principles of the Central and Eastern European\nPeoples,” signed February 11, 1951 at Independence\nHall, Philadelphia, represents a ringing challenge to\nSoviet imperialism.\nAnother example of exile statesmen acting in con¬\ncert occurred at Williamsburg, Virginia, on June 12,\n1952. On this anniversary of the signing of the Vir¬\nginia Bill of Rights, the exiles reaffirmed their dedica¬\ntion to the principles of individual liberty proclaimed\nhere in 1776."
