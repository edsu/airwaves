It\nwas licensed to operate primarily as a commercial station, but at this\nwriting it is devoting its entire program schedule to in-school and edu¬\ncational broadcasting in cooperation with Mecklenburg County Public\nSchools. This program service is expected to continue and perhaps\nincrease. The schools are picking up the in-school and general programs\noriginating at Channel 4 in Chapel Hill, and in addition are producing\nlocal programs to meet specific needs.\nThe State Department of Public Instruction in North Carolina issued\na statement that says:\n\"As is true throughout the country, Carolina is faced with\nan exploding school population. Numerous steps are being\ntaken to provide quality education for this tremendous\nincrease in students. Instructional television has proved\nitself in North Carolina as a teaching tool and increased\nuse is necessary to help meet the increased needs of educa¬\ntion. Recommendations have been made by the State Board of\nEducation to strengthen and increase the present use of\ninstructional television in the public schools, and to\nexpand broadcast facilities.

The\nevidence suggests that, in addition to two VHF channels in the eastern\npart of the state, a total of 27 additional UHF channels be made avail¬\nable to North Carolina, for purposes of instructional and educational\ntelevision.\nNORTH DAKOTA\nNorth Dakota is a large, very sparsely populated state. There are\nno major population centers in North Dakota. The two largest areas,\nFargo and Grand Forks, are in the extreme eastern part of the state on\nthe Minnesota border. The size of the state and the sparsity of its\npopulation present a particular problem in the equal distribution of\neducational opportunities and facilities. In the public schools scattered\nin the small towns and the rural areas throughout the state are 130,000\nstudents.
