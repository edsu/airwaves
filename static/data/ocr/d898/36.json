Programming is the back¬\nbone of educational radio broadcasting and our plan is to increase\nthe quality of programs being produced — and to make a modest in¬\ncrease in the hours of program service available to NER stations.\nWe expect to acquire some programs by direct purchase. Several\npossibilities are currently being studied. We expect to develop\ncertain programs or series by determining the needs and desires of\nthe station program directors — then commissioning the pro¬\nduction staffs of member stations to create the programs and\nseries.\nNERN does not have the staff or the production facilities to\nprepare programs — therefore, we will assign this task to others\n— perhaps someday we will have the people and the fcfcectronic\ntools to create, develop, produce and distribute programs."
