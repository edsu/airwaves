Hull, Executive Director\nWOSU TELEVISION\n2470 North Star Road\nColumbus 21, Ohio\nAugust 27, 1962\nMr. Hardd Hill\nVice President\nN.A.E.B.\n1346 Connecticut Ave., N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Harold:\n1*m getting in a bind on dates and times — down to the hour, it looks\nlike, in a couple of cases. Can you give me as much detail as you have\non starting and stopping times at the NAEB annual meeting in Philadelphia?\nFor instance, I know that the session opens Sunday, October 21 with a\n12:45 - 2:45 p.m. session for directors and constituents followed by a\nboard meeting. In the event I have to shave things at the end of the\nsession, give me the dope on the last two days - banquet time, and ending\ntime on October 24th. Will appreciate this much.\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hul1\nRBH:rc\nP. Incidentally, one of the things Ray Hurlbert and I were discussing\ns. after Bill came to our dinner (and you were occupied fully for a\nmoment with Bill), was the matter of who the ranking director might be\nin a given region with both Radio and TV directors. For instance, because\nhe is senior to me in III, l let Jim Miles take the lead in general\nregional activity. Ray Hurlbert and Leonard Presse work together. This\nis not to suggest that I do not work with Jim (witness his excellent\nRegion III meeting this spring in which we cooperated), but I have not\npushed the TV boys in III. While this may represent a deficiency the\nthing possibly does need some thinking through and spelling out. Ray*s\nextraordinary activity in II brings the problem to focus.\nTeaching Aids Laboratory •\nRBH\n'-ik&cO 7^/pujL+tA, ' J\nOffice of Seminars and Workshops • Ohio School of the Air • Video Recording\n±\n- /ix <\n• WOSU— WOSU-FM— WO.\nWOSU-TV • Closed Circuit TV"
