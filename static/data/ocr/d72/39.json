The ETV program was divided into university sta¬\ntion programing, school station programing, state ETV net¬\nworks, and new government projects and ETV financing.\nIn his banquet address, NAEB President William G.

The first steps\nare to investigate the needs and media potential and to esti¬\nmate the stations and interconnection required, with costs, for\nsuch a system.\nTo explore this further, a steering committee, represent¬\ning radio and TV, was set up, with John Young (director of\nTV, WUNC-TV) as chairman. The committee met during\nthe convention and will meet again May 7 in Atlanta.\nSome 160 persons registered for the conference in Wil¬\nliamsburg, Virginia, March 19-21. John Young was confer¬\nence chairman, and co-hosts were the College of William and\nMary and Colonial Williamsburg.\nJohn Whisman’s banquet speech inspired -much of the\ndiscussion about the Appalachian communications system. He\nis executive secretary of the President’s Appalachian Region\nCommission and assistant for area development to the Ken¬\ntucky governor.\nIn his keynote address, Harold Essex (president and gen¬\neral manager, commercial WSJS-TV, Winston-Salem) talked\nabout the responsibilities that go with rights. He said that if\nthe broadcaster is not to be interfered with or regulated, he\nhas to substitute self-regulation; he must impose upon him¬\nself standards of taste and concern for the public interest.\nThe implication for the noncommercial broadcaster was that\nhe has an obligation to do a good, sound professional pie'ce-\nof work whenever he takes to the airwaves. Sloppy produc¬\ntion and inept performances do not add up to respectable\nbroadcasting.\nMemphis will host next year’s meeting, with the Memphis\nCommunity TV Foundation and Memphis State University as\ncosponsors. Howard Holst, WKNO-TV, will be chairman.\nRegion II members also established an executive com¬\nmittee for the region. It is composed of the NAEB regional\ndirectors for the divisions (with one person internally elected\nto represent TV stations if one of the national TV Board\nmembers is not from Region II) plus the host for the sub¬\nsequent year’s regional convention. Thus the executive com¬\nmittee currently consists of the regional directors for radio,\ninstruction, and individual members—plus Holt Riddleberger,\nof WEDU-TV, Tampa, and Howard Holst. The executive\ncommittee will elect its own chairman.\nNAEB Newsletter, a monthly publication issued by the Na¬\ntional Association of Educational Broadcasters, 119 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana, III. 61803. $5.00 a year.
