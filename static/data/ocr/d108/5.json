However, we do have brochures giving summary\nbackground on the interviewees and the subjects discussed\nin 40 of the 65 programs* Copies are enclosed*\nThe Milton Mayer series was, on the whole, quite well re¬\nceived. Personally, I am inclined to believe that, with\nour rapidly developing international-consciousness, so to\nspeak, the series which you outlined for us would be well\nreceived. If I remember correctly, one part of each pro¬\ngram, or of some of the programs, was to be devoted books\nbearing on the European scene* i feel a bit sceptical of\nthe success of this idea. We are not, on the whole, a na¬\ntion of book-readers, and I’m afraid that the effect might\nbe that of second-hand information where the program should\nstrive for a sense of immediacy.\nOr do I remember correctly?\nI am sorry I can offer nothing more constructive, but, if\nwe can be of help in the future, please call on us.\nSincerely,\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager\nJHicp\nEnel."
