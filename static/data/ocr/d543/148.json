Skornle,\nExecutive Director,NAEB\n14 Gregory HaH,\nUrbana, Illinois.\nDeer Harry:\nThis Is to report that I am back In Erst Lansing and on the\nJob once more, we returned late Thursday evening, tired\nend glad tc be home again. we had a very pleasant vacetlon\nand enjoyed every minute of It. The only difficulty Is still\nthat, regardless of retlremsnt, the work plies up. I hope\nto be somewhat caught up by this time next week.\nI yesterday answered a letter from John Dunn and completed\nthe notarization of the clelm for dues. I trust that the\nmoney will come along scon. In his better John says:\n\"I em addressing this letter to you since I presume you are\nstill Treasurer of \"ALP. That shows, you how little I have\nkept up with the gcln-cn of the organization since I bowed\nout.\n\"Much against my will, our board was persuaded by a third\nparty to resume its affiliation with NAEB. Personally, I\ndeem it *2C0. wasted money for I think that NAEE, as It Is\nnow constitute!, is an Ineffectual organization.\n\" \"Therefore, bowing tc the Instructions of my board, I am\nenclosing a set of claim, blanks which you will please use\nin making claim against the CLTA for *COC.OO. Please note\nthat the claim nust b^ properly signed and notarized, neturn\nthe claim to me for processing.\nI my answer I dl! not mention his comments re NAEE except to\nsay that I feel that under hurley everything Is moving In a\nvery businesslike manner and that under the new Kellogg grant\nthe funds would be handled by NAEP instead of thb university.\nMy comment to you is that I feel an Inconsistency in the\nabove underlined statements.\nRegarding WNYCs They have paid their 1955 dues but not the\n1959 billing. This Is unusual since the 1958 dues were paid\nby Feb. 1st. Is there any serious reaction since the International\nFrogram committee appointment?"
