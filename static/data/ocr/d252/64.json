Tell us something about your job, Gomi.\nEnglish newscast in Japan.\nPart cf your training cane in the United States, did it not?\nIn particular at Ohio State University.\nYou’ve bean with MTV since 1953. Right on the ground\nfloor—\nI'd like veiy much to have you explain Japanese television\ntoday. Something of its history, who operates the stations,\nthe program structure, and so on.\nIt was not until after Vi or Id Ear II... that regular television\nbroadcasting began in Japan. TV has since captured the\npublic interest, and Japan is now in the midst of a television\nboom.\nBroadcasting systems for both radio and TV are unique. Before\ntho war, radio broadcasting in Japan was similar to that\nof Groat Britain. Tho Japanese counterpart of the BBC, the\nJapan Broadcasting Corporation (Nippon Hose Kyokai—NHK),\nowned and operated all radio stations. However, the postwar\nyears have seen the development of a mixed or dual system\nin which both government and privately owned companies are\naro in radio and TV.\nks one who has seen and hoard radio end TV abroad, I believe\nthat programs in countrios where broadcasting is a govern¬\nment monopoly tend to be dull and stereotyped while in countries\nwhere broadcasting is entirely in commercial hands, advertizing\nis often toe insistent and detracts from tho interest of the\nprograms.\nIn this respect, I believe the dual system wc have in\nJapan has its special merits."
