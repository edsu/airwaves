So life is pretty hard for the Skupins,\nbut it has been much harder for them in the past and It wouldn*t\nbe quite as easy as It Is now if some people in America had not\nthought of trying to bring the seeds of life and construction to\nthose parts of the world where they are most needed* An occasional\nletter still comes to the office of architect Odd Nansen in the\ncity of Oslo, addressed simply: Nansen, Norway. Odd Nansen*s\nfather, Fridtjof Nansen, the Professor of Oceanography who invented\nthe Nansen Passport, received thousands and thousands of such\nletters* Architect Odd Nansen himself is considerably more famous\nas a humanitarian than he is as an architect* He has worked all\nlife for refugees, and he is President of the Norwegian section\nof the World Movement for World Government*"
