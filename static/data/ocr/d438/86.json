Narrator might quote from Siepmann ( TV AND OUR\nSCHOOL CRISIS, Chapters, page 41):\n\"Experiments hove already gone far enoggh for the less adventurous\nto follow In the footsteps of the pioneers, profiting from their mis¬\nadventures and availing ourselves of their discoveries. It is high time\nto substitute for *a reconnaissance in depth' a general advance, in this\nas in other directions, along the whole educational front.\n\"Let us then retrace the steps of the pioneers . . their means of\ntransportation • . the direction of their advance, and the points\nreconnoitered.\"\nNarrator parking a tiny footprint at the State University of Iowa, at Iowa State\nCollege (Ames), and at Philadelphia • . . without mentioning the names of the places)\nexplains that the earliest and (then) the only means of transportation used by instruc¬\ntional television was that of the commercial channels. This was clearly unsatisfactory\nover the long haul, as education all too frequently drew the bock seat in choices\nbetween profit and public service, and educators and educational broadcasters began\nto press for transportation all their own. When, in 1952, the Federal Communications\nCommission established a new rxition-wide television allocation plan, and reserved\n242 channels (now increased to 267) for exclusive noncommercial educational use by\nschools, colleges, universities, and nonprofit educational television corporations,\nqsecial stations began to be built.\nThe first of these noncommercial educational television stations to go on the air\nwas KUHT in Houston, Texas, in 1953."
