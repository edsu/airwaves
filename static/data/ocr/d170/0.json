I feel\nthat it is an absolute necessity for Headquarters to employ\nnot more than two program specialists at this time. Within\n18 months it may become necessary to add additional specia¬\nlists. I would advise moving slowly in the employment of a\ngreat number of such specialists in the beginning. Let us\nget two good people and move upward from there.\nAs I mentioned yesterday, I believe it would be a\nmistake to add either part-time or full-time regional tele¬\nvision programming or operational specialists at this time.\nA better system, it seems to me, would be to make available\na group of top men in the regions on a consultant basis\nand to set up a Headquarters Fund for this purpose. At\npresent I doubt that we could find more than two top pro¬\ngramming specialists who would come to us either on full¬\ntime or half-time basis. We can find many good.programming\npeople in all of the regions, who would be willing to work\non a consultant basis and, I feel, quite regularly. If we\nare looking for top talent, I believe the consultant system\nin the regions will be best. I believe that Headquarters\npersonnel should be offered not less than $> 8,000, perhaps\nmore. Again,we are looking for the best talent we can find."
