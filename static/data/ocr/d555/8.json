The acting\nwas fine and the script above average. Too often\nprogram making a plea for racial and religious\ntolerance end up with a long and dull collection of\npious platitudes. I was a little surprised to find\nsuch wide tolerance among the members of a single\nfraternity house but otherwise the program was quite\ncreditable. I was also impressed with the point of\nview which did not claim that the problem was solved.\nCertainly there is still much to be done. I vote\n“yes“•\nGood luck to you, John, in New York"
