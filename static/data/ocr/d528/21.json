B. CARLISLE, Director, Program Development\nLet me call your attention to two enclosures having to do with the upcoming Career\nFellowship Seminar at the Hotel Warwick. One item is a rough copy of the schedule\nof events for the three-day period; please note that there have been minor changes\nas to who speaks when. Should any of these changes pose a major problem for you,\nwould you be kind enough to call me with modest dispatch?\nA second item is the insert for the latest CPB Newsletter, describing in picture and\ntext the Career Fellows themselves. This may be helpful in grooming your approach\nto them. Regrettably, we have no picture from East Lansing of Mr. Merlos: He was\na last-minute substitution because NBC Washington hired away our candidate from\nWETA.\nMay I urge you again to give the Career Fellows opportunity to put questions to you.\nWe consider that discussion is a very important aspect of this Seminar.\n/ef\nEnds\n1250 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036, Phone: 202-223-2228/9"
