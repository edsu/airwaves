But the newspaper is actually\nsuch a dally epic as Raskin describes, though he would have\nbeen embarrassed to hear iti\n'fence it is an infinite good to mankind when there is\nfull acceptance of the grotesque, slightly sketched or\nexpressed; and, if field for such expression be frankly\ngranted, an enormous mass of intellectual power is\nturned to everlasting use, which, in this present cen¬\ntury of ours, evaporates in street gibing or vain\nrevelling; all the good wit and satire expiring in daily\ntalk, (like foam on wine,) which in the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries had a permitted and useful expires—\nslon In the arts of sculpture and. Illumination, like\nfoam fixed Into chalcedony.\"\nThe nineteenth century drive towards gothic, Raskin explains,\nas it were, was to get away from fixed, private points-of-\nview back to group dynamic expression, back to the field and\nthe folk. Of course, there was much self-deception in all\nthis. But, at least, the Romantics strove to revive a period\nof culture which preceded perspective. And to this extent\nGothic was truly avant garde, Just as is Chinase art in our\ntime.\nThe newspaper mosaic is a collectively achieved photo of the\nworld and its inter-associations, hour by hour. To teach\n”“e understanding of what such a medium Is, and what it does\nto our association with ourselves and with one another, can\ns°aJ®ely achieved by notioing the ownership, or policy,\nof the paper. Even Its contents, item by item, are not much"
