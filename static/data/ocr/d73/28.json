Only last month, simplified tape recorders,\nselling for roughly half the price of standard commercial broadcast equipment,\nwere introduced, and there will be further technical advances and further\neconomies in this equipment field. The new units already make control\nof originating facilities financially feasible even for moderate-size educational\ninstitutions."
