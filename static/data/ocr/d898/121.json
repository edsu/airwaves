  "text": "8.\nAt the Suffern, New York Conference in October, 1968, the\nthesis was advanced that key stations in a model network would\nbe required to mdse a total commitment to the network broadcast\nschedule. It was pointed out that many colleges and university\nstations are well established and provide a viable program\nservice. Certainly, the Wisconsin State Network is so engaged.\nIt is difficult to see how it could participate in the model\nwithout abrogating its current local and state responsibilities.\nNonetheless, it is desirable that the model be tested in a\nnon-urban environment since nearly half of all Americans live\nin small cities, small towns and rural areas. The cliche that\n70% are urban rests on the antiquated and misleading assumption\nthat any town of 2500 or over is \"urban\". Correcting this to\nmake 50,000 or over the urban base, together with the immed¬\niate suburbs, we find that 46.5% of our population is really\nrural.* (If the 1965 population figures are corrected for\nthis base, there are 88 million rural Americans.)\nA better test might'be made by the five stations licensed to\neducational institutions in the state of Utah. The market\nsizes, types of licensee and isolation factors are present to\nmake Utah a significant test area.\nBased on Professor Harold Wolman's article in the Oct¬\nober, 1968, COMMONWEAL."
