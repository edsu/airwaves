Burrows,\nChairman\nNAEB Network Acceptance Committee\nRadio Station WUOM\nAdministration Building\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Ed,\nRe H. Hill*s memo of June I!}., 1962, I can see no\nparticular objection to changing the quarterly offerings\nto a December-February, March-May, June-August, September-\nNovember basis if it will help the in-school stations*\nSince, however, this would create some bookkeeping\nproblemsâ€”what with the new-found point system and the\nJuly-June fiscal year most of us operate on, etc. -~I\nfeel it should not be done strictly on the say-so of\nJohn Finster of old South Bend* I would suggest a poll\nof the school stations to make sure that this is what\nthey want*\nIt probably is* By an odd coincidence one of the\nemployees of Pat Swenson*s KBPS in Portland was in my\noffice when Hill*s memo arrived. He was bitching about\nthe fact that they reopen in September but the quarterly\nNAEB offering doesn't start until October,\nI do feel, however, that the in-school affiliates should\nbe consulted before any change is made. I offer this as\npart of a general Harrison campaign to make the network an\naffiliate-oriented rather than general NAEB-oriented\noperation* I understand that one of the current plans\nbeing kicked around by Harley and the board involves\nincorporating a separate network operation outside of\nNAEB* If this take place I feel it is imperative that\nthe new organization be answerable to the affiliates,\nwith a board elected by affiliates, etc. etc.\nSo, what else is new?"
