Paragraph two again\nputs stress on kinescope operations as insisted on earlier, though\nI have a relaxation of this insistence in a letter from Mr, Griffiths,\nfollowing discussions with him. It is the tinderstanding that this\nengineer win be available for general TV operations problems, inÂ¬\ncluding kinescope work, and that he will also not completely Ignore\nradio needs.\nWould you please forward suggested work for him to start on, and\nlist places where you think he might be particularly needed, so\nsome priority may be established, please?"
