I m asking John Dunn to come to this\nmeeting because ho hag always maintained an independent attitude where many\nof us are inclined to be swayed by the thinkii^ of the other people* John\nalso represents th© thinking of a large segment of this organisation more\nfully than any of the others of us «• not a brake, but a ballast.\nThrough the courageous, intelligent, and imaginative leadership\nof Dick Hull and his close associates during the years when ho was president"
