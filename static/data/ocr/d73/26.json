It would be one of the most prudent investments we, as a\nnation, could make, because it would offer our best hope â€” and surely our\nmost realistic one -- for achieving a substantial upgrading of educational\nquality on a short-run basis and at a cost we could afford.\nThis $2-1/2 billion investment would buy:\nAnother 150 ETV stations giving us a nation-wide educational\nnetwork comparable to our nation-wide commercial\nnetworks. Approximate Cost: $100 million.\nBranching closed-circuit systems for all schools in the\nUnited States. Approximate Cost: $900 million.\nStudios and television tape centers for originating programs\nfor these closed-circuit systems. Approximate Cost: $900 million.\nTelevision receivers for our million-and-a-quarter classrooms.\nApproximate Cost: $600 million.\nWhat could be accomplished, educationally, with facilities of\nthis magnitude? We could meet our three most imperative needs in educational\ntelevision today.\nFirst, we could forge a stronger union of the teaching, broadcasting\nand graphic arts."
