SIEGEL\nWNYC, Municipal Broadcasting System\n2500 Municipal Building\nNew York 7, N. Y.\nFebruary 29, 1952\nMr. Seymour Siegel\nWNYC\nNew York City, N.Y.\nDear Si:\nThank you for your latter of February 25 concerning the meeting\nof the Board at Columbus. The first general session of the Institute\nis at 8:00 P.M. on Thursday. Do you think that the NAEB Board can\ncomplete all of the necessary business from 9*00 Thursday morning\nuntil six that same day or should we ask the Board to meet Wednesday\nevening with the Executive Committee meeting perhaps Wednesday at\n2:00 P.M.?\nSince several of the committee chairmen which you appointed at\nthe Gotham meeting are planning special sessions with their respective\ncommittees coincidental with the Institute, would it not be wise to\ncommunicate with these chairmen as soon as possible requesting that\nthey keep all day Thursday free for a full meeting of the Board and\nperhaps designating Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday evening for\nspecific time for meeting of committees9 If we ask for a meeting of\nthe Board Thursday morning or Wedneday evening, can NAEB pay a portion\nof the expenses that will be incurred?\nPerhaps all of these are questions we can thrash out at the\nExecutive Committee meeting in Norman. However, the matter of a\nspecific meeting time of the Board should be set right away and members\nof the Board notified of it so they will not arrange conflicting\ncommittee meetings. If you agree with me on this, perhaps it would\nbe a good idea for you to write members of the Board setting up the\nmeeting date. If you prefer, I will write them but I don't want to\ndo so without your approval.\nThanks for getting the Morton matter straightened out. I think\nDallas has been a little pre-mature in his communications on the\nsubject but it is a good trait to have ideas formulated ai d get things\nrolling. The boy is a fireball and will work well with Morton.\nDIRECTOR OF STUDIES\nDALLAS W. SMYTHE\nIllinois University Communica¬\ntions Research Institute.\nUrbana, Illinois\nI shall be happy to serve as chairman of this committee and\nwill keep in mind our conversation of a more inclusive stucfy of NAEB\nstudies in conversations with Morton.\nSECRETARY AND\nPUBLICATIONS EDITOR\nBURTON PAULU\nKUOM, U. of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nKeep the old fightin1 spirit high. Will look forward to hearing\nfrom you.\nGA/ns\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations,\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies.\nSincerely,\n4Z<3S-\nivorkshops, and production"
