Siegel\nKadio Station WNYC\n2500 Municipal Gilding\nNew York 7, New York\nDear Sys\nI can’t really think of anything to add to the Prix Italia\nagenda draft. I would guess that items which occur to you in the\nframe of discussion can be taken up under \"Sundry.” And I think I\nsent you ray informal reactions and suggestions on the TV Documenta¬\nries.\nSchooley’s comment: \"I have nothing to suggest.” So I\nguess it’s all yours. Thanks for your thoughtfulness in letting us\nsee.\nHope you get to go, yourself. If not, your briefing of\nBernie will have to be enlarged, I’d guess.\nOur best. We’ll look for your note on the entries for this\nyear. Certainly glad you’re able to handle these.\nBest regards from all at this end,\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nEnclosure: Prix Italia Agenda draft (returned)"
