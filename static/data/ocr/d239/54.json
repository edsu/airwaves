Sometime during this year\nI trust we will have a chance to renew the\nacquaintance.\nMeantime, I want to send this note to\nthank you for your telegram of yesterday,\nand for your pronpt action in setting the\nRockefeller project in motion. I have\nmade contact with Frank Schooley, and I\nbelieve we are underway without complica¬\ntions. The project will be an interesting\nexperiment, and if we get somewhere with\nit in these six months — as I think we may\nfairly hope — it should lead to greater\nthings.\nSincere regards,\nMr. Graydon Ausmus\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nBox 2002\nUniversity, Alabama"
