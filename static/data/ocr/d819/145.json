I am a nominated member of the Council of that bocfy and at the\nmoment I am really acting as broker for the Hon. Secretary, Mr. Patrick\nSaul, in view of the talks I had with the Fund for Adult Education\nwhilst I was in the United States last year. I have informed Mr. Saul\nof the contents of your letter and I am sure that he will be delighted\nto have an opportunity of discussing the project with Mr. Ausmus next\nmonth if it is at all possible. Mr. Daul*s address is:- 36, Hedcliffe\nUlose, Sid Brompton Hoad, London, S.W.£, and Mr. Ausmus can make contact\nwith him direct or through me at this address as is most convenient to\nhim. I shall be out of London over the weekend July 10th - 12th\ninclusive but shall be available otherwise during the period of Mr.\nAusmus*s visit. But 1 will, in any case, suggest to Mr. Saul that in\nview of the correspondence that has now passed, he may like to write\ndirectly to Mr. ^usmus.\nI am very interested to know of the probability of a visit by a\nFulbright scholar to be concerned with the problem of liaison between\neducational broadcasters in the U.S.A. and the B.B.C. and I hope that\nI sh$ll have an opportunity of meeting whoever is chosen to do this\ninteresting job. We have been pretty closely in touch with the experi¬\nmental work on which the new further educational policy of the B.B.C.\nhas recently been established.\nYours sincerely,\n/s/ E.M.Hutchinson\nSecretary.\nBurton Paulu, £*sq..\nHe e-President,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\nKUOM, University of Minnesota,\nMinneapolis Ik, Minn."
