Direct U.S. aid to the Ryukyuans\nhas dropped from a $50 million flood in 1949 to a $500,000\ntrickle last year.\nMirroring this prosperity is the rebuild capital city of\nNaha. In 1945 this was nothing but a pile of smouldering\nrubble. Today it is a bustling community whose main street;\nis lined with modern department stores, theaters and office\nbuildings.\nWhere has this prosperity come from? It has come'mostly from\n’’invisible export’’--services. Services sold to the U.S,\nmilitary. THE IMPORTANCE of this ’’export” in the economy\ncan be seen by comparing the amount of money earned by\nselling services with the amount earned by actual physical\nexports.\nIn 1951 Okinawa sold nothing on the world market. In 1954\nexports were $7 million. In 1955 they jumped to $10 million.\nEstimated 1956 exports will hit $16 million.\nAt the same time, Okinawans will find a whopping $55 million\nin the pay envelopes they take home from U.S. ■■ Government\nsources this year. The services Okinawans render the UfS.\nhere are on all levels of skill. Okinawans work on construct\ntion projects, as technicians, as clerks, as translators,\nas administrators.\nThe significance of this can hardly bo estimated, because\nit seems sure that if Okinawa is to be self-sufficient in\nthe future it will have to continue its shift from agriculture\nto a service and technological economy.\nMUSIC__THEMEJJP AND OUT\nLEMCHs It is really too bad we’re not on television now, for seated\nacross from me is AIKO KITAOKA a beautiful young model and\ncostume designer. Miss Kitaoka, you have returned recently\n(5 )"
