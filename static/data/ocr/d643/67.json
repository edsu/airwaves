It’s worth thinking about, and\ndoing about If I or someone can come up with good idea.\nFor those who know I think the Newsletter and Journal\nin themselves are worth the price of admission, .“/here\nelse can anyone find out about what*8 going on. More\nImportant, there should be an Interest of the profes¬\nsional in the professional. But no matter what it\nought to be, how can we improve the situation. Maybe\nwe’ll have bright idea someday.\nSurprised Jerry Willsea didn’t mention all this to\nme because he and I have corresponded on memberships,\nand I spent all of one late evening and early morning\nwith him.\nRegards,\nFrank E.
