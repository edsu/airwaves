S. A.\nAttention Dr. Harold Hill.\nDear Sir: Re: Miss R, Nusbaum\nThis is to advise that Miss Nusbaum has retained\nthis firm for advice in connection with a salary dispute\noutlined in correspondence with you, which has been placed\nbefore me.\nWe have advised Miss Nusbaum that despite the fact\nthat the funds for this project have been depleted and\nexhausted, her legal right remains unaffected, and is to\nthe affect that her claims are valid and supportable.\nA contract was made at the outset of the project\nwhereby Miss Nusbaum was to have been paid $4700.00 for a\nfixed period. Subsequently she was advised that the salary\nwas to be $4500.00. At no time did she agree with this,\nbut rather did she protest to Professor McLuhan, who undertook\nto have the matter straightened out with you. She did not\ncommunicate with you directly, wishing to avoid the appearance\nof going over her principals head.\nThe contract envisaged payment in Canadian funds.\nWe therefore take the position that the deduction of exchange\nwas not authorized by the contract, and that Miss Nusbaum is\ntherefore entitled to the return of exchange deducted in\nthe amount of $209.69.\nThe law of this jurisdiction provides that an employee\nshall be paid 2% of salary in lieu of vacation. Miss Nusbaum\ntherefore has a valid claim against you in the amount of\n$94.00, being 2% of her salary for the period of employment.\nI have advised Miss Nusbaum that her claim for\novertime would be difficult, if not impossible, to support,\nand, without prejudice to her right to make claim should the\nmatter be taken further, we do not do so at this time."
