  "text": "-2-\n1) A definition of industrialization and the problems of reconciling it with\nthe ideals of democracy* The first results of industrialization are frequently\nto make people unequal, in view of the large sums of money required by corporations\nin a capitalistic system* Problems result from the creation of corporations at\none end of the scale and labor forces at the other with consequent divergence in\nincome and status.\nExplanation of the general meaning of industrialization to various aspects of\nour national life is needed here. This might be illustrated fay a program which might\nbe entitled ’’When Industry Gomes” to a city like Decatur, Illinois, for example, where\nthe results of a recent, rapid industrial expansion have been studied.\n2) The meaning of urbanization, together with problems of housing, and the\nmobility of population resulting from our present system would represent another\npotential general program. This mobility will be further discussed in various\nmeanings in a later section devoted to Labor.\n3) ’’The Role of the Farmer in an Industrial Society” would provide several\nprograms in this series, covering the meaning of industrialization in terms of the\ncotton farmer, the grain farmer, the dairy farmer, and the small fanner in other\nareas.\nThis section would have its point of departure in an historical section deal¬\ning with the early settlers and pioneers. Subsequent aspects would include the\nfirst efforts of the farmers to organize, the Grange, the ’’alliances,” the running\nof a presidential candidate fay the Populist party which was an effort at ”a farm\nparty.” Later sections would study other ways in which the farmer became a political\nand economic force, farm cooperatives, the Farm Bureau, replacement of farm labor\nby machinery, the depleting farm population, the big versus the little farmer, the\nowner and the tenant, farm science, and so forth."
