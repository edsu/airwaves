Seibert\nSenior Research Co-ordinator\nEducational Media Branch\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare\nOffice of Education\nWashington 25, D. C.\nDear Warren:\nIn order to respond to your letter of February 8, regarding future directions far\nour project with Marshall McLuhan, and in order to try to pull it all together,\nlet me get the budget down (it's attached separately, because of column\nwidths), and then let’s try to see how we can best work out what to do from\nnow on*\nOf the total grant we have received $30,000.00, the remaining $5,015.00\nbeing payable {subject to meeting all conditions) March 20*\nWith regard to the expenses, a final report will find these more exactly broken\ndown than shown here. (We have not so far been able to list telephone calls\nand telegrams separately, for example — under Communications. We’ve left\nthem, for this report, in ‘’Supplies,” etc.)\nSome items may be in transit. Marshall may have sane obligations for Ser¬\nvices (the $3,200) to the CBC, in Detroit, or with Dick Evans for videotape\nand production help. Ihere may be some rentals (of typewriters, etc.) also\nnot yet paid, etc. These totals are, therefore, subject to being changed —\nthere being a forwarding and payment lag •\nIf Marshall goes through with plans for some illustrative, drill and testable\nmaterials on videotape, tape, slides and film. I’d guess much of the $3,200\nmay be obligated *\nThe entire $2,000 for McLuhan*s assistant’s salary has been paid to the Uni¬\nversity of Toronto for his services for the whole period. Marshall and his\nsecretary are committed too, tor salary, through June 30.\nWe’ve been able to impose on the Research Committee members far one meeting"
