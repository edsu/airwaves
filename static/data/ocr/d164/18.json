He then opened a discussion of the role of\nassociate members of NAEB in the organization and in\nparticular changes in the Constitution and by-laws\nwhich would make associate members voting members.\nSkornia: Described the constitutional amendment which is\nbeing voted upon (at the time of the meeting) which, if\npassed would give associate members the vote. He opined\nthat the amendment would pass. He then brought up the\nquestion of why associate members were not able to sub¬\nscribe to the tape network programs for broadcast on\ncommercial stations.

The problem involves\nboth the music publishers and the musicians unions who\nhave been good about giving clearance for non-commercial\nstation use but would raise objections to commercial\nstation use even on a sustaining basis.\nSkornia said he has asked associate member committee per¬\nsonnel to go to work on the problem, to set up some pro¬\ncedure for determining which NAEB programs can be cleared\nfor commercial station use.

However, checking back on the union restrictions,\nif any, is almost impossible. The union problem involves\nboth restrictions by union people at the place where the\nprogram was made as well as at the place where it would be\nbroadcast.\nHe said, further, that it is not physically possible to keep\nold master tapes on file for more than about a year.
