Under\nthese circumstances I feel we are assessed too much for our various NAEB\naffiliations* We seem to be penalized for our 20 KW powerl I think that\nwattage is an unfair basis for assessment*\nAs you can see, the general NAEB offerings are very rarely practical\nfor our operation* Jeffersonian Heritage and American Adventure were all we\nused this year—and they were rather adult for classrooms*\nWe need the in-school programs—although we do not use many, picking\nand choosing very carefully* I want Newark to be affiliated with the best\nthinking in radio and television in the country—for the cause1 I feel\nmyself a part of NAEB,\nBut, our budget just got by this year after plenty of skirmishing*\nI wonder just how long I c$n recommend membership when the in-school character\nof our operation so limits our use of NAEB offerings.\nLet's get off the unfair wattage assessment and stress the element\nof usageI\nSincerely yours,\n/s/ Marie C* Scanlon\nMarie C, Scanlon\nSupervisor of Radio and Television"
