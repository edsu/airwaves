It ia very\ndifficult from this end to judge the nature of the trouble. Does it\nhinge on poor propagation conditions, which alas are all too frequent\non the North American beams, or has it to do with interference from\nother stations?\nI think we shall have to make a concerted effort to do away\nwith the difficulties, and there are three things which com© to mind.\nFirst I would like to suggest that we establish contact onoe every two\nweeks by means of tape-re cor d ings of the programme, made at your end\nand containing flashes of about 2*00n (speed inchos/soc) taken from\nthe various frequencies used for transmitting \"Nuropoan Review”. Play¬\ning back these tapes would give us a clear insight into the nature of\nthe trouble. Moreover, the tape can be used to let us know how many\nstand-by programmes you still have available.\nSecondly, complaints about the reception quality of the\nindividual frequencies might be best met by your employing a frequency\nmeter. The BC221 is a handy instrument, and it would make it possible\nfor you to localize free frequencies in the shortwave bands. You oould\nthen notify us of any free channels in the bands, on which frequencies\nare being disturbed. We ourselves are able, by means of our variable\nfrequency osoillators, to cover practically all the frequencies used\non the shortwave broadcasting bands. The current limiting factors will\nshortly be done away with. Does your equipment include a suitable fre¬\nquency meter?"
