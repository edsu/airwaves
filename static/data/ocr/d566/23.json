The committee\nis presently: George Probst, Jim Miles,and Robert Hudson. The\ncommittee has held one meeting. A second meeting has not been\nreouested in view of impending action by the foundations and\nthe current meeting of the board of directors of the NAEB. In\nlieu of a committee meeting copies of programs have been mailed\nto committee members for auditioning.\n. Such comment about programs as seems appropriate at this\ntime is reserved for a later portion of tnis report*\nTape Numbers and Tape Card File\nAll reels of tape have been given an NAEB number. The\nnumbers are typed on a small piece of cardboard and then scotch-\ntaped to a spoke of the reel. A card index is maintained by reel\nnumber, showing the location of the reel and what is on it. This\nprovides a reasonably accurate running inventory of the tape\nsupply.\nCue Sheets\nV;e have undertaken to send out cue sheets with all programs*\nThe cue sheets show, series number and name, program number and\ntitle, the order of playing by NAEB reel number, opening and\nclosing cues for each reel, and the times. We attempt to get\naccurate timings, but at present we have nothing better than\nMegnecordhs- or. -tfhdrch â€œto \"time* These machines do not time with\nabsolute accuracy. Hov;ever, except for possible errors, the\ntimes should be within workable limits*\n-12."
