Skornia\nExecutive Secretary\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nGregory Hall - U. of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nThanks for passing on the good news about the Florida ETV Commission1*\nfine recognition of Vernon Bronson. It will help to balance a set of\nscales which has been considerably awry at times.\nIncidentally, the foundation meeting In New York gave me considerable\npause. Distinctly on the plus side, they now have awareness - at\nleast In some quarters - of the necessity for a comprehensive and conÂ¬\nsistent ETV policy. At the same time (and I talked this with Harley),\nI believe we have to really come up with something If we stay in the\nmoney ring. Certainly, the temporary \"breather11 for the JCET Is fine\nand even the method of securing it may be okay, provided It is temporary.\nAnd while neither NAEB nor the other constituent groups apparently were\ncontacted ahead of time, presumably the ne^t JCET meeting will at least\nsee this occur officially. More serious, I think, is the dilemma NAEB\nnow faces. If It chooses to turn over its network, presumably it could\nsecure financing as a professional group. If It does not (and this, of\ncourse, is the organization's option), presumably that financing from\none source, at least, would not be forthcoming*\nIt behooves us to have some pretty concrete notions before our special\nluncheon meeting In Detroit at the convention.\nRegards...\nRichard B. Hull, Director\nRadio and TV Broadcasting\nRBH/anh\ncc: William Harley"
