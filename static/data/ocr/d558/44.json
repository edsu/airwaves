What is called\nfor, then* is full assurance that no steps will be taken by either\nNAEB or the Center in this extremely crucial area of fund raising\nwithout mutual consultation and clearance as between the two\norganizations* \\fa in the Fund are entirely confident that given such\nan arrangement there can be full and complete understanding at al\ntimes as to the fund raising activities for both organizations*\nI know that you fully share our feeling that the potential of tie\nmass media in education is too great to permit of any approaches that\nwould run the risk of weakening the common effort* Accordingly* what¬\never specific decisions may be reached in individual instances il.\nseems clear that the basic principle all of us have to adhere to is\nthat of joint consultation and joint effort in behalf of common aims a\nSincerely*\nC» Scott Fletcher\ngc\nCopy made* NAEB Headquarters*\nNovember 16* 1953«"
