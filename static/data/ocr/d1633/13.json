The work was\ndivided into three parts? 1) frequency requirements analysis! 2) propagation data;\nand 3) sharing possibilities. They are trying to fulfill the requirements of\nseventy-two countries! the earth has been divided into sixty-three areas. A set-up\nsimilar to the FCC method has been established.\nWhile the analysis shows, from the list of requested frequencies, that the_United\nStates is placed in seventh place in the world, the U. S. requests are confined\npurely to international broadcasting, while many other countries have requested low-\npower use of the frequencies for domestic and tropical broadcasting.\nRussia, outstanding proponent at Atlantic City for the establishment of a priority\nsystem for allocation of channels, reintroduced its proposal that frequencies for\ndomestic use should have precedence over the international channel use. Likewise,\nthe French claim priority of use for Colonial services but did not propose commer¬\ncial broadcasting be given last priority. Both the Soviet and French priority\nproposals have been opposed by the United States.\nThe controversial method of voting on important issues was resolved on a majority\nbasis, as at Atlantic City, rather than according to the Russian proposal that all\naction be by unanimous decisions. The Soviet proposal which would in effect have\nprovided a veto power was defeated 4-0.\nRADIO KEYED TO CORRESPONDENCE LESSONS\nA series of weekly broadcasts over WHA, WLBL, and the FM stations of the State\nRadio Council follows the units in a correspondence course offered by the University\nof Ylisconsin Extension Division.
