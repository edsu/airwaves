As I indicated to you in my last letter, there is a\nNut-Shell Report of our accomplishments in the next News-Letter.\nI cannot tell you how important it is to get the membership\nbooklet on NASB out as soon as possible. / I hope you have seen\nthe item in this week*s wTIMEn about the Smythe-Horton Study.\nI shall certainly do everything possible to arrange\nfor some sort of financing plan for you during the summer. If\nwe go ahead with an NASB fund-raising drive, this should be\ncomparatively simple, but you certainly ought to plan to be up\nhere in any case.\nCharles thinks a great deal of you, as you probably\nknow, and I*d like, \"like the Dickens'1, to see you get your\ndegree.\nWith all best wishes, I am\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
