If HAEB can deliver\nstations for the programs it produces, it might interest a few people\nin having it take a cut of the costs, but I don't believe anyone is\ngoing to pay HAEB much of a fee to produce programs that will not be\nshown anywhere.\nAs to whether Qunn has changed his mind, perhaps you should ask him,\nfor the comments I get from others in his region, and from him do\nnot indicate he has changed much. The thing he and I both regret is\nthat in a matter which we, and others, felt so keenly should be\nreferred to the membership concerned with television, the staff and\nthe radio board â€” and Schwarswalder*s friends, were unwilling to\nrisk submitting to the stations. The time lost then might well have\nsaved a lot of time and troubles later.\nYou and Jim Day should decide who, down your way, will take on the\nTV directorate for the region, for I had decided, even before this\nrtokus developed, that I had served my time and would not be a\ncandidate for reelection this Fall.\nBest regards.\nLoren B.
