So now you see I*ve brought it, and I want to get\nat him, with it.\n% lad, it* a not an easy matter for a stranger to come near the Soper or,\nand I8m afraid he811 take no notice of your present* You8d better keep it.\nI ain*t going to keep it. I tell you, I want to talk to him* I except I car\ntell him a thing or two about America. I guess he8d like mighty well to\nhear about our new railroads, and our free schools, and wist a big\nswell our steamers cut. And when he hears how well our people are\ngetting on, it may put him up to getting him doing something. The long\nand the short on*t is, I shanet be easy till I get a talk with the Emperor\nof Russia. And I should like to see his wife and children, too. I want\nto see how such folks bring up a family.\nWell, sir, since you8re so determined, 1*11 do what I can for you; but\nyou’d better expect to be disappointed. Whatever you dofis going to be\nrather unusual, but I guess you8d better begin by calling on the vice-\nchancellor, and stating your wishes* He may be able to help you*\nThank you; that8s all I want from you* The vice-chancellor. 1*11 call\nagain and let you know how I got on*\nQUICK LITTLE BRIDGE"
