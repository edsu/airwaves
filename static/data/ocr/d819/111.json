  "text": "-2-\nthere are some reasons against holding this session with which I am not acquainted,\nI would suggest we go ahead with the plan such as Earl proposes.\nI have a few minor suggestions relative to the program which I probably ought\nto save until the site of the meeting is determined. However, just for the record\nI might suggest that it should be either Miles or Schooley who report on the News-\nLetter (page 2) rather than me since it is no longer under my jurisdiction. Perhaps\nI could talk about some of our network television planning3 it doesnft seem to me\nthat that subject is being covered very much in Earlfs proposed-outline, and I\nthink we in Minnesota have done as much as anybody in layingf^we state plans. UnforÂ¬\ntunately our legislature probably will not maet one wsy or the other on our proposal\nuntil about two weeks after the Chapel Hill meeting, but at least the bill will be\nbefore them and I can give a progress report. However all of this can be decided in\ndue course. If I come to the meeting, I shall be willing to make any contributions\nLari wishes.\nYours sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nVice President\ncc: Jim Miles\nFrank Schooley\nLari Wynn\nBPjcjm"
