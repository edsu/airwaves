The first will be a piiot phase in\nwhich a relatively small service will be established.\nThis phase will be used to do four things:\n. „ . Test the practibility of the distribution plan.\n. o .Find out how much actual use is made of the service.\n. . o Evaluate the material produced and the use made\nof this material.\n. • . investigate new material which can be made\navailable from other organizations or from\nwithin the Educational Broadcasting Field\nitself.\nThe tentative plan for the operation of the Demonstration\nMaterials Library Is as follows:\n1. The primary purpose of this library Is to make\navailable to local groups, materials to help them\ndevelop or improve classroom utilization of edu¬\ncational broadcasts. The kits to be developed are\nprimarily Intended to be used with groups but this\nwould not preclude Individual use.\n2. The Library will be set up and operated by the NAEB.\n3* A central location will be selected to house and\nadminister the library service. This might be\nfrom the Urbana office of the NAEB or from one of\nthe NAEB member stations."
