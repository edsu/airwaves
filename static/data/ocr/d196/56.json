But like the French* the Italians\nfind it very hard to take that final step and agree to put guns once again\nin the hands of Germans.\nThey say; We know the Germans, we had them in our country fro a\nlong time in world War II* first as allies of Fascist Italy and then as\nenemies of liberated Italy. There has been too little time for us to\nforget what they did and to get around to a readiness to trust them. And\nif you have ever visited the urdeatine caves at the south edge of Home*\nwhere the German SS slaughtered more than 300 Italian civilians in March\nof 1944, you can appreciate this feeling.\nIt has not been 91 very pleasant to write this particular Letter from\nItaly. But* as I said earlier* this growing concern of Italian democrats\nabout the course of American foreign policy is striking and impressive for\na newly-arrived American reporter. And let me repeat! these people are\nItalian democrats, representing the middle road partiesj the kind of\npeople on whom the ho pee for survival and strengthening of the Italian\ndemocracy must rest. They are our friends. They have supported American\npolicies in the past and would like to do so in the future.\nIt would be altogether too simple an explanation to say that these\nItalians have been influenced by Communist propaganda. And I believe\nthat their beliefs are held widely enough in this country so that they\ncannot be dismissed as unimportant. Hence, X thought I would make of\nthis letter from Italy a report on how at least a part of Italy — an\nimportant Ml§p part — looks at America."
