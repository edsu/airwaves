Since Dick was the only one who\nhad replied to my request for suggestions, I said to bring him along\nif he were available* X also indicated my feeling to Harry that the\ncost of the meeting should be charged against the money allotted to\nRegion III for its convention*\nEvidently this conversation conveyed the notion to Harry that\nX wanted all of the members of the planning committee to come to\nthe meeting in Chicago and he accordingly seat out his letter of\nDecember 30 Including the tax exempt certificates and so forth to\nHull and Bouswraa. This, of course, is why neither Prank nor Dick\nHull had any previous information about the Chicago meeting until\nthey got Barry's letter* The result of this was a little larger\nexpenditure than we could well afford for this kind of planning\nget together, but if you or Rider can recapture any of the expense\nwe won't make out too badly.\nOf much more importance is the fact that we had a good meeting\nmid X think came up with some first-rate ideas for the agenda* XÂ£\nour plans pan out, we ought to have one of the most successful\nregional meetings ever*\nVary cordially yours.\nWilllam G* Harley\nUGHsJc"
