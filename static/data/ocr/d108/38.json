Mr* John Lerch..\ni^TITarltet. 8239 A.U.\nAPO 500\nSen Francisco, California\nDear John:\nThe first REPORT FROM JAPAN tape was handed to be© just twenty minutes ago,\nand I’d like to send ngr personal reactions immediately.\nI have only two or three suggestions. The recurrent theme (western music)\nin the early part of the program, it seems to me, is used too often. I’d\neither use it only to introduce that part of the program or not at all,\nusing only the oriental music (what do they call it? a koto? something\nlike that?) to separate the sections of the program. This is a personal\nreaction, of course.\nEarly in the program you say that someone Mthis week stated.\" It would\nbe better to use some such phrase as \"recently stated\" since our member\nstations will not be able to use programs within the week of the recording.\nNot necessary to say (at the end of the tape) \"the National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters,in Uibana, Illinois.\" Just say \"the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters.”\nI found the information you gave most interesting. I stuck with the program\nto the end through interest, not duty, and I look forward to the announced\nsecond program.\nI*m sending a copy of the tape to the chairman of our International Rela¬\ntions Committee, Seymour Siegel, Manager of WNYC, N.Y.C. (2500 Municipal\nBuilding, N. Y. &). He may have other suggestions for you.\nGood luck with the forthcoming programs, John. I think you’re going to\nturn out a good series.\nSincerely,\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager\nJHscr"
