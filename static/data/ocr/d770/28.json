  "text": "July 16, 1968\nSir Charles Moses\nSecretary-General\nAsian Broadcasting Union\nBox 3636 G.P.O.\nSydney, Australia\nDear Sir Charles:\nFirst let me begin by apologizing for my neglect of\ncorrespondence from the Asian Broadcasting Union. Partly\nthis is due, as you suggest, to the fact that we have been\nfairly busy, but also it has been due, I suspect, in some\nmeasure to my feeling that until we had paid our dues we\nweren't really full-fledged members and I felt a little\nguilty about it.\nI'm designating as ABU's Liaison Officer for routine\ncontacts Mr. James Fellows, of our staff. Correspondence\nshould be sent to him at the above address.\nAs Technical Liaison Officer I am appointing Mr. William\nKessler, who serves as a consultant engineer on all of our\nforeign projects. His address is 3857 West University Avenue,\nGainesville, Florida.\nAgain this year, unfortunately, I will be fo®eed to fore¬\ngo the pleasure of attending the ABU's general assembly,\nbecause it is so close to our own National Convention, November\n19 - 22. Some year I hope that the ABU meeting may be in a\nmonth other then November so that I will be able to attend.\nIn the meantime, I will be in Tokyo as one of the judges for\nthe ffapan Prize. I will be there from October 26th to\nNovember 5th. If you happen to be in Tokyo then. Jewel and\nI would love to see you again.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH/bp"
