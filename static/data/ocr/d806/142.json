One thing I did fail to mention, I believe, is that\nthe credit card may b© used only for those trips which are\npaid out of the Kellogg Trust* That, obviously, limits some\nof your usage of same.\nNow, on the travel advance, I have no objection,\ntut I do think this should be authorised by Board, or at\nleast Executive Committee* At no time since X have been\ntreasurer has anyone, including Si, had any advance of this\ntype* People like Si, and Paulu, and Atmos# and Dunn all\nhave had. monies, but they have cm® from other sources; not\nfVoa the treasurer* X mention this because I believe this is\nthe wrong way to do things, <H e*f the time element. X do»H\nhave Paulu funds from 1952 convention (and there Is & technical\nproblem involved with bonk only; he once sent check)# X do not\nhave Dunn convention report or cash* Si never had a travel\nadvance from treasurer, but always seemed to have funds* I\npersonally am opposed to a president1 s contingency fund, X am\nnot opposed to a president*© advance of a fixed sum for pur¬\nposed of travel, providing this is authorised* In general, I*m\nopposed our our officer® having funds such as this, but I\nbelieve our dear Mr* President should not be called upon to put\nup his own funds or borrow s^me. It may end up the same way, but\nX trust you see my point, sir.\nNothing here is said with malice. It just seems to me that\nmy suggestions are more business-like for our type of operations*\nAny snow in Alabama?\nRegards,\nFESsdo\ncc« Skomia\nFrank E* SchooXey\nTreasurer"
