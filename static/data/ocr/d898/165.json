Quayle\nGeneral Consultant\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n545 Madison Avenue, 6th Floor\nNew York, New York\nDear Dons\nI have reviewed the September, 1968 proposal re¬\nquesting support for the operation of the National\nEducational Radio Network. As you asked, the\nproposal has been adjusted downward to the $65,000\nlevel and requests for equipment have been eliminated.\nWe would propose to make required equipment purchases\n(and in one instance have already done so) from the\nnetwork’s current operating budget.\nWhile the network operates on a July 1 - June 30\nfiscal year, no problems will be created if Corp¬\noration funding is based on a calendar year schedule.\nThe proposal for relocating the network headquarters\nfrom Urbana to Washington, D* C. and a revised version\nof the Public Affairs Bureau proposal will be forwarded\nsoon along with the other materials I have been pre¬\nparing re interconnected radio networking.\nWhen the NER Network grant is finalized, notification\nshould be made to the President of the NAEB, William\nHarley.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAMslkl\nEnclosure\ncc; W. G. Harley"
