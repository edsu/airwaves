Much testimony was given on\nthe scarcity of materials, the inadequacy of the material that\nwas available, and the great need for help In the utilization\narea. From the personal experience of the committee members\nit was also obvious that, while materials did not now exist,\nthey could be developed. The committee felt that If the\nmaterials were made available they would be used, but that It\nwould be advisable to set up a pilot library project with a\nreasonable number of offerings to see what actual use would\nbe made of a full scale library service."
