I utilized the wording in your promotional\nmaterial in a \"Memo to Managers\" that will go out of\nour office on August 30.\n1*11 be interested in learning about any added affil¬\niates (or even any inquiries) that may result.\nYou asked that we provide some subject matter topics\nfor \"Night Call.\" A list is enclosed. It was prepared\nby Ken Clark, currently on a 90 day assignment with\nNAEB to develop information regarding programming being\ndone by educational radio and television stations. I\nlearned after our visit that Ken planned to develop some\ninformation about your program* My apologies for not\nputting you in touch with each other while you were in\nWashington.\nThe suggestion that \"Night Call\" originate from the Sheraton\nPark Hotel during the 44th annual NAEB Convention on Nov¬\nember 21 (Thursday) has met with great favor from other\nstaff members. I hope we can work out the details and\nI#ll be getting in touch with you shortly after Labor Day\nto work on this. If you see reasons developing why an\norigination from the convention would not be possible,\nI*d appreciate hearing.\nThe Instructional and Professional Services Division of\nNAEB has a convention session scheduled involving telephoae\ncall in programs. I believe you will be hearing from\neither Lewis Rhodes or Robert Maull regarding that special\ninterest session. I believe they will ask for Del Shields\nto participate in that session."
