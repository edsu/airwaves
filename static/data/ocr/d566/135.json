We conxtinue to be plagued with\nthe old problem of insufficient communication* Network\ncommitments are made, and other arrangements consumated without\nfully informing everyone concerned. This naturally results\nin some loss of efficiency.\n7. In-school programs. At this point we have not found an\nanswer to the problem of distributing in-school programs.\nThis type of service must be developed into a substantial one if\nwe are to expect the school stations to continue as full-paying\nmembers of the network.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nIt Is my carefully considered opinion that the network as\nit is now operated is not of sufficient character to warrant the\ncontinued payment of substantial membership fees by the stations.\nTo insure that it does achieve such a character, I make the\nfollowing recommendations. The pressing Immediate needs upon\nwhich action can be taken at this time will be discussdd by\nnumber corresponding to the problems listed above. Some of the\nmore distant aspects such as personnel needs (about which I am\nnow running a crude study), program plans, etc. will be covered\nin an additional section."
