Lou Peneguy ,\nAlabama EOT Commission\n2151 Highland Avenue\nSuite 206\nBirmingham# Alabama 35205\nDear Mr Peneguy:\nnext Keys letter will contain a list of HAEB Committees, and I wanted\nto let you know why the Public Relatione Committee is no longer listed/\nEhere is no doubt that the NAEB needs a well developed PR program, but\nthis should really be a staff function. I believe you will agree that\na sound Public Relations program cannot be conducted by a committee. If\ncertain specific matters seem to need committee advice and assistance\n(e.g. the present work being done by lee Campion add Marion Corwell on\na speakers guide), either ad hoc csramittees, or one or two individuals will\nbe asked to help out.\nI appreciate the very real service this committee has provided in the\nface of extreme administrative difficulties, and you may be sure that\n1 will call upon you again.\nSincere|y,\nWilliam G. Harley\nHEH:kk"
