Is it garbage?\nHo sir, it is not. All those commodities coma from hats. No nation\non earth uses a hat for so many purposes as a Yankees it serves him\nat once for a head-covering, a writing desk, a larder, and a port-\nmanteau. In it, the merchant deposits patterns of various descrip¬\ntions: the doctor uses it as an apothecary8 s shop5 the married man re**\nturning from market, converts it into a depository for potatoes and\nother vegetables: to the traveller it serves as a knapsack. Nothing\nhas been more severly censured among enlightened people then the reform\nlately introduced in the shape of hats. By the present fashion, it\nis next to impossible to put more in its inside than a pocket handker¬\nchief and a dozen of cigars. Should, unfortunately, the present form\nbe still more curtailed, then there will be no enduring the caprice\nof fashion, and who knows but a dreadful revolution may be the conse¬\nquence?\nA hat has unquestionably more duties to perform in -these United States\nthan in any other country. Ho wonder, whenever the wind blows, a shoal\nof imprisoned objects take advantage of their liberty.\nThat, sir, is the truth $ and now, if you911 be so good as to excuse\nme, I want to see if my wife8 s cousin cams down from Newport on this\nship, which I see is now unloading.\nA -SHALL ttBHMSR W PASSING VOICES"
