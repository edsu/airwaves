  "text": "Dr. Harry Skornia\n2\nFebruary 8, 1961\nexcerpts from a variety of kinds of educational program fare around the country,\nI believe Florence has already agreed to accept requests from RCA and some other\nelectronic manufacturer to present technical papers. RCA will have a color-\nvideo machine on hand, which would be available to us for presentation on video¬\ntape .\nAnyway, would you give some thought to what you consider might be appropriate\nfor this session and you may wish to refer this to your committee or to the TV\nPlanning Committee as something on which they could make a contribution.\nIn case you are wondering - no, we don't have any assured funds for anyone to\ngo to Switzerland, but Lennie said we should be all means accept and we would\nworry about getting the money later on.\nThree, if portions of the President’s column in the current NAEB Newsletter sound\nfamiliar, it’s no wonder - since I stole some of your phrasing on the memorandum\nyou’ve prepared for the Washington Academy proposal. I don’t know how this\nentente cordiale with the Center is going to work out, but frankly, in the face of\ncurrent realities it not only makes sense but is in our own self-interest. My\nprinciple force of hope and faith lies in Jim Robertson, who is a former student of\nmine and one-time friend, he is more to be trusted than some others. And as a\nnew Vice-President he not only has some power of his own but remains close to\nthe throne room, However, ...\nFour, I have a lot more things to take up with you but they can wait until you\nshow in Washington. We look forward to your visit and will try and arrange to\nhave that white stuff no higher than your shoe tops by then. I will be in East\nLansing on 2 and 3rd but will return Saturday afternoon 4th, and can probably\nsee you that evening or Sunday morning.\nCordially yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nPresident\nWGHijph"
