Marshall\nDivision of Radio and Television\nBoard of Education\n228 North LaSalle Street\nChicago lf Illinoie\nDear List\nThere is still no answer from the front office\nabout our proposed project# I have delayed writing\nyou and George until I had some indication that\nofficially the Chicago Schools said ttyes*Â». I*m at\na bit of a loss to know just how to proceed. I could\nwrite a follow-up letter to Superintendent Willis,\nbut this would seem rather silly since I had already\nmade a contact with you# I would be very much in the\nposition of saying that you had told me we were going\nahead but to wait until official confirmation had come\nthrough. On the other hand I could write to George\nand find out from him what the next step should be\nbut as of yet I have neither had an answer to ray\nletter requesting an appointment nor any information\nas to what he had recommended be done to my request\nto Willis # I don* t want to be talking when I should\nbe listening and I*m not sure how far I should go.\nIf you have any information that can help me get\nthis project Hoff dead center** please send it along.\nPerhaps this is something that I had better straighten\nout through a phone call. If this seems advisable,\nlet me know and I will call the right people.\nSincerely,\nClair R. Tettemer\nDirector of School Programs\nand Research\nCRT/rjd\nBC/ Harold Hill"
