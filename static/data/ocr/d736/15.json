Skornia,\nExecutive Director of the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters to say that we would make\nour magazine News from behind the Iron Curtain\navailable to the active membership as a help in\nbuilding programs. We distribute the magazine\ngratis to American press and radio for re-use, and\nto others especially interested in the Communist-\ndominated countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\nThe magazine is written from material gathered\nprimarily for Radio Free Europe broadcasts. Our\nexile staff translates about 300 newspapers and\nperiodicals from the satellite countries every\nweek, and we monitor 22 Communist radio stations\ndaily from several different points in Europe.\nIn addition, we use refugee reports.\nAt Mr. SkorniaTs suggestion, we have added your\nname to the mailing list both for the magazine\nand for weekly releases which we issue. The\nreleases are human interest items suitable for\nfeature stories on a newscast.\nWe are acting on the theory that an informed\nAmerican public is better able to resist the\nspread of Communism here. From the reaction we\nhave had from the press and radio, we find that\nthere is a genuine interest in the satellite area\non the part of the American public.\nWe hope that you will be able to use this material,\nand that you will give us your comments on it.\nVery sincerely yours,\nRita Whearty (y\nResearch and\nPublications Service\nRW/gr\nEnel."
