The time patience, guidance and\nwisdom you have contributed mid sore contributing so generously will not\nbe forgotten soon, Blok. I only wish we had a way of thanking you in\nmore concrete ways. Meanwhile, though ~~ I certainly agree, and am\nmost grateful.\nOn another point i I*ve been urging the USCE, in the face of Foundation\npressures to take over leadership in education in television particularly,\nto press for the sanB kind of revision of salary scales, etc. that the\nUSIA finally had to do to attract some top people. 1 have said, for\nexample, that what they reed is someone like you, Schramm or Ralph Tyler\nto head up what would be a real leadership role in educational television\nand radio research. But that tt»s an Insult to ask any of you to serve\nunder present salary and other conditions. They keep asking me to\nsuggest \"people.” This has essentially my answer. But I«d be grateful\nfor any reaction you might hare to any of this.\nSincerely,\nHJStjp\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director"
