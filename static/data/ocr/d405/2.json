Westbrook\nChairman, NAEB Acceptance Committee\nRadio Station WUQT\nUniversity of Tennessee\nBox 85^0\nKnoxvillef Tennessee\nDear Mr* Westbrooki /\nI listened to Dr. Urey’s Lecture, taped at the\nUniversity of Louisville. Th4 distinguished Dr. Urey\nis probably more at home In. the laboratory than he\nis on the speaker’s platfOrnu Nonetheless, I felt\nthere was enough material of real merit in his speech\nto warrant network distribution. I for one, am\npleased that J)drcas Ruthenburg suggested to Dr. Skornia\nthat the Network Acceptance Committee vote on the\nLouisville Lecture series. The group certainly is\na distinguished one and I think we’ll be all richer\nfor accepting the Entire series. I vote yes.\nSincerely,\nJim Slack\nManager, KUSD\nJS/eg\nc.c. to John Holt"
