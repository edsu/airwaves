I am pleased to know\nWofford will be doing some television production this fall.\nAs to some help, you mentioned Dan Wozniak, and I think he\nis very well suited to offer you assistance. Another tip would be to\nwrite to Dr. Harry Skornia, National Association of Educational Broad¬\ncasters, lU Gregory Hall, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois.\nThe association has many seminar and workshop reports and other items\nthat should help you very much. I will send Dr. Skornia a copy of this\nletter so he will know that you are going to write. Wofford would be\neligible .for associate membership possibly in the National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters when your production center is functioning.\nPlease let me know if you do not receive as much information\nas you would like and I will sit down and write as much as I can think\nof that might help you. Thanks very much for writing us and good luck\nthis fall.\nSincerely,\nKDWiera\nKenneth D. Wright\nProgram Associate"
