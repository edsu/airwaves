C.\nMy dear Mr. President\nAt your Wednesday press conference you indicated that you were\nnot sufficiently informed to comment on the educational television bill.\nWe are certain, however, that this response does not indicate a lack of\ninterest on your part in such legislation. In view of your statements to\nour last two national conventions, we know that you favor federal sup¬\nport of television as an aid to education and two prominent members of\nyour administration. Secretary Ribicoff and Chairman Minow, have strongly\nendorsed legislation aimed at this objective.\nWithout this background, however, some may be inclined to put\nan adverse construction upon your response.\n• After you have had an opportunity to inform yourself more fully\non this legislation,which we believe to be vitally important if excellence\ncan become a realizable goal of American education, it would have a most\nsalutary effect on the course of this legislation if you were to make a\nstatement regarding your views on this matter at a subsequent press\nconference.\nRespectfully yours.\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH/vr"
