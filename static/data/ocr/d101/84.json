  "text": "REPORT OF THE MAEB RESEARCH GO&MITTIE\nOCTOBER, 1959\nThe MSB Research Gonsalttee has been concerned primarily with\ntwo projects during this past year. It has continued to evaluate\nthe research proposals which have been made t® the HAEB and has made\nrecossaendations on those which were to be given grants-in-ald * It\nhas also assisted in the formation and refinement of the Under-\nstanding Media proposal for which the United States Department ©£\nHealth* Education* md Welfare has made a preliminary grant to the\nMEB under Title VII of the Aid t© Education act.\nFrom its experiences during the past few years* the Committee\nfeels that the role of the MEB in the area of research (and, hence*\nthe role ©£ the Research Committee) needs to be reappraised. The\nCommittee feels that it is neither feasible nor desirable for a\nprofessional organisation such as the MEB t© engage directly in\nresearcho It feels* rather* that the MSB should encourage needed\nresearch among its member institutions and* when necessary* aid its\nmembers in this task. T© this latter end* the Committee recommends\nthat the MEB increase the funds available for the research grants-\nin-aid program so that research grants with a minimum value of\n$2*000 might be made. It also recommends that the MEB expand Its\nconsulting service to include research consultation* so that member\ninstitutions might he given help in evaluating their research needs*\nplanning programs of research* drawing up research proposals* or\neven evaluating research results. In this way* the MEB could provide\na greater service t© more ©f its members and* hence* to the\neducational broadcasting movement."
