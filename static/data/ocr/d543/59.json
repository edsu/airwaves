Harley\n600 North Park\nMadison, Wisconsin\nDear Bill;\nAll of the Mileses had a wonderful time at\nMadison. We enjoyed every minute of it, even the\nrather startling Lake Mendotta episode. I am\nCERTAIN YOU WENT WELL BEYOND THE CALL OF FRIENDSHIP\nIN HOSTING US, BUT I DID WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE\nREALLY APPRECIATED IT. I AM TRULY HOPEFUL THAT WE\nWILL BE ABLE TO REPAY YOU IN SOME SMALL ME AUS RE\nSOME DAY.\nAs I REVIEW THE MANY CONVERSATIONS AT MADISON,\nI COME AWAY WITH THE FEELING THAT WE REALLY MADE SOME\nPROGRESS. I BELIEVE WE NOW HAVE A SOLID CORE WHICH\nWILL SUPPORT THE VARIOUS STANDS WE HAVE TAKEN. I\nFEEL APPRECIABLY BETTER ABOUT GETTING THE CONSTITUTION\nAPPROVED AT DETROIT. I THINK WE HAVE FAIRLY SOLID\nFOOTING FOR THE WASHINGTON MOVE, AND I BELIEVE THIS\nPART OF THE MEMBERSHIP AT LEAST RECOGNIZES THE\nCOMPLICATED NETWORK SITUATION SO THAT IT WILL NOT\nBE HARD TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO FOR A FEW YEARS\nAT LEAST.\nAll in all it was a typical NAEB meeting and I\nRATHER CONTINUE TO AMAZE MYSELF THAT AFTER ALL THEBE\nYEARS I CAN COME AWAY FROM SUCH AN AFFAIR TRULY\nSTIMULATED. PERHAPS THIS ONE HAS RALLIED US OFF\nDEAD CENTER AND STARTED US ON THE ROAD AHEAD.\nSee you in Washington.\nSlNCERELY,\nDI RECTOR\nWBAA Radio - TV Unit\nJSM:vml\nPURDUE\nTHE VOICE OF\nWBAA(M,)"
