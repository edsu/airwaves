These have\nprovided excellent experiences for the personnel involved, but there\nvan no coordinated approach as Is herewith proposed.\nSpecialists in iater-eedla learning would be Included asoag\nthe consultants to discuss not only tbs related use of the various\nnedla, but also to speak on general learning theories and how these\nnay be appUed to ITT and the other related nedla.\nParticipants la the workshops would be naked to bring klaeseopod\nor videotaped exaaples of outstanding or unusual Instructional\npregrass for screening and discussion by the workshop group. This\nwould probably include scaM couplets programs and ass excerpts\nof unusual value from other programs. In addition, an effort would\nbe sate to secure a few outstanding examples of foreign Instructional\nTV programs for scseening and discussion by the workshop participants.\nAm a corollary to the demonstrations outlined above, each\ninterest group among the participants would be given speclalined\ninstruction. Studio teachers would be given help In how to prepare,\nresearch, plan and present lessons. They would also meet with studio\nproducers so that each group would have an opportunity to learn aero\nabout the problems of the ether. Sessions on techniques would bo hold\nfor these groups. Including, perhaps, discussion of staging and\nlighting and graphics, especially as applicable to ITT.\nIt is expected that consultants and the workshop director will\nmeet for several days prior to each workshop to develop detailed\nplsas for the demonstrations and other teaching sessions so that\nall might be presented to the participants as an Integrated whole."
