The symbolic\nlogicians, and others, are aware of the\ndistortions of thought so recorded, and find\nlittle good in traditional logic.\nIn the same way, anthropologists, seeking to\ncommunicate a full account of the archaic\ncultures, find the literacy means of de¬\nscription inadequate compared to the movie\nwhich can capture multiple facets and relations\nof situations in a single shot.\nfl) Writing first gave man the power to consider\none -thing-at -a-t Ime.\n(m) Oral or pre-literate man did not have the\nmeans to do this, but took whole situations in\ntheir togetherness as we find in \"primitive”\nlanguages."
