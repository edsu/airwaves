Johnson\n-2-\nDecember 20, 1956\nsending you samples of same of the materials we regularly send our members, plus\nother items which will give you mare information about the Association* Of course.\nAssociate, Affiliate and Individual members do not receive as many of these materials\nas regularly as Active members do*\nAccording to a resolution passed by the NAEB membership at the 1956 convention,\nall dues will be increased slightly in January, 1958*\nActive members with radio stations may use the facilities of the NAEB Radio Network\nupon payment of an annual network fee. The Network distributes approximately eight\nhours of programing, by tape recording, weekly, to members subscribing to its\nservice* This fee is also based on power (with the same power classifications as\nmembership) and a new station does not have to pay the full fee until the third\nyear it is in the Network. The fees are:\nGlass A\nClass B\nGlass G\n500.00\n300.00\n150.00 225.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from Network •\nHeadquarters here in Ur bans, Illinois. Still even a Class A station paying its full\nthird-year rate is paying only a little over $2.00 an hour for better than 400 hours\nof programming from the Network in a year. This is about the most inexpensive\nprogramming a station can do.\nWe would be very happy to assist you in anyway possible with your proposed FM\nstation IF it is to be a regular broadcasting station and not wired-wireless.\nIncluded in the materials being sent under separate cover are some items dealing\nwith how to go about establishing an FM station, sample costs, etc. So far as TV\nis concerned, it’s possible that we may be able to lend you some engineering\nassistance even though your operation is to be closed-circuit only.\nIf after you’ve looked over the materials you have any questions, please let me\nknow.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHidfc"
