Would you be willing to have your list so\npublicized ?\nSecondly, the committee would like to encourage you to expand your\ncollection to include examples of college level instruction and per¬\nhaps post-graduate instruction. It is thought that in addition to\nhaving complete lessons available, it would also be extremely useful\nto have collections of excerpts from lessons. These might be assembled\non the basis of several different classifications - e.g., (1) methods of\npresenting various subjects via television (history, literature, psy¬\nchology, etc.), especially those which do not lend themselves to easy\nvisualization, and where the talking face tends to predominate at\npresent, and (2) ways of using different kinds of visual materials in\nvaried subject areas (e.g., charts and diagrams, demonstrations,\nmodels, the chalk board, the overhead projector, slides and films,\nguests or discussion groups, etc.).\nIt is believed that such films would be invaluable for workshops,\nfaculty meetings and for work with individual television teachers. The\nnew regional libraries of recorded televised instruction may be willing\nto cooperate in lending tapes in order to record sections on kine.\nSuch collections of excerpts would of course necessarily carry their\nown sound, additional information could be provided in printed form.\nOur committee hopes that you would be interested in expanding your\npresent project along the lines proposed above. We would give you all\npossible personal assistance.\nSincerely yours,\nL. P. Greenhill\nAssociate Director\nP.S. I have ordered for you a print of our sample kine showing\nprogrammed algebra on television."
