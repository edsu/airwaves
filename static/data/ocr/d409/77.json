Hadsell\nUniversity of Wisconsin, School of Education - Frank Estvan\nOhio State University, School of Education - Hazel Gibbony and\nEdgar Bale\nReading Clinics\n(Prepared by Eva Mahoney, Director of Reading Clinic, Psychological Services\nBureau, Georgetown University, and Mary Coleman, Director of Reading Clinic,\nGeorge Washington University.)\nPurpose and Scope\nThe primary function of many university reading clinics is to serve the\nstudents of the various colleges of the university. These services take the\nform of testing, individual instruction, and classes in reading improvement\nor reading-study skills. The secondary function is to make the facilities\navailable to faculty and to the community to the extent that these activities\ndo not limit the facilities, staff time, or supervision of college students.\nOften the clinic serves the school of education by providing a training\ncenter for students majoring in education and reading. Graduate students may,\nunder supervision, assist in diagnostic and in individual and group instrucÂ¬\ntion of children, college students, and adults. When this is the case, the\nclinic staff also teaches education courses related to the teaching of reading.\nWith the increase in college enrollments, the services of the reading\nclinic become important to the entire university. If the reading clinic is\nuniversity sponsored with the staff responsible to the president, the service\nis mors easily available to all of the schools of the university.\nThe organization, in terms of the total university, can be accomplished"
