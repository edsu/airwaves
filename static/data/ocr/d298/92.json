  "text": "'* l %\nla the third piece, I would suggest that the Commission state specifically\nthat editorializing is not involved when radio is used to bring to public\nattention conditions and problems with which the citizenry should deal, £\nsee no reason why a broadcaster should be prevented from giving publicity\nto bad housing conditions, to an unsavory water supply, to deplorable recre¬\nation facilities for youth, or to improperly regulated traffic. So long as\nthe broadcasts are confined to an honest portrayal of conditions, no editor¬\nializing is involved. Z see no objection to the use of the documentary or\nthe dramatized approach to such broadcasting* If# however, the broadcaster\ngoes further to indicate solutions, he may become involved in controversy.\nAt this point, therefore, he should give equal opportunity for the various\nsides of the issues to be heard. The station licensee can present situations\nrequiring solution. He can advocate that they be solved. But when he\nadvocates a particular solution he must appear because he has special interest\nor competency and he must ensure that advocates of other solutions have equal\nopportunity to be heard.\nIt should be recognized that no set of rules spelled out by the Commission\nwill be capable of meeting all of the possible situations that may arise.\nUnquestionably there vdll be borderline cases between the right of a station J\nto throw the spotlight of public attention upon troublesome problems and\nthe taking of a positioh on a controversial issue. Always it will be the\ni\nresponsibility of the licensee to use his best judgement in furthering the\npublic interest, convenience and necessity. But it should be clear, as a\nprinciple# that the preservation of freedom of speech for all citizens over\nlimited radio facilities is sore important than the freedom of the 2000\nlicensees themselves,"
