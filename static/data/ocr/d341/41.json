  "text": "Mr* Hudson — 2\nThere was some evidence, albeit belated, of such a procedure in the\nexcellent \"progress report ** with which Ray Stanley provided our Committee\n^ in St* Louis last month* I hope you will understand our perplexity on\nleaning that several excellent series ideas — designed, as we saw it,\nadsdrahdy to augment what the grants had achieved — have either died on\nthe vine or — by an orthodoxy with which we are _been tabled\nas appropriate matters for consideration under next year8 s grants-in-aid\nactivities*\nThus, as w» see It, such efforts as there were to employ the contracts\nin the Banner which we understood was contemplated not only came too\nlate and too little, but were inexplicably dropped as far as this year is\nooooeraed* Instead, wa ware confronted at the last moment end in great\nhaste with a project which, as I've indicated, we accepted faute de mieux*\nto which we could take no major substantive exception, but wEich was\npresented to us in 9 rather unsatisfactory context* Even the rather sketchy\naccount we were given raised serious questions. Mr* Stanley indicated that\na relatively large sum of money (between twenty and thirty thousand dollars!)\nwould be expended on a program about which we were able to learn very\nlittle* The account of the format is vagus* There is virtually no indication\nof the Intellectual approach or contest involved in dealing with grave\nworld problems; we have to assume that, up-to-the-minute topicality being\nImpossible, there will be some sort of \"depth0 (historical? philosophic?;\n* in the treatment of these matters* We are in ignorance not only of how\nthese programs are to be done but even of wto will do them and where —\nthis in contrast to the painfully elaborate details, pilots, plan$ and\ncredentials required of applicants who seek only a tiny fraction of the\nw amount involved here for their grants-in-aid.\nAs I say, we had understood that one clear purpose of contract programs\nwould be to provide series in area neglected by grants* But this series\nis clearly in the area of the social sciences, into which fall six out of\nten of the programs for which grants have already been awarded this year*\nI think, too, that if the proposed series had been submitted for a grant,\neven assuming more details were provided, some of us may have felt that\nit fell between two stools: material for tie-in with serious study and\ndiscussion ought, we believe, to be the kind of rigorous, orderly raising\nof questions which the proposed series did little to suggest, while,\nforgetting the study tie-in, the dramatic underscoring of world issues is\ncertainly the kind of thing that commercial broadcasting is capable of\ndoing in a manner hard to match, even with so ambitious a budget* I must\nalso record the unhappiness of one Coranittee member, whose experience\nwith the programs and ancillary promotional and instructional devices of\nthe Foreign Policy Association was reported as uniformly unsatisfactory.\nIn all candor. Bob, this hasty rump-session (largely by 8phone) found the\nCommittee perplexed and disappointed* We were a group which had laboriously\nconsidered dozens of thoroughly planned proposals from eminent schools\nand educators, designed within a maximum budget of $7,000 to do, through\ngrants-in-aid, a conscientious, important broadcasting job* We had seen\n(and in many cases turned down for lack of funds) programs whose substance\ndid not vary greatly from the presumptive substance of this series, at\nleast in terms of importance in developing the twentieth-century American’s"
