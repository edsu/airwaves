I am sorry that you\nhave run into a situation where the Center is still developing routines,\nand inquiries like yours have not yet been frequently enough encountered\nto encounter more efficient handling. I think the replies you have re¬\nceived from Robert Hudson of the ETRC, as well as my own, have been sin¬\ncere, and represent no effort to give you the run-around.\nThe fact is that we have so many sources of programs from Europe that\nI do not feel that we could recommend, or request of the ETRC, a special\ngrant in this area for radio. In television, they need to wait for no\nspecial recommendation of course, and it was with the idea that some¬\nthing of possible value to them might emerge that I suggested your ad¬\ndressing Mr. Hudson.\nno longer have funds for special projects or grants to Individuals,\nas were made in the days when Milton Mayer did VOICES OF EUROPE. In\nother words you are the sort of problem that we do not yet have pro¬\nvision for helping. This in no wise indicates lack of interest end\nI hope will not discourage you in the approaches you make to other\nstations or networks. The economy of NAEB operation has always been\nsuch that we have had to count heavily on exchange arrangements with\nEuropean stations and persons, and on such free materials as Fulbright\nscholars from our member institutions have been able to provide, etc.\nWith reference to your listing me as a recommendation, I shall be\nglad to refer any investigator to Stu Green. Far your future refer*-\nenoe his full address is\nW. Stewart Green\n4370 Kraft Avenue\nNorth Hollywood, California"
