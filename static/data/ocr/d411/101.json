I refer specifically to this very delayed\nanswer to your letter of January 20,\nI note that you thoughtfully sent a carbon of it to\nHarry Skornia. Most of the questions raised are, I think,\nmore in his province than mine, since I leave details of\nbudget planning to him and to his staff. I think he has\nalready answered some of your questions, but I am sending\nhim a copy of this letter to remind him to cover any items\nhe may have skipped.\nThis, of course, is not to say that I am not willing\nor ready to help anytime I can be of assistance.\nWith best personal regards,\nYours sincerely\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP:ds\ncc: Harry J. Skornia"
