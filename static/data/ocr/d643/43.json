I shall\nprobably arrive May 6 via train, at 7:08 p.m.\nI suggest that no great purpose would be se^edby\nhaving a Foundations Committee report at the luncheon. I\nhave no serious objections if you feel otherwise, but there\nis little that can be said, and all this takes time.\nA brief report on the JOURNAL and on individual mem-\nberships might be appropriate for the Thursday luncheon. As\nJSTtaSS Schooley aSd Skomia will not be there - enroute to\nBattle Creek.\nFor the Board agenda, I suggest:\n_ FCC call for written arguments on scraping of Sixth\nReport and Order as relates to allocations (exempting educaÂ¬\ntional TV even so).\n__ Report of Publications Committee, and JOURNAL\n(via Schooley and/or for Stasheff).\n_ Report on Individual Membership drive.\nb. Other memberships.\n_ Foundation's Copnittee report, and consideration\nof some items.\nVia return air mail.\nRegards,\nPrank S. Schooley\nFES:nb\nCC: Skomia"
