  "text": "NETWORK LEGS\nOne improvement that appeared possible with the transfer\nof the network operation was the division of the stations into\nfour legs* This procedure allowed us to offer all programs to\nall stations, and at the same time to materially reduce the total\ntime required for a program to complete the circuit* An\nadditional benefit of this method is a device for preventing a\ncomplete breakdown of the network or any one of its legs,, Four\ncopies are made for distribution to the four legs* The master\nis retained at headouarters0 If a tape is delayed or lost in\nthe mails, the station affected wires network headquarters to\nthis effect* Another copy is made and sent air-mail special-\ndelivery to the next station* Thus, only one station suffers and\nthe remainder of the leg stays on schedule*\nIt will be noted in the tabular summer of programs\nthat the number of stations accepting each series has been\nsteadily increasing. It is ouite apparent that at least part\nof this trend is due to the increased efficiency possible when\noperating by legs*\nThe four legs are shown on the accompanying maps*\n(The original maps courtesy of Mrs. Terry Linder.)"
