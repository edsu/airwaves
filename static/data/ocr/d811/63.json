Kellogg Foundation\n250 Champion Street\nBattle Creek, Michigan\nDear Maurice:\nI would indeed be remiss if I did not\nadd ray expression of sincere appreciation to that\nalready voiced on behalf of NAEB by Harry Skornia.\nOne might challenge a statement that my appreciation\nis deeper than Skornia*s, but certainly you wouldn't\nchallenge one of longer standing. As an oldtimer,\nboth at Illinois and in NAEB, it is a real pleasure\nto note recognition given NAEB by the W. K. Kellogg\nFoundation. While fast going out of NAEB offices,\nI assure you of ray continued interest in and support\nof those things for which NAEB stands.\nWith kind personal regards to you, and\nto Mrs. Seay.\nSincerely,\n^ Frank E. Schooley\nDirector of University\nBroadcasting\nFESfb\ncc: Harry Skornia^\nWilliam Harley"
