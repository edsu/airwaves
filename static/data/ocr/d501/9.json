Even more interesting would\nbe some aspect of a child-rearing scene as per elements in the Hopi\nscripto\nI hope these suggestions are useful to you and that it v&ll be\npossible for the radio center and the NAEB to continue in the field of\nanthropology. Let me close by reiterating that in whatever area of\ninterest your plans start, turn it over to a competent anthropologist\nand let him take it from there.\nWarmest personal regards.\nSincerely yours,\n/S/ WALTER GOLDSCHMIDT"
