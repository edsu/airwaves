(And you can withhold your modesty a little\nwhen you send news of your operations to the NAEB pub¬\nlications, because you can be sure it is wanted.)\n• Do you — every' member of the staff — accept every op¬\nportunity for speeches where you can tell what you are doing?\n• And do you cooperate in every way possible with your or¬\nganization — the National Association of Educational Broad¬\ncasters? (Distinguished sendee with the NAEB implies a\ndistinguished broadcasting operation back home.)\nNo discount this time. No budget involvement\nhere.\nThe old mousetrap adage just doesn't work any more — at least not until\na sign is erected down at the far end of the path."
