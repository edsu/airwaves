Technical\nAssistance have asked ny advice on how Mr. Nizami can most usefully\nemploy this fellowship. I have suggested that he should spend\ntwo months at the B.B.C. in London and three months in the United\nStates. I thought that he might spend at least one month with the\nUnited Nations Radio Division at New York. I am confident that,\nif this can be arranged, ray friends in New York would make the\nnecessary arrangements for him to learn about the output of the four\nmajor networks*\nIn addition, I suggested that it would be very valuable for\nhim to spend some tims - perhaps two months * with the N.A.E.B.\nto learn their organization and the content of their programmes©\nWhat do you think about this suggestion? There would, of course,\nbe no expense to be borne by the N.A.E.B. as the travel and living\nexpenses would be arranged by Technical Assistance.\nI would be most grateful for an early reply as we have to\narrange the dates of his going to the B.B.C., to the United Nations\nand, should you think it a good idea, to the N.A.E.B.\nWith very best wishes.\nYours sincerely,\n/s/ Gordon\nGordon Fraser\nHead, Radio Division\nDepartment of Mass Communication\nP.S. Perhaps you would be\nloncT enough to pass this\nletter on to Mr. Rider if it is\nto him I should have written©\nMr. Robert Hudson,\nUniversity of Illinois,\n119 Gregory Hall,\nUrbans, Illinois,\nU.S.Ao"
