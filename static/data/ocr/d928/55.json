In determining areas of need\nthis individual would have the benefit of the committee's advice,\nadvice from other interested (and competent) parties not currently\nserving on the committee* and his own good sense* The network\noffice would* of course* cooperate with this individual by\nproviding Information re submission procedures and handling the\ndistribution of submissions to the judging members of the commitÂ¬\ntee*"
