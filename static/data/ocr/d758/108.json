Leo has me\non this APBE thing; and my share of the travel budget has to go for\nthat# (This year the question of the hour is, what travel budget?)\nMore to the point perhaps is the question whether Bill realized I\nam at Michigan State when he put me on the committee# (MSU is rather\nwell represented.) Considering I haven’t done one damn thing for\nyou, please let me know what you want me to do.\nBest,"
