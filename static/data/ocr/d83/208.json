Worthington, doluiabia University Pi-re ss )«**«• \"Like Mr, Duffer\nIn 3 A Painful Case, 8 Joyce apprehends an emotion in terms of rhythm.88\nLike Stephen in Stephan Hero, Joyce \"over all this chaos of history\nand legend, of fae£ and supposition, he strove to draw out a line\n©f order, to reduce the abysses of the past to order by a diagram*”\nBut whereas Joyce uses the melodic as well as the scribal line to\nachieve order, the present authors point to the significant fact that\nin Finnegans Wake Shorn the Penman is not allowed a song* All the\n©the*rcnaSc tors are presented by means of melodic allusion save he.\nTii© victory of St. Patrick over Berkeley the Arch-Druid, the theme\nof ”th@ restoration of Unity after Multiplicity... is announced by\nthe chimes of Father Prout fs The Bells of Shandon.” Patrick is\nassociated with Roms and the w^ten m&QB of' organization, Berkeley\nthe Arch-Druid is associated with the Celtic church with its oral\nand auditory patterns of organisation. T© these age«old battlers and\nenemies Joyce says \"harmonise your abeeedeed responses/53 That is\nto Bay, to the visual and alphabetic camp Joyce prescribes harmony,\nas to the auditory and analphabetic he prose ribas the ABC deed.\nThe return of tribalism {Finn again) and the end of civilisation\nas founded on the written word can only be avoided, said Joyce, if\nm constantly, and in all hitman affairs, translate the audible into\nthe visible, and the visible into the audible. That is the meaning\nof the Wake , ”What the reader see® is not what the reader will hear, ”\nsaid Joyce. Joyce in the Wake is the embodiment of common sense\n(the sensua coammis) whicneobatantly translate® all sense modal¬\nities into one arntfer. But in any culture with alphabet and other\ntechnologies the Mas of the culture splinters the unity of the\nsensus communis. Tet to-day our teehnolo^r has externalized all\nor our varies senses until the sensus oqsrgmmis has become a prac¬\nticality of technology and culture. Joyce nas^th© first man to\nknow this and to leap at the meanings of Wgkg. in relation to our\nopportunities to-day.\nThe Wake uses all languages (they are all mass media) and all\ntechnological media in its unity. The present writers have provided\na wonderful study tool by explaining their uses and cataloguing\ntli® thousand® of songs in Ulysses, and the Wake, pointing always to\nthe fact \"that his allusions are not all hlgKSy learned or peculiar¬\nly Irish; and that one of the most useful aid© to reading jginmjgans\nWake is the grasp of modem popular culture, such as the press,\naarortlBements, radio, low 3©2*©s, and most of all songs.”\nJoyce once said to Louis Gillet* ”je Heaima pas la musigne...\nj»aime le chant.”"
