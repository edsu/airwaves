Why has this guest been\nselected to discuss this subject?\nc) Developmental questions follow, to bring out the guest*s point of\nview.\nd) A ’’Peak Question” should be planned to be reached some ten to\neleven-and-a-half minutes into the show. This question is the cli¬\nmax, bringing about the most exciting answer.\ne) At end, the final question can provide the guest with the oppor¬\ntunity of leaving one final thought with the boys and girls in the\naudience.\n2) For a guest from a foreign land, visiting in this country, Miss Girl¬\ning recommends careful preparation of questions before he arrives at\nthe studio. If possible, do research into the current status of his\ncountry, to avoid asking meaningless questions.\n3) Brief the guest about his audience: grade level, number and kind of\nlisteners.\nh) Use rehearsal to discover new leads, and re-write questions to include\nmaterial brought up by guest. This is particularly advisable when\nusing high school students as interviewers.\n$) One effective technique is to tell guest that you are just doing a\nrun-through or dress rehearsal. Then tape it as you rehearse. If it’s\ngood enough for air use, keep it; it will often be more spontaneous\nthan the ”air show.” But remember: don*t expect all guests, particu¬\nlarly important ones, to repeat for a second time material they have\ntold you once or twice already.\n6) A technique growing in popularity, where engineering personnel and fa¬\ncilities permit, is to run an interview much longer than the time\nallotted for the actual program, and then to edit the tapes down to\nthe required timing."
