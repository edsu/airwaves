Carlisle\nDirector, Program Development\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n1345 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York City, New York 10019\nDear Bob:\nI enjoyed participating in the seminar for the fellows.\nIn my usual abrasive fashion, I Indicated some of my concerns.\nI trust you didnâ€™t mind being used as a fold.\nIn the main, CPB is doing an excellent job as it relates\nto radio. A1 Hulsen 1as been most effective in the short time\nhe has been on board.\nI do feel that the seminar was over balanced in favor of\ntelevision. And I don't really understand why. Many of the\ntopics should have been related to both media. I could nit-pick\nabout this addlnflnltura but decline to do so.\nCertainly, the radio session was no winner. I'll not try\nto analyze it - rather I'll acknowledge a failure on our part\nto stimulate any meaningful discussion.\nUndoubtedly, the corporation has an excellent program underway.\nThe need for competent manpower in our business is critical. It will\nbe interesting to see how many of the Initial group make a contribution\nin public broadcasting.\nAgain, thanks for asking me to participate.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:kh"
