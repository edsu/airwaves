  "text": "5© As to our discussion of the jurisdictional \"matter of\nfunds for In«training ptarposes: The Center originally received\nthese for use In matters which would seem to be rather obviously\nrelated to the production of programs,, Then, finding that the\nmoney was not being used up. It obtained permission to use them\nfor more general In-training purposes* It is my feeling that\nwere they to continue to obtain funds for general in-training\npurposes, whether for the setting up of seminars and $t>rkshops\nor the assignment of individual experts to stations, they would\nbe trespassing on our function as a professional organization.\nHowever, since it Is not the intension of the Center—as I\nunderstand Newburn— to ask for extensions of grants for this purpose,\nI think it entirely all right for them to use up this money for\nin-training activities, even thou$i they are doing some tilings\nrather similar to some that we may be carrying out.\nHave I sumarized our discussions adequately? Please let me\nhave your reactions, so that when we next meet we shall be able\nto start where we left off this time, rather than covering the\nsame ground again.\nI think our session with Newburn was helpful and clarifying©\nThank you all for taking the trouble and the time to attend©\nAs for expenses, incidentally, write to Harry Newburn, telling\nhim what expenses you incurred in connection with this meeting\nalone^ and he will reimburse you.\nBPrkls"
