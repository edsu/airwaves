NO. 1\nTV AND RADIO\nWORLD-WIDE ON 1141 STATIONS\nWINTER, 1955\n'Dincctrvte @olewu>t\nRemarkable Progress Highlights Closing Months of 1955\nSacred Heart-TV Programs on 40 Stations\nDear Friends:\nI think you will agree with us as you\n.read over this Winter issue of the\n“NEWS and VIEWS”—that our watch¬\nword has been progress and expansion.\nHowever, progress and expansion are\nnot always for the best. For instance,\nthe Reds are making progress with athe¬\nistic communism and are expanding their\narmed might. But the consoling part\nabout our steady development is that\nit carries forward into ever wider fields\nand more numerous channels the beauti¬\nful standard of the Sacred Heart of\nJesus. We can now say we have planted\nthat standard firmly in the world of tele¬\nvision. We are there not only to stay,\nbut to spread ever wider and wider the\nLove burning in the Sacred Heart for all\nmen—a Love that will never find its\nall-consuming flames satisfied until all\nmen are happy in this world and saved\nfor all eternity.\nFather Walter Flaherty, Director of\nRadio and TV for the Boston Archdio¬\ncese, brought out in his address at our\nannual dinner last September that if\nmen can spend hundreds of thousands\nof dollars on meaningless and puerile\nprograms, surely we can contribute pain¬\nlessly and sacrificially to the support of\na program dedicated to bringing to a\ndespairing world the solid food that\nnourishes not the body but the soul unto\nlife—unto eternal life.\nYour generosity to date has justified\nus in going ahead with the work despite\nmounting costs. We now must raise\n$900.00 every week to keep the radio and\nTV broadcasts on the air in this north-\ncontinued on Page 4)\nThe following Sacred Heart-TV schedule for this northeast area alone, shows\neffectively the advances the Program has made since its inception last June:\nWABI-TV (5) Sun. 12:45, P.M.
