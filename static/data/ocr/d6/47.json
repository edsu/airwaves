Skornia\nNAEB\n14 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nCommenting on Marcus Cohn*s letter to you of April 12\nabout the Smathers Bill (with carbons to Garnet Garrison and\nme), it is my recommendation that we have Marcus request an\nopportunity for us to appear. By ’’appear’1 I don*t mean\nnecessarily that you or I should have to go to Washington to\ntestify; it might be sufficient if we merely file some sort\nof statement with the committee, though of course counsel*s\nadvice would obtain here.\nI also think that we should, as Marcus puts it, ’’neither\nsupport nor oppose the bill, at the hearing, but should merely\nask that the bill be amended so as to exclude licensees who\nare educational institutions.”\nIn view of the fact that the May hearings will probably\ncome after our Board meeting in Columbus, I don’t think we\nneed to ask for Board approval now. We can discuss it then,\nand if they disavow us, we can withdraw (though I doubt they\nwould).\nIfpurs sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP:kls\nCC: Garnet Garrison\nMarcus Cohn\nA! ' U 1958\n1"
