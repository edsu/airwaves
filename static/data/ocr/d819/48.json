  "text": "Mr. Burton Paulu\n-2-\nDeeember 11, 1951\nElimination of WOI-TV from active membership does not serve to make\nus feel any better. The licensee is still an active member, whereas\nCornell University would lose its membership. On the other hand, if\nthe present Board feels that its action is perfectly legal, we shall\nhave no further complaint. We shall always be interested in the\nAssociation.\nIt is very difficult to believe that this change of heart on the part\nof the NAEB was not directly the cause of differences of opinion.\nWe regret that these differences have forced Cornell out of membership.\nVery truly yours,\nMichael R. Hanna\nGeneral Manager\nMRH ehc\ncc: Frank Schooley\ncci Seymour N. Siegel"
