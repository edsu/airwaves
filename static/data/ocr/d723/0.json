Such closed-\ncircuit stations are not eligible for Active membership in the NAEB, and only\nActive members are permitted to use the programs distributed by our NAEB\nNetwork via tape recordings.\nHowever, the hospital could become an Affiliate member of the NAEB and as\nsuch receive many of the publications, surveys and reports we make available\nto our members. Annual dues for Affiliate membership, including a sub¬\nscription to our monthly Newsletter are $10.\nI am also enclosing a list of materials we have available which will give\nyou an idea of the various reports and publications we issue, some of which\nhave been issued free to Affiliate members. Unfortunately, we have nothing\non closed-circuit TV which would be helpful.\nIf, after you’ve looked over these materials, you have any further questions\nabout the Association or membership in it, please let me know.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEHijy\nEnclosures"
