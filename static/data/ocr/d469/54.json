  "text": "-9-\nthe right to remove such apparatus during a ten year period following\ncompletion of the project.\nNow we come to the most critical hurdle of the entire course - Exhibit 4D\nwherein you supply your comprehensive justification of the proposed project.\nMark this one for homework - in big letters. Most of the applicants win or\nlose in the finals of this race right here. So beware of a perfunctory treat¬\nment of this Exhibit, for, very likely, it will knock your application right\nout of the running. With the severely limited funds available in fiscal ’69,\nthis Exhibit takes on even more than the usual significance (which is\nconsiderable).\nIn general, this Exhibit should include:\n(1) evidence (as the act requires) of the applicant’s comprehensive planning\nfor facilities and services (which I stressed earlier) showing how the project\nwill help the applicant make the most efficient use of the frequency assign¬\nment. /\nM;\n(2) an evaluation of the specific needs (as determined in the planning) for\nestablishment or improvement of educational radio services which your project\nis designed to fulfill.\n(3) a description of the ways in which the equipment proposed in this project\nwill meet or help to meet the above needs.\nIn preparing this Exhibit, you should give detailed attention to such\nconsiderations as, but not restricted to, the following:\n(a.) whether the-proposed project will result in the activation of a new\nstation where no such service has previously existed; or in the case of an\nexpansion project whether it will result in an increase in program service\nor audience reached or both. Include examples of existing and/or proposed\nprogram schedules, and hours per week of local programming."
