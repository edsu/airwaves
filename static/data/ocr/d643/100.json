He is less than happy with NAEB\nand seems Inclined not to renew KTCA membership\nwhen it falls due* As near as I could gather, his\nobjections are the same as those of other community\nETV members, namely that NAEB is primarily a radio\nstation organization and has little to offer TV-only\nmembers. I assured him his objection was not falling\non deaf ears and that we were in fact working toward\na solution to that feeling. I asked him to put his\nbeefs in writing and assured him I would carry them\nto the next meeting. This he agreed to do immediately\nupon his return from Duluth. I should be hearing\nfrom him before the week is out, and will provide\nyou with a copy of his protests if you wish.\nAt the moment it looks like we might have another\nPittsburgh situation on our hands. I think we\nshould do everything within our power to avoid it.\nSince this one is in your backyard, you probably\nhave a good deal more information on it than I do.\nI would appreciate any filling-in you can give me.\n1*11 be happy to carry the ball on it, especially\nif it will relieve you of possible local embarrassment.***\nBest regards,\ns/ Dick\nRichard P. Vogl\nDirector, Region IV\nRFVset\ncc* Dr. Harry J. Skornia"
