Both were rated at 150 watts peak output and both\nhad built-in sweep generators for alignment. The ACL transmitters were physically\nlarger than the Dage transmitter. However, the VHF model sells for $7,500, and\nthe UHF for $13,885. These prices, of course, do not include'accessories.\nAnother feature of the ACL transmitter was the fact that the audio and\nvideo signals were amplified by a common amplifier and thus oily one coaxial\nfeed to the antenna is required; whereas, the Dage equipment requires two coaxial\nfeed lines - one for the aural and one for the video. ACL transmitters have both\nbuilt in picture and sound monitoring equipment, plus an audio tone generator for\ntest purposes or for use behind a test pattern.
