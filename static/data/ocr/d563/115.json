This mushrooming growth\nof instructional television has created a tremendous demand for\npersonnel qualified to utilise the medium properly for instructional\npurposes. The number of teachers and production personnel so trained\nis woefully inadequate* and this shortage has resulted in a crisis\nnot unlike the teacher-training criele of the 195Q’s.\nThe qualitative aspects are even lees encouraging. There are\nmany Individuals performing essential tahks at all levels in\ninstructional television whose preparation has boos inadequate. This\nfact does not constitute an indictment of the Individuals concerned\nnor of the institutions which trained them. Rather* it is merely\nsymptomatic of the extremely rapid application of a familiar medium\nia aa unfamiliar context. Thus one find individuals with sound\npreparation la all aspects of broadcasting and tbs development ef\nprogramming for mass audiences who have little familiarity with\npedagogy or the psychology of learning upon which the success of their\nefforts ultimately depends.\nConversely many educators who are heavily involved la\ninstructional television have so specific understanding of the art\nsad craft of orgaaisatloa of course content and its specific appliostios\nto the media for systematic learning."
