We are not requesting NAEB sponsorship\nor funds* If the conference is successful, however, we hope to make\na transcript of the proceedings which should be of benefit to all\nmember stations*\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Harold Hill and trust he will\ncomment as well* Any suggestions, recommendations, or even outcries of\nhorror, will be given the usual careful consideration*\nCordially,\nE.G* Burrows\nManager, WUOM"
