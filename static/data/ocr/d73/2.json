Harley\n- 2 -\nJanuary 16* 1962\nIn view of this development* I feel that I am in no position\nto engage in any further promotional activity of a money-raising nature\nwith respect to the Director of Development project. I still feel* how¬\never, that NAJSB is the logical group to “spearhead” the ETV movement*\nand would welcome opportunities to participate actively in its work.\nWhile my staff and I cannot serve as financial “angels”* we may be able\nto contribute time or talents that will help the cause in which we all\nbelieve.\nSincerely yours*\nJWW/scc\nJohn W. Wentworth\nManager,\nEducational Electronics"
