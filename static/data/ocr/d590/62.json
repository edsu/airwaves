The FCC through its licensing pro¬\ncedure for both radio and television broadcasting stations sets standards\nfor good engineering practice; however no standards exist for non-broadcast\nequipment in these fields. This project would contribute greatly to the\nestablishment of such standards.\nIV. Other Related Research. A number of books have been published on radio\nand television equipment. However most of these cover technical aspects\nof the equipment and do not provide data on costs or specific installations >\nMost technical society journals also cover design considerations of equip¬\nment. While some information has been published in educational journals ,\nthe best source on specific installations is ’’Broadcast News’1, a promotional\npublication of an equipment manufacturer. As a result of this lack of da+a\nin objective, non-technical form, most institutions contemplating entering\nfoe field send a representative to visit one or more operating installation-.’,\nand with the assistance of equipment catalogs, plan their own plant. Floor\nIans, block diagrams, and schematics of existing installations based on\nmlid experimentation and evaluation, as proposed her , would o;;:co singly\nh -upful tc them in making such plans."
