This allows for greater flexibility and does\naway with the impossible situations involved in the ttbicycleM\nmethod*\n(2) We will hold the first seminar devoted to consideraÂ¬\ntion of the role of broadcasting by the public schools.\n(3) We will hold two more regional conferences. This\nenables us to take the most advanced knowledge on educational\nbroadcasting directly to the small broadcasters and school systems.\n(h) We will have a more effective central office in a\nbetter position to serve educational broadcasters generally and to\nfocus and unify the exciting activities now under way.\n(5) We will have the opportunity for work groups and\nNAEB committees to meet occasionally and restudy the problensbe-\nfore educational broadcasters and the proper functioning of the\nnational organization and its programs. Certain plans for this\ntype of study are now under way. NAEB officers will undoubtedly\nwish to talk to the Foundation in more detail about this later."
