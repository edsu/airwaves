Assoc, of Educational Broadcasters\n119 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nSeveral days ago you sent me a statement on\nNovik's services -which you planned to forward to your members.\nI believe you requested my reaction and I\nregret that I am rather tardy with it. Your statement seemed\nfine to me and I have nothing to suggest.\nI hope to send you further word in a day or\ntwo as to whether your observations on the scope of Mr. Novik’s\nactivities call for any modification in the wording of the grant\nletter; however I am inclined to doubt it.\nMy very best.\nSincerely yours.\nGHG:EH\nG. H. Griffiths"
