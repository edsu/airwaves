Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational\n1346 Connecticut Avenue\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nBroadcasters\nDear Bill:\nAlthough we've already spoken of the matter, I want\nto take this opportunity to put on paper my feelings about the\nimportance of the Programs for the Disadvantaged project which\nKen Clark has so ably handled.\nEach week, when I get Ken's radio and television re¬\nports, I am pleased again at how much programming for the rural\nand urban poor educational broadcasters have developed. It makes\nme proud to be a part of the field.\nThe important and necessary service which the project\nprovides, however, is not merely to document that we are doing a\nbetter job of discharging our public responsibilities than we might\nhave suspected. A great deal of what is going on has been developed\nat the grass roots level. (If Commissioners Johnson and Cox had\nfound that kind of local programming in Oklahoma their reactions\nmight have been different.) It's vital that all educational broad¬\ncasters find out what their colleagues are really doing, not only\nbecause that can make possible the exchange of good programs, but\nbecause it provides the challenge and inspiration for other broad¬\ncasters - commercial as well as noncommercial - to do likewise.\nMany of educational broadcasting's critics claim that\nwe are more \"educated\" than \"educational,\" only programming for\nother \"egg heads.\" Ken's work gives them the lie, and inspires\nus all to serve minorities other than the one we happen to belong\nto."
