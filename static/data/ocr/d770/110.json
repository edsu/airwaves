SYDNEY\n12 January, 1968.\nABU MEMBERS\nRESOLUTIONS OF 1HE ABU FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY\nAt Hie closing plenary session of the ABUrs Fourth General Assembly in\nSingapore, the General Assembly adopted the recommendations that had\nbeen made by the five Committees but time was not then available to put\nthese decisions into the form of resolutions. It was therefore agreed\nthat I would prepare the resolutions later, being careful to retain the\nmeaning of the recommendations that had been adopted.but using the\nappropriate phraseology for formal resolutions, particularly in the\ndecisions which need to be sent to organisations outside the ABU.\nCopies of the Resolutions, as now completed, and the minutes of the\nclosing plenary session are attached. The figure f4f at the beginning\nof the number of each resolution is intended as a method of identifying\nthe decision concerned as having been made at Hie Fourth General Assembly.\nAs in previous years, the minutes of the closing plenary session will be\nsubmitted for confirmation at the opening plenary session of the next\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe Secretariat is now working on the printed Proceedings of the Fourth\nGeneral Assembly, with the intention that this permanent record of the\nmeeting should be available to all members as soon as possible. In the\nmeantime, the Resolutions and minutes attached will be a useful summary,\nfor the officers of your organisation, of the decisions made at our last\nGeneral Assembly.\nCHARLES MOSES-.-\nSecretary-General."
