I cannot help but feel that Graham Rovey ia a \"doubly good\"\nproduct of a good idea. He's a good U.S.A. representative in Italy* he's doing\nan especially good Job in creating a better understanding of Italy in the U.S.A.\n\"WILL has received a number of comments on the aeries of programs, according\nto our mail count record, but m do not have them in file or I'd transmit copies\nof some of them to you, along with ay remarks.\"\nSincerely yours,\n/«/ Prank I.
