  "text": "-2-\nDirector will have some ideas too, but we should have\ncleared our own thinking before even looking for a man*\n5) Have you seen that material corning out of Mich. State,\nthe AGRISEARCH papers? Are we thinking in terms of this\nsort of material* If so, how can we avoid duplication?\nHow may we cooperate, if they want to?\n6) What are we facing in trying to fill the position of the\nDirector? Granted he should have all of the virtues of\nthe President of Harvard, Harry Skoraia, and Burton Paulu,\nrolled into one, but a) are we to look for him, b) or is\nthis being presumptuous and a matter of Hqs. doing it?\nAs 1 have previously pointed out I hope we aren't thinking\nin terms of the average faculty salary for this position*\nIf he is to move to Urbana we should think in terms of\nmaking it worthwhile enough to attract only the best in\nthis field. Then, too, it goes without saying that the position\ncalls for a man who intends to stay with it for at least\nfive years, perhaps ten or more*\n7) Are we to start thinking that this position should be filled\nby July 1, perhaps Sept. 1 at the latest?\nThe more questions I keep thinking about the more I am wondering if Hqs.\nwon't approve a meeting for us at Columbus this spring? Perhaps you\nhave already checked on this, but if we can't get together then, what\ndo you suggest?\nA happy Easter to you and the family.\nCordially,\nRaymond D. Cheydleur\nAssistant Director"
