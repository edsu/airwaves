Often\nthe more general terms indicate that the laboratory contains all kinds of\nteaching materials rather than audio-visual materials alone.\nSpace and Facilities\nIn institutions with a small enrollment in teacher education* the teaching\nmaterials center may be an integral part of the audio-visual center. In larger\nteacher education institutions, the teaching materials center is more apt to\nbe an integral part of the school or college of education* Often the center\nis administered by the same people who teach the audio-visual courses.\nIn its simplest form* the teaching materials center is a flexible, expanded*\ndemonstration classroom unit, equipped with the latest teaching materials and\nequipment and with a professional library. It should be capable of being re¬\nvised, and if necessary* remodeled as new needs* theories* and devices appear.\nA suggested list of materials and equipment for A? demonstration centers with\n$1000, $£000, and $10*000 budgets is given in Appendix D.\nIllustrations and brief statements of purposes* spaces* and facilities\nare given for five sample teaching materials centers.
