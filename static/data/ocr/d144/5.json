As\nsomewhat of a coincidence, I think, I am engaged this quarter in setting up\na public relations program for WKAR as part of a \"special problems\" course\nI am taking. However, I had never seriously considered undertaking a simi¬\nlar project for educational television until you mentioned this possibility.\nI also had doubts about the survey approach to my study, realizing quite\nwell the attitude people have toward questionnaires'. I do believe that I\nwould at least like to sample some of the things people in the industry\nsay they are doing about PR, but perhaps I may be able to do this on a more\nlimited scale than I had anticipated if I also include a proposed PR pro¬\ngram in the study.\nAs you can see, I'm still in the \"thinking\" stage on this project, and that\nis why I have found your suggestions so valuable. Incidentally, I have been\nusing the NALB PUBLIC RELATIONS KIT as an aid in setting up the WKAR pro¬\nposed program.\nThanks again for your interest and assistance.\nSincerely yours.\nR,\nA< ^ _ .on Director"
