Surveys #1 and #2 indicated that of this 7$, approximately 10% were\nlistening to WOIJI. Survey #3, taken after the establishment of the\nAM transmitter, showed that approximately 85$ were listening to\nWOUB, This was a c onsiderable increase over the previous two\nsurveys. It can be assumed that the increase was due in part to the\nability of the listener to receive a more strongly transmitted\nradio signal than \"rom any of the other radio stations reaching this\narea. Other elements that might have influenced this statistic were;\n(1) the novelty of a new station being in the area, (2) acceptaoility\nof the programming, (3) interest of a college community in the\nbroadcasting of a University radio station*\nII*\nA, Approximately 38$ of the sample of surveys #1 and #2 had listened\nto WOUI at some time* This figure increased to 72$ for survey #3*\nIt is also assumed that the reasons stated in part B of conclusion\nI would also apply in this case*"
