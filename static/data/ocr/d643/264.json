Perhaps the whole point is\nthat the expression, Independent Television Authority, sounds\nbetter than. Commercial Television Authority,\nThe basic structure of the ITA is unique in the whole world.\nSince it grew out of a desire to avoid the very problems we are\nencountering right now, it is worthy of our careful attention.\nThe Television Act was passed by Parliament in July 1954,\nafter long and heated debate, in the course of which great doubts\nwere expressed about commercial television. The critics had in\nmind the BBC»s tradition of excellent public service programming;\nthey were afraid that in a commercial system, advertisers would\ncontrol the programs; they thought that competition might lead\nto a lowering of standards, in the inevitable competition for\naudiences; and they were sure that competition would result in\nthe neglect of minority interests 0\nTherefore, they came up with a new pattern, the basic\nfeature of which was the separation of responsibility for program\ncontent and advertising. The model for the ITA was the press,\nin which news and editorial columns are kept entirely separate\nfrom advertising copy, rather than American commercial broadcasting,\nin which advertisers often provide programs, or at least participate\nin their development. The director-general of the ITA calls\nthis, ’’editorial television,” and I think the tern is a good one.\nIndependent television falls into three divisions.* the\nIndependent Television Authority itself; the progran companies;\nand the advertisers and advertising agencies.\n-5-"
