C.\nDear Dr. K or berg:\nAs the definition becomes clearer regarding which of the projects under\nTitle VII will be handled on a contract basis, and which on a grant\nbasis, it appears that all or most of the three proposals we have so\nfar submitted might possibly fall into the contractual area.\nIf that is the case, we should like to have our grant application bud¬\ngets disregarded in order to enable us to begin anew to conform to the\nnew approaches and limitations which are beginning to emerge and to\ndiscuss contract possibilities on a wholly new basis when this becomes\ndesirable. This is not a request for removal of oar grant requests from\nthe file, of course, until a final decision is made that these functions\nwill definitely be carried on only on a contract basis.\nWe should also like to request particularly that, in any contractual\nconsideration, our statements as contained in our October 24, 1958\nproposal and the statement of \"The Training Program of the NAEB* *\n(copies attached) as sent you earlier be given careful consideration\nas succinct, summaries of our credentials, particularly in the research,\nclearing house and teacher-training areas. We believe they are essen¬\ntial for the information of those who make contractee selections\nThis letter is prompted by discussions with Mr. Stardahl and others\nwhen I was in Washington for the recent meeting of representatives of\nthe organisations most concerned with dissemination problems in\nconnection with the Act, and by the new definitions and clarifications,\nnow emerging, which we of course did not have at the time these re¬\nquests were submitted."
