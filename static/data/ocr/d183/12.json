The Federal Security Agency; the Mutual Security\nAgency; the Armed Forces of the United States;*the United Nations;\nUNESCOj commercial stations and networks; private foundations; and other\npublic service agencies® The programs have been concerned with many\nimportant subject areas and were presented in numerous formats®\nThe percent of stations us5.ng regular program series has run from\na low of 20$ to a high of 100$ with an average percentage of use of 66%«\nThis is an encouragingly high percentage in view of the fact that use\nis entirely optional on the part of the station® No effort is made to\nincrease the usage of programs except to select programs of continually*\nhigher quality® This use of the network service has also been achieved\nwith a distrlbutlon system that can not guarantee a regular delivery' of\ntapes on a sufficiently safe basis to insure complete regularity of\nscheduling® This bodes well for the network9s future®\nTOWARD A SOLUTION OF SOME PROBLEMS\nTwo important steps were taken during the past year to help solve\nsome of the network*s most pressing problems®\nIn January there mat in Urbana a group of engineers and invited\nelectronics specialists® This group was concerned with the technical\nproblems of tape recording and the mass reproduction of tapes® Tape\nrecording is such a new process that the extant technical standards\nare incompleteo Thus it became obvious that technical standards would\nhave to be devised by our own members® A preliminary report was submitted*\nThe standards are now being revised and will soon be published as a\ntechnical guide for the entire network operation®\nIn February there met in Lafayette, Indiana the Tape Network\nProgram Acceptance Committee and the In-School Programs Committee® These\ncommittees were confronted with the problem of establishing policies and\nevaluative criteria for programming the network® A greatly increased\nmutuality of thinking on the subject of programs resulted® A report of\nthese findings was published for the information of all rasher stations®\nThe In-School Programs Committee took further action in implementing an\nactive distribution of programs designed for classroom use in elementary\nand secondary schools® This distribution is now a successfuly reality®\nTHE OPERATION\nAt this writing the network is still required to operate on a\n^bicycle** basis© This method of distribution is incapable of adequately\nserving the member eta tier©® Such success as the network has experienced\nhas been achieved in spite of this method® It has been impossible to\nabandon the ^bicycle* without a mass duplicating machine® Delivery of\nsuch a machine is new assured®\nThe network has acquired approximately £,200 reels of magnetic ta$a0\nThis has allowed an ever expanding program service* It is anticipated\nthat approximately IG.,000 reels will be required to keep the operation\nrunning at peak efficiency*"
