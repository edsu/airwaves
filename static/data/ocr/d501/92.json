For my taste, it sounds very\ninteresting and worthwhile, but I have some reservations about\nputting it on the air until we know a bit more about it.\nAn audition tape would be helpful, I think, and an expanded\noutline of each program. The notes you sent are too sketchy;\nbooks could be written about each item and have been written about\nseveral of them. We would need an examination and opinion of\nphilosophical scholars to reach a good decision; and I am not\nqualified in that manner.\nTo sum up, I think the idea has much promise, but needs to\nbe explored much further by people who know the history of\nphilosophical thought, I approve of the 15 minute program\nformat, since we need more shorter programs for our schedules.\nSincerely,\nKenneth D. Wright\nDirector of Broadcasting"
