In other words develop a standard nation-wide radio e•valuation sheet to\nbe filled in by users as a guide to producers if they wish to meet the needs of in¬\nschool listeners,\n2» We are also in need of a catalog of single radio broadcasts, properly\nevaluated, with subject matter and grade level classification*, These programs to\nbe made available through duplication to schools for classroom use from tape play¬\nback.\n*##\nWBTR\nKathleen No Lardie\n1.
