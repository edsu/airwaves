Every normal human being over the age of two\ncan express his feelings and thoughts by the use of language. But the way in which\niHngimgP works for different people varies. It is different not only from one\ncountry to another, but also from one generation to the next; from one job to the\nnext; from one social situation to the next. Our purpose in the discussion follow¬\ning the first program is to find out how language serves us here in our own\nlocality.\nMan is the only animal with language. No other animal can speak; no other\nauthentic case of true speech has ever been found. Parrots imitate intricate\nsounds but they cannot express their own ideas. Other animals can express feelings -\nthe mating-call of the moose or the warning cry of the mother quail. But they can¬\nnot talk about the past or future, or express ideas. It is these things that make\nhuman speech different from animal cries.\nLanguage helps make possible the wonderful world that all men live in. This\nis the world enriched by the tools he has made, the stories he tells, the knowl¬\nedge he has accumulated, the ideas, the dreams. These could not be passed on from\nparent to child if we could not speak.\nLanguage is a fascinating subject. There is first of all the difference in\nlanguage from one place to another, something every traveler comes to realize.\nLanguage is also different from one time in history to another — as one\nrealizes when reading the kinds of letters that American soldiers in the Revo¬\nlutionary War wrote as compared to the letters written by American soldiers in\nWorld War II.\nThe kind of language you use also changes with the occasion. Do you use the\nExperimental Discussion Program Subject to Revision\n5"
