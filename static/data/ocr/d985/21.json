Regarding the attached\nTaking up Adkins' recommendations, point by point:\n1 - Sounds good, but if your luc& at getting members to do the job is any indication, this\nwon't work out very well. Might be a good idea to ask Burton to make the Research\ncommittee larger and add people that you know can do this kind of work and then make it\nclear that preparation of Fact Sheets will be one of the primary functions of the committee,\n2 - Can't afford to do this under present circumstances. As you suggest, this might be\ndone in cooperation with the Institute of Comm. Res. Certainly wouldn't hurt anything\nto talk to Fred. As I remember, they were actually looking for projects a few months\nago.\n3 - Agree this is a wornderful idea, but I'm not sure it's the thing we need the worst.\nThere are other areas in which we could use an extra person which might pay off even\nbetter in the long run. However, I'm certainly not adverse to asking for money for this\nif it seems that we might do some good."
