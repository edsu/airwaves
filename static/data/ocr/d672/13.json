  "text": "Ml of the RF stages, save for the final PA, are frequency multi¬\npliers, Thus, only the final 4-250A tube requires neutralization.\nTen Watts of RF drive are available but only a small portion of\nthis drive is required to obtain rated power.\nThe final 4-250A is operated very conservatively and exceptional\ntube lite should be expected.\nAll circuits of the FM-250A can be tuned from the front panel.\nThis ease of tuning plus the accessibility of meters for every RF circui\npermits ease of operation; maintenance and technical analysis.\nOnly one switch is required to operate the transmitter but inde¬\npendent controls are available to operate the exciter and PA units inde¬\npendently. Time delay and overload units adequately protect the trans¬\nmitter. This simplicity in controls permits the use of an inexpensive\naccessory kit for achieving remote control of the FM-250A.\nA test switch is provided which permits the operator to make re¬\nadjustments to the equipment under low P.A. plate voltage conditions.\nThis feature reduces the possibility of damage during initial tuning up\nperiod.\nMECHANICAL\nThe FM-250A is self contained in an attractive custom cabinet.\nThe entire unit is only 68 5/8” high.\nIt requires only the addition of tubes, crystal, audio input and\npower input lines to begin operation.\nSPECIFICATIONS\nPerformance Specifications\nFM\n88 to 103 MC\nType of Emission\nFrequency Range\nRated Power Output\n250 watts"
