Games are\ngames, work is work, and learning is learning.\nThat learning is work comes closer to their\nunderstanding than gaming is learning. So, at\nleast with this population, the newer methods of\neducational technology are less applicable, less\nmeaningful as experience.\nWe do not mean to imply by the foregoing that we\nshould not relate to advanced technology. What\nwe do insist on is that innovation relate meaningÂ¬\nfully to those frames of reference within which\nthe poverty population operates. To structure\narbitrarily, outside of those parameters, is to\ninvite disaster for the whole idea.\nSince we are dealing with television programs,\nthese should be developed within the confines\nof readable disciplines, and get at some new\n(or not so new) ideas about how people learn.\nPeople learn well in groups because they have\nthe opportunity to draw on each others'\nexperiences, each others' failures, and each\nothers' successes, as has been mentioned before."
