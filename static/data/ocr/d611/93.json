  "text": "To discuss communications in relationship to Nationhood would\nagain prompt us to define a state of nationhood. While I will attempt\nto avoid the phi 1osophical and intellectual rhetoric, I will perhaps\nlean toward the understanding that the geographic locations of the\nBlack nation in America is anyplace there is a lar^e concentration of\nClack people. The point I will stress as a personal opinion is that\nthe critical area of nationhood and the area we «.iust deal with on an\nurgent basis is the “state of mind\".\nGiven the fact that as a group of people we occupy large cru¬\ncial sections of this country, it is unfortunate that we do not control\nthem. The absolute need for self-government of these areas and the\ncontrol of the power, wealth, and resources will only be met providing\nwe develop a basic concept of ourselves! This position demands that we\nsee and clearly understand the problem. Itfs not just political, econ¬\nomic, or cultural, but the entire abuse of humanity. I would further\nsubmit, that as someone once.skid, “Freedom is a state of mind\". Until\nwe, as a beautiful race of people who have survived impossible condi¬\ntions and oppression can absolutely perceive ourselves as not being\nunderprivileged, wretched, psychologically ill-equipped, etc., etc,,\netc.,etc., we cannot even begin to develop a nationhood. To underscore\nthis I would submit that the primary solution to achieving nationhood\nis the establishment of communication and agreement among Black people,\nfor the purpose of achieving.••••.a universal “Black State of Mind\".\nThis is made evident by the fact that a large segment of the\nBlack community has been brainwashed into accepting the white America^\ncharacterization of the revolution. This in turn, has often led to\nconflict, name-calling and in sane cases, being at ‘war with ourselves.\n>3-"
