May your light shine on!\nThe materials you sent on to us are exactly what we needled.\nHowever, we’re advised to includ^e with our appeal a statement\nof the actual defense act as relating to Title 7. My own copies\nhave been cleared out of the files.Could you please send us\ntwo or three copies of the Act itself. So far as I know,\nno Canadian has ever before had any relationship with the\nU.S. Office of Education. My case ,therefore, represents a\nprecedent for the Dept of Internal Revenue here, and need^s to\nbe handled with great thoroughness.\nI hope I need not say how extremely valuable in terms of discovery\nand insight our Project 69 proved to be. If I can trust the\nreactions of people like For^sdale and Foshay^ and others our\nlil ol’ report on Understanding Media will not go unnoticed .\nForesdale says,nIt turns Ed gar Dale’s Cone of Experience\nthe other way up! Edgar Dale was wrong.n\nCordial best regards to you and my other friends at Gregory Hall."
