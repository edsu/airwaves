We still have five on which to take\naction®\nThough the total actions of the subcommittee\nhave been nearly unanimous, it should be noted that\nunanimity in voting for approval or rejection has\nnot been nearly so prevalent® There have been many\ntwo-to-one votes, for or against.\nUnfortunately, I doubt that I will be at\nColumbus. To latch onto the phrase of one ofthe\nmore revered members, ’’we're pore folks down here,\"\nand it looks as if our budget has expired.\nSincerely yours.\n,/acTk Westbrook (WUOT)\nChairman\nNetwork Acceptance\nCC: Waldo Abbot\nSubcommittee"
