  "text": ".history was made in educational broadcasting.”\nThese were the words John Dunn, Director of NAEB Region V, used\nto describe the first regional conference in NAEB history. This\nconference was a long dreamed of high point of the past year for\nNAEB. It was finally possible this year under terms of the grant\nfrom the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.\nRegion V of NAEB is composed of the s tates of Missouri,\nKansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, and Louisi¬\nana. This land of wide open spaces was also a land of great dis¬\ntances between educational broadcasters. Jfeny of the people who\nfound it possible to attend this conference with Foundation help\nhad in the past literally never talked to another person engaged in\neducational broadcasting. Who then could better counsel these people\nthan practical educational broadcasters? It was therefore logical\nthat the national officers of NAEB, all practical educational broad¬\ncasters, be chosen as the consultants for this meeting.\nThe results will be felt for a long time. Immediately\nthey can best be summed up by quoting two paragraphs from the report\nof John Dunn, who originally fathered the idea of regional divisions\nof NAEB and who sparkplugged this meeting.\n”REGIONALLY, I believe that Region V, for the first time,\nhas a deeper respect for and understanding of the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters than even before;\nregional members know their national officers and are\ngreatly impressed with their ability; regional members\nknow each other in a truly personal way, regional members\nrealize that others have problems sometimes greater than\ntheir own; regional members are willing to help others so\nfar as it is in their ability in the solution of problems;\nregional members are truly inspired to do bigger and better\nthings in educational broadcasting."
