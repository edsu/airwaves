Gans\nSecretary\nNAEB\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear 'Mrs. Gans:\n4fc\n■ **\n%\n?**•*, s\nIn reference to your letter of April Sth to Mr. John\nCarnbus our Station Manager at WDET, let me say that I\nhave not as yet seen a bill for the NAEB-TV Research\nFactsheet and will be most happy to pay same if I know\nhow much I owe you.\n(I\nAs I understand the note at the bottom of the\nletter, our material from the NAEB is now being add¬\nressed to John Carnbus our Station Manager. If the\nNAEB wants a single name for all material then this\nsituation should remain as is since we are most con¬\ncerned that the tape network material get to Carnbus\ndirectly. If it is possible to have material sent\n-isut to two different people at the same institution,\nthen I would like such things as the NAEB-TV Research\nFactsheets, the Newsletter or anything which does not\ndeal directly with the operation of the network and the\nradio station to be sent to me.\nLee S. Dreyfus /^\nAssistant Directpr*/\nRadio and Television\nLSD:pb\ncc: John Carnbus\nV- t5-S7"
