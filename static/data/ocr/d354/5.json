K. KELLOGG FOUNDATION, as forwarded on June 22. In it will be found a\nfuller and more adequate expression of the fine relationship which exists between\nour two organizations, and a statement of some of the plans of the NAEB for the more\nadequate publicizing and distribution of the results of our common efforts.\nIt is our hope that the record of accomplishment which emerges from these com¬\nbined reports may be the source of as much satisfaction to the W. K. KELLOGG FOUNDA¬\nTION as to the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, whose sincere\nthanks are hereby most sincerely expressed.\nRespectfully submitted\nfor the NAEB President\nand Board\nH. J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nJuly 26, 1954"
