The NAEB is educational broadcast\ning, and no amount of service the NBTRC can perform can eliminate the\nabsolute necessity of NAEB.\nFinally, I feel that this is a time for leadership by the NAEB\nofficers and board. We must first find areas of agreement satis¬\nfactory to us and to the NETRC people. Then, if our decisions are\nsound, ve can and must persuade the NAEB membership to accept them.\nTo that end, we must approach the coming board meeting in a splr\nit of friendship and reasonableness, with recognition that there is\na job to be done and with determination to start it. Dissent on\nsome points may be necessary and helpful, but deliberate obstruction¬\nism for its own sake, or a closed mind, can help nobody.\nLooking forward to seeing you and working with you at Columbus.\nSincerely,\nKen Kager\nRadio Director, VI\nKK:mn\ncc: Harold Hill\nDick Hull"
