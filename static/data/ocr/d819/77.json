  "text": "WILL JOBES* COLUMN\nMinneapolis Morning Tribune\nSept. 11, 1952\nClaude Sains plays Thomas Jefferson In a fascinating nms series of\nradio dramas, \"She Jeffersonian Heritage.\" The series, which starts next\nTuesday at 1«30 p*ra. on KUQM, uses Jefferson’s writings as a springboard\nfor some pretty imaginative radio essays on freedom.\nIn the second program, for Instance, Jefferson gets involved in a\nposthumous argument with a Russian commissar. The commissar quotes\nJefferson on revolution to prove that the American patriot would have\napproved of the Russian revolution.\nJefferson quotes Jefferson further to prove that he wouldn't have\ndone any such thing. After casing the first two programs at a preview\nhearing, I'd recommend tuning in.\nThe 13 recorded dramas were produced by the National Association of\nEducation el Broadcasters with funds provided by the Ford foundation. They\nmake their bow on educational radio stations next week. Later they may\nbe heard on commercial stations and networks.\nMeanwhile, with the Jefferson series finished, the same groups are\nat work on two more aeriesi \"People Under Communism,\" a draaa series on\nlife in Russia, and \"The Ways of Mankind,\" dramas based on anthropological\nstudies.\n* * * «"
