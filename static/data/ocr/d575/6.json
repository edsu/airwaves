Burrows\nWUOM\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nDear Ed:\nYes, I plan on attending the NAEB Convention and should be at the Radio\nNetwork Program Committee meeting.\nYour question reminded me that I regretfully had not answered your memo\nof July 13 requesting comments on the award to a NAEB Network station.\nMy delay in answering your memo embarrasses me, and I hope the following\ncomments are helpful and not too late.\nSince the award will go to a \"network\" station, it seems logical that the\naward for \"outstanding contribution\" should be for a network activity,\nrather than a broad service activity to the NAEB ancj/or to the broad¬\ncasting industry. Your listing of the criteria on which an award should\nbe made, points up the difficulty in choosing a set of rules. All sorts of\npossibilities and problems arise — awards for best series, one with grant-\nin-aid, one without — total number of series, but this does not take\n\"facilities available\" into account — who is to judge the award and how —\nand many more that I am sure you have thought of.\nI really wonder what useful purpose will be served with yet another award,\nto say nothing of the machinery that would be required to make the selection.\nThe folder in my file labeled \"Awards and Citations\" is 3 inches thick, and\nI hardly have time to keep up with them all. I don't think we need another.\nWhy not make the Ohio State Awards a combined NAEB-IERT award?\nHarold W. Roeth\nProgram Manager\nHWRrwIp\nThe non-commercial Metropolitan FM station of The Riverside Church in the City of New York"
