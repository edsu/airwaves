At these earlier stages, he can interpret them for\nthe Title VII committee to insure getting money for the latter stages\nof the project. I am not sure that this money will be forthcoming if\nit depends upon Mac communicating to Walter Stone, Dick Hull, et al.\nFor one thing, I do not think he will try very hard. In the second\nplace, I am not at all sure that he would succeed if he did try.\nOn a completely different subject, a suggestion for the NAEB\nJournal. I have suggested to a number of people that they send papers\nwhich they showed me to the Journal. However, if we want the good\npeople to keep contributing, I believe that the editorial staff needs\nto observe certain courtesies recognized by most journals. First of\nall, the editor needs to let the author know whether or not the paper\nhas been accepted. Secondly, the author should see page proofs before\nthey are published. Third, he should receive a few reprints and, prior\nto publication, should have the opportunity to order more if he wishes.\nThis came home to me recently because I just discovered that they had\npublished a paper of mine six months or so ago and I never knew it.\nIt does not matter in my case since I am one of the family but it will\nmake quite a difference for most of the people whom we want to publish\nthere. Hope that this can be taken care of. I realize the tremendous\nproblems under which the Journal staff operates. Nonetheless, these\nare things which must be done if a really good Journal is to be developed.\nHope all is well with you.\nBest\nSamuel L. Becker\nChairman, NAEB\nResearch Committee\nSLB: mw"
