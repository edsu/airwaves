As\nI recall it* one of Scott Fletcher*s original ideas was that this\ncommittee would meet* among other times, just prior to Center Board\nmeetings* to make proposals to the President for consideration by\nthe Board. This may or may not be feasible as things have developed\nin the Center, but this is at least one of the possibilities we\nmight consider. In any event, when we do meet, I suggest the\ncommittee convene for a day or so by itself, and subsequently\nconferring with you and other members of the Center. In that way\nwe could organize a presentation which would be more helpful to\nyou, and also could better react to your questions and proposals\nto us\nHay I hear from you at your convenience? X want to make the\nETRC-NAEB relationships as close and mutually helpful as possible.\nWith best personal regards,\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP sit\nCCs Members NAEB Advisory Committee\nto the President of the ETRC"
