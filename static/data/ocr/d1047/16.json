He\nhas energy and enthusiasm and an appropriate set of\nvalues with which to direct them. I recall that he\nhad ideas and ability to follow them through, working\nindependently.\nBob is a likeable chap, who gets along well with\nothers, and is a thoroughly agreeable sort that\nallows him to fit in most anywhere.\nI know nothing first hand of his competence as a TV\nproducer etc., though his record certainly looks\nImpressive. I do know that you can count on him as\na person, as a man of integrity and idealism. And\nwhen he says he has decided to go into ETV as the\nplace to \"excell and work creatively and satisfyingly\",\nhe sincerely means it.\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley\nWGH:mem\nP. S.
