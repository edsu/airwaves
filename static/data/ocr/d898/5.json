Mott\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D. C. 20036\nDear Mr. Mott:\nI was sorry to have missed you and Cindy when I attended\nthe IBS convention in Washington. I hoped to be able to go over\nthe College Radio Study questionnaire with you then, but since the\nstudy started late, and the end of the school year is approaching,\nI have had to rush to get it in the mail as soon as possible. I am\nenclosing a few copies, and would like very much to hear your opinion\nof it.\nI have sent the questionnaire to about 400 carrier-current\nand commercial college and university stations, and to about 350\nnoncommercial stations licensed to colleges and universities. I\ndon't know what the final response will be, but today I received a\nfirst return of over fifty questionnaires. I hope it keeps up.\nThe IBS convention was sometimes confused, and even the\nofficers agree that IBS is a shadowy and elusive entity. I gather\nthis stems in large part from a very low budget. But I found the\nofficers and members helpful and interested in the study, and am\nlooking forward to working with them.\nMy plan is to supplement the questionnaire with interviews\nand other contacts with people in broadcasting and broadcast\nadvertising, and anybody else who can help. I hope to be in touch\nwith you very shortly, and perhaps I can manage to get to Washington\nagain before June 15, my deadline.\nSincerely,\nVMB:dlb\nEnclosures\nAn independent study under grants from\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting and The Ford Foundation"
