Schooley, President\nnational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nlit Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Franks\nThank you for your speech comment on the JCET deal with Old Dominion.\nYour reaction is the same as my own, and the project is not one which\nwould justify a protest from either NAEB or the Center. I had approved\nthe approach to the Foundation by telephone and was given some assurance\nat the time that the request would be granted.\nAs to JCET operating in pilot-study areas only, if the organization is\nable to get money, it will go into program production, on whatever level\npossible and there will be only one vote in the organization against\nsuch a move.\nUnless NAEB can secure special grants to underwrite, or produce directly,\nTV programs in some special category which might be approved by the\nCenter, thereby staking out that field in effect, JCET can be expected\nto continue to try to get into the actual production for distribution\nbusiness. Only a weakening of support, to the extent of reducing the\norganization to a shoe string operation, will keep Dave and Ralph from\nhinting up every foundation in the country for money for production but\nwe can talk about that later.\nIf you have not already done so, I suggest that you notify Newburn of\nthe change in the personnel of the Advisory Committee to the President\nof the Center, including the change in chairmanship. Then, I think you\nshould request a meeting of the advisory Committee with Newburn to discuss\nseveral things, including;\n1. Assessment fee rate.\n2. Fuller utilization of the Advisory Committee or other\ncommittees in determining Center program policies and\nprogram selection.\n3. Coordination of information channels between NAEB and\nthe Center."
