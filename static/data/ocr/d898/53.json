Quayle\nGeneral Consultant\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York, New York 10022\nDear Dons\nAt our February 14 meeting in Mr. Swezey’s office\nyou asked that I prepare a document citing criteria\nby which non-commercial radio stations might be more\nprecisely identified.\nThe comments are my own and do not reflect a policy\nposition of the National Association of Educational\nBroadcasters or its radio division, National Edu¬\ncational Radio.\nAs executive director for NER, X plan to bring the\nmatter of criteria for educational radio stations to\nthe attention of the NER Board as it relates to member¬\nship in National Educational Radio. Our current policy\nis to accept in membership any non-commercial licensed\nstation who applies for membership. X think this policy\nunwise and will recommend at some future time, that we\ndefine our membership requirements more precisely.\nThis is virtually mandated by the diversity of factors\nrelating to educational radio broadcasting.\nI hope that the studies done by Allen Miller for the\nRadio Committee of the Corporation for Public Broadcast¬\ning and the Samuel C. 0. Holt study of Public Radio\nexecuted for CPB and The Ford Foundation will address\nthis matter. Without attempting to pre-judge either\nstudy, I will observe that considerable sentiment can\nbe found for some method of demarcation of non-commercial\nradio stations into public and other categories.\nAs of mid-February, the FCC had authorized 25 AM stations\nand 362 FM stations and approved construction permits\nfor 32. As of this letter there are 387 educational\nradio stations on the air. To suggest that the Corp¬\noration can and should fund all on equal basis is sheer\nfolly."
