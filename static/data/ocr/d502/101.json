Bovik\nAmbassador Hotel\nLos Angeles, California\nDear Morrist\nInasmuch as you request off-the-record guidance in regard to\nhow active you should be on behalf of the H7TRC in attempting to secure\na special status with AFTRA and the other unions, offhand I would guess\nthat you should provide all advice possible to the ETRC. Anything you\noan do informally to achieve recognition of the fact that the funds\navailable to the STRC are only a drop in the bucket as compared to the\nneed, would also seem justified.\nPersonally, and subject to Graydonâ€™s feeling as well, I do\nnot think that you should represent the STRC formally or be expected to\nhave the full information on their operation that efforts to \"represent*\nthem would imply.\nAs I look back over this, I have a feeling that this is\npretty much the way you seem to see the situation. In a way STRC\nrepresents \"national\" as opposed to the NAE8 \"local* on the labor\nscene as well, however. And as such, the two are obviously not entirely\nseparable* Does this do it?\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSswo\nC c. -"
