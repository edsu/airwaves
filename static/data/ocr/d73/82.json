  "text": "The non-commercial educational stations\nare carrying their lessons and lectures into the\nhome, as well as the classroom, to a potential\nlistening audience 50 per cent larger than the\nnation’s total school enrollment.\nThe commercial stations and networks are\noffering an ever increasing fare of educational\nand cultural programs to entire regions, and,\nin the case of NBC’s Continental Classroom,\nto the whole nation. Incidentally, Continental\nClassroom’s course in Modern Chemistry\npoints up sharply the great value of color tele¬\nvision in education. Those early risers among\nyou, who have seen Dr. John Baxter’s labora¬\ntory demonstrations, can appreciate color TV’s\namazing capacity for enlivening educational\npresentations.\nI envisage the day when all the nation’s\nschools will be linked in one comprehensive\neducational television network. Such a net¬\nwork, far from imposing uniformity on local\ncurricula, could help to provide richness and\nvariety.\nAs interest in educational television grows,\nTV set manufacturers are working hard to\nimprove the style and utility of their products\nfor the classroom. For example, RCA is dis¬\nplaying here at your convention for the first\ntime, a new television receiver designed spe¬\ncifically for classroom use. This model, which\nwill be available after the first of the year,\nfeatures greater picture brightness, higher\naudio levels, precision tuning, ability to be\nlocked, greater mobility, and a special stand\nthat can raise the set to a height of six feet.\nThis new model was designed on the basis\nof suggestions offered by educators and edu¬\ncational broadcasters themselves. And I want\nto take this opportunity to thank the educa¬\ntion fraternity for their help and cooperation\nin this project.\n5"
