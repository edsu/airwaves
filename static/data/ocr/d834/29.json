However, the thing that bothers me is whether\nor not such a proposition can possibly be brought off in connection\nwith the annual meeting.\nIf it was to become the annual meeting I ©an see some possibility\nfor bringing the matter off. However, I am certain that nothing of\na \"workshop\" nature could be successfully accomplished, as an appendage\nto the annual meeting and, secondly, I m frankly beginning to doubt\nthe value of all of these exploratory workshop® which delve into the\nphilosophies or pseudo philosophies of educational television#\nWhat we need are some straight teaching and explanation of proven\nideas that have already worked. Unless we got ourselves put together\nand standardised rather soon we are going to be on pretty shaky ground.\nI think a small conference preceding a big conference where a modus\noperand! could be explained and support sought for it would bear promise.\nThis sort of thing perhaps could be done in a day.\nSincerely,\nRichard B. Hull\nRegion I? Director\nRBHtdm\ncct Officer® and Directors"
