  "text": "- 5 -\nThe compilation of the data showed a minimum need for 97 VHF and 825\nUHF channels to be added to the presently reserved 88 VHF and 187 UHF\ntelevision channels. This makes a total of 922 channels added to the\npresent 275 educational channels for a grand total of 1197 channels needed\nfor education.\nIt soon became obvious that this number of channels could not be ac¬\nquired from the present table of allocations, nor even \"dropped-in\" under\nthe present rules. A careful search of the table of allocations in\nreference to the indicated areas and scope of channel needs produced a\ntable of \"additional availability\" of 48 VHF and 608 UHF channels, or a\ntotal of 656 additional channels that would fit the pattern of need.\nTwenty-three of this number are \"dropped-in\" channels which have been\nengineered in the individual states to fit the local needs. The engineer¬\ning report does not include these 23 channels but they are included in\nthe previously mentioned statistical table.\nIn this survey the basic and minimum needs of education have been\nestablished, and a schedule of television channel assignments produced to\nprovide for approximately 75 per cent of those needs in the next 10 to\n15 years. With a proper consideration for the educational service and a\ncareful revision of rules by the Federal Communications Commission, the\nother 25 per cent of the minimum television needs might also be provided,\nand perhaps more.\nNo extended consideration was given to the present financial ability\nof the educational agencies to meet their established needs, nor to any\npresent political inhibitions. The minimally established and projected\nneeds were considered only as needs which are well within the capacity\nof the basic resources of our society to provide."
