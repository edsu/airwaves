It is my guess that the list of pending applications would be\nconsiderably reduced, by virtue of the fact that a number of\napplicants will request deferral - but it is also my guess that\nthe list of applications for consultants to review, which request\nconsideration for funding in 1969 will be at least two or three\ntimes as great as the available funds. After their recommendations,\nmore processing on individual applications may be required - but\nif those hypothetical dates were to hold up it would mean that we\ncould start to make ETV grants shortly after May 15, and probably\nobligate all the funds between May 15 and June 15th. I repeat -\nthose are guesses, not promises. But they will give you some\nidea of the time sequences which will be required to get to the\nstage of grant awards.\nLet me add just one more item. The \"cut off date\" to be announced is\na final date - not an \"initial date.\"\nIt will help us considerably if we can receive responses prior to any\ndeadline date. This will be particularly true in the case of pending\napplicants who can rather easily determine projects which will require\ndeferral.\nThe necessity to review your own pending applications under the fiscal\nlimitations - and in many cases the need to cooperate and coordinate with\nstate ETV agencies - certainly gives you something to do while waiting for\nnew Regulations and other forms to be issued. Such basic decisions which\nneed to be made as \"whether to defer your request\" or \"how it might be\namended\" require only the knowledge of a $340,000 state maximum in order"
