Sunday afternoon we can drive back to Montgomery,\nto Birmingham, or to Tuscaloosa - at whichever point you desire\nto take a plane for the return trip or the four of you may stay\nat Fart Walton longer if you wish and Ora Mae and I will drive\nback home that night*\nThere are several possibilities for activity Saturday\nand Sunday. We can drive down the Gulf to Mobile and go through\nthe Eellingrath Gardens one day and go deep-sea fishing the next\nif anybody so desires or we can loaf in the sand and eat sea food*\nThere are dances at various joints Friday and Saturday nights\nand a considerable amount of just plain scenery. The shipyards\nin Mobile are very interesting and the azalea trail in Mobile\nis an experience*\nBy way of clothes, everybody should have a swimming\nsuit in the event the sun is shining, but the ladies will not\nneed any dress up clothes at all - a street dress, a pair of\nslacks, a skirt and blouse, and walking shoes or play shoes*\nI am taking a pair of blue jeans, a pair of shorts, and sandals*\nThe cabin will probably cost us around $7*00 a couple\nper night* Deep sea fishing will be five bucks per person should\nwe desire to go out and Bellingrath Gardens will cost #1*50 per\nperson if we go there. Food is very reasonable and I hope to find\na cabin with an equipped kitchen. ("
