It's one of\nthe newest and most active of all\nthe science areas. Why, man has\nlearned more about the ocean in\nthe last twenty years than he's\never known before in all history!\nTEACHER: That's wonderful, isn't\nit?

Or maybe\na couple of problems. Why has\nman waited all these centuries to\nexplore the ocean depths? And\nwhy...now...has he so actively\nbegun? Would we like to find out?"
