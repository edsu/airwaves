I realise that BFA has sold these people a\nbill of goods and that Burt is doing his best to counteract it;\nhowever, I really believe we need to get Keith over there as soon\nas possible to set things straight with these people. Essentially,\nhis task should be to make clear our interest in noncomnercial,\neducational stations as opposed to BFA*s primary interest in\ncommercial stations. In short I think we must make ourselves over¬\nseas and not leave it to BFA*\nSince George Probst not long ago said to me — \"kfe Ignore NAEB Stations --\nyou can11 get blood out of a turnip,” I am now surprised to find them claim¬\ning to represent both the educational and commercial stations.\nI would think we must, whenever possible, negotiate separately from BFA.\nSurely if we*ve learned anything, it is that no one can be trusted to repre¬\nsent the NAEB except loyal NAEB people without other loyalities of this sort;\nI*d say we must maintain steady pressure, ceasing to press when the nerves\nin our fingers tell our sensitivities that here we shouldn*t insist. In the\nPrix Italia case, only, it seemed to me we had reached this point. You might\nverify as graciously as possible."
