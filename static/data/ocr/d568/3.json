  "text": "Situation Report\n-3\nThe Ford Foundation feels that establishing the single voice\nfor public television (which it equates with all of public\nbroadcasting) is essential to its continuing involvement.\nIt is counting on Rogers' group to secure the guaranteed\naccess to the interconnection; without such a guarantee, it\ncannot go ahead with funding any programs. If the new entity\nis established, I am assured that NAEB's activities will be\nassisted, whether we join in a formal merger or remain an\nindependent professional society. Ford is officially\ninscrutable, but my impression is that we could count on\nsuPPort for an adjustment period of as long as three years."
