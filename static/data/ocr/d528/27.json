It tends to underscore my own conclusion that de¬\nvelopment of today's producers and tomorrow's managers is an\nobjective that has to rank among the most significant for the\nCorporation.\nI want to impose on you for further assistance in connection\nwith the Seminar. I would benefit greatly from any thoughts\nyou may have about improving the design of this type of work¬\nshop, as well as on the broader subject of manpower training\nfor public broadcasting. Meanwhile, please accept my deep\nthanks for your participation this week.\nSincerely yours\nJo\nPresident\n1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019, Phone: 212-582-2020"
