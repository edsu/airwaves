  "text": "Our vision would be limited if we failed at this time to give\nspecial thought to education beyond the high school. Certain problems\nexist now in this field, and already we can foresee other needs and\nproblems shaping up in the future.\nShortages now exist in medicine, teaching, nursing, science,\nengineering and in other fields of knowledge which require education\nbeyond the level of the secondary school. Changing times and con¬\nditions create new opportunities, and challenges. There are new\npossibilities for older persons — properly trained — to lead more\nproductive and rewarding lives. The tide of increasing school enroll¬\nment will soon reach higher educational institutions. Within 10 years,\nwe may expect three students in our colleges and universities for\nevery two who are there now.\nHigher education is and must remain the responsibility of the\nStates, localities, and private groups and institutions. But to lay\nbefore us all the problems of education beyond high school, and to\nencourage active and systematic attack on them, I shall appoint a\ndistinguished group of educators and citizens to develop this year,\nthrough studies and conferences, proposals in this educational field.\nThrough the leadership and counsel of this group, beneficial results\ncan be expected to flow to education and to the Nation in the years\nahead.\n—Dwight D, Eisenhower\nExcerpt from Special Message on Education\nsubmitted to Congress on January 12, 1956."
