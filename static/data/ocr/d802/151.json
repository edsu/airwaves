This puts Wright and Westbrook\nfrom the same institution as your two sub-chairmen,\nbut that may be for the good instead of the bad. I\nhope so.\nFor your general information I am attaching\na copy of an inquiry made to Board members simply\nto indicate to you how I am trying to check before\nmaking announcements.\nI trust youâ€™re well, happy and sober. Best\nregards to Em.\nSincerely,\nFrank E. Schooley\nPresident\nFES:ftah\nEnel"
