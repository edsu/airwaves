Would sometime during the\nweek of November 26-30 be a good time for me to call on you and\nHarry? I could come anytime that week.\nIn this connection, let me raise some questions about JCET.\nDoes your present term as NAEB member on JCET end on December 31,\nor on some other date? In the event that I shall soon have to be\nconsidering the matter of an NAEB member, I'd like to attend one\nmeeting as a non-participating observer before having to take\naction on future NAEB membership. I understand the next meeting\nis December 5- If this decision must be made soon I'd like to\naccompany you to Washington at that time. I imagine JCET would\nbe willing to pick up the check for two NAEB people at one meeting\nunder such circumstances.\nI'll send this off air mail. If you can get a reply back by\nFriday, November 23, you can air mail your answer; if not, perhaps\nyou should call me on Friday (Federal 2-8158, Extension 6o45) so I\ncan make my plans one way or the other for next week.\nBest personal regards,\nYours sincerely\nBurton Paulu\nDirector of Region 4\nBP:lt\nfi"
