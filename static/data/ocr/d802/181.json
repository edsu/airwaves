Mix\n/<**<\nHELLO NEIGHBOR: This program did not sell, so far as I was concerned*\nThe acting was too amateurish, the voices too young to be convincing.\nThe production, at least in the first program, left much to be desired*\nThe background sound was entirely too loud* The voices couldn*t, or\ndidn*t, carry over it. Particularly bad was the voice of the girl nar¬\nrator in the first program. She had an authentic accent, it’s true, but\nthat*s all she had. Vote no.\nGEORGETOWN RADIO FORUM: We have long needed a replacement for the Chicago\nRoundtable. I think this is it. Vote yes.\nLIVELY ARTS: This might be a good program if I could tell what it was all\nabout. There is no introduction, no setting of the scene, we don*t even\nknow who the speaker is. With these three elements the program might make\nsense. Without them it is a meaningless jumble of phrases. Apparently\nthere is no uniformity of time from one program to the next. Vote no.\nRECEIVED\nNAEB HEADQUARTERS\nAPR 1 1956\nAM\nPR\n^|8|9|ipill|12| 1|2|B|4|5|6\ni"
