  "text": "Curiously enough, a note from Mr. Paul Hudson\nof the Radio-Television Centre in Ann Arbor informs me that\nhe has referred my inquiry about a Ford grant to you* Since\nwe spent some little time last year discussing the merits of\nmy proposed REPORT in EUROPE through your executive committee\nI suspect the answer will remain much the same. It was my\nmistaken notion that the Center in Ann Arbor was emperored to\nact directly on a project if they found it suitable*'At any\nrate, I should be glad to give you additional information\nabout my reporting project ( the format of which has been\nsimplified and streamlined considerably)*\nAnd one additional matter at hand, if you will.\nWhile in Washington last week, I chatted with the USIA people\nwho were quite interested in using me in a special project; and\nin order to hurry up the labyrinthine security process, I gave\nthem 10 names of persons now residing in the United States\nwho had known me in Europe* Now, if I recall correctly, you\ncame to Rot Weiss Rot after I had left; but William Green was\nstill there. And I unfortunately do not know his present\nwhereabouts, although I did know your address exactly. So-\nwould you be kind enough to refer the investigating party\nwho may call on you in the near future to Mr. Green, if you\ndo happen to have his present address. This is fairly\ninvolved and indirect I realize, but done in the interests of\nsome expediency ( Or what USIA believes is expediency).\nMany thanks for your kind attention, and I hope\nthings are going well at NAEB and that life in Urbana is\nstimulating. My best wishes for a pleasant holiday.\nCordially yours.\n/ /John H Lerch"
