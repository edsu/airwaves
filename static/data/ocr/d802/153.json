The gal is a little too coy at times.\nThese programs claim to deal with the human side of the UN, but it doesn’t\nseem so to me. As a matter of fact, in general I’d say that these interviews\ncover subject matter that is better covered, and in a more listenable way,\nby the programs put out by UN itself. Apparently, too, these programs are\nof varying length, though I didn’t time the two audition programs, and John\nmakes mention of this in the data sheet. The second program (that is, #10)\nis actually more on 11 the human side\" than the other program was. Of course,\nthe second guest does a much better job than the first. These two factors\ncombined make the program rather listenable. However, I’m afraid that, with\na series of this kind and a moderator like this one, there would likely be\nmore programs like the first (bad) than like the second (good). Therefore,\nbased on the two programs I heard, I’m afraid that I’ll have to vote NO.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\nHEH*jy\nCC* Radio Network Acceptance Committee"
