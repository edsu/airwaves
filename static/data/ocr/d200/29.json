Harley\nPresident\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nSorry I had to leave the meeting so soon. I must repeat\nhowever that inviting Jack as a speaker, re-opening the\nquestion of the Board*s action on Production and exhibit¬\ning a generally weak attitude toward those who (as re¬\ncently as Rome) have sworn to completely destroy the\nNAEB seems to me to be a poor, poor way to conduct the\nNAEB*s business.\nIf the results of this are what I believe they surely\nwill be, then KTCA-TV may well have to reconsider its\nwhole position vis-a-vis the NAEB, including the pro¬\nvision of memberships to its personnel, its own member¬\nship and its efforts to support the organization by work\nand occasionally by Foundation grants.\nIn short, the NAEB I want KTCA-TV to be associated with\nis the one where Hull could quote eloquently from \"Exodus\"\nand fire a roomful of the previously indifferent with\nenthusiasm - the one which (when Jim Robertson told\nSkornia the NAEB should not run the Washington Conference\nbecause \"the affiliates have a low opinion of the NAEB\")\nthbugh Skornia told Robertson to mind his own business\nand held the Conference.\nI am not much interested in belonging to anoorganization\nwhich seems determined to commit suicide and quakes because\nJohn Crabbe’s station is too broke to pay its dues. Such\nan organization would leave me too indifferent to support\neither financially or in terms of effort.\n7|8|9|ip|lX|12|^2|3|4|?|?"
