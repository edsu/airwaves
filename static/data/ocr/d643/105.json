  "text": "-3-\nthe study groups, I have been told that they were very well run.\nThe \"Conversations From Where We Sit,\" by Messrs. Hickey,\nReinert, Johnson and Gilchrist, brought forth some excellent\nideas, as did the talk by Tor Gjesdal. As a quickly toased-off\nhyperbole, your reference to the Follies as \"the major effort\nof the convention\" reads well; but as a statement of fact, it\nfalls to the ground! (Incidentally, I thought your own contribution\nto the Follies very good; next time, perhaps you and I should\ndo a bass horn-bass voice duet!)\nIt Is good, of course, to bring these matters into the\nopen. It was to consider just such basic problems that the\nBoard of Directors had scheduled its forthcoming meeting. I\nhope you will withhold judgment of the Board1s treatment of\nyour two proposals until it can meet to consider them. In\nthe meanwhile, I should be glad to receive further suggestions\nas to just what changes you think are in order. HAEB wants\nto serve all educational broadcastersâ€”radio and television,\nopen and closed circuit, in-school and out-of-school, Schwarzwalder\nand non-Schwarzwalder! With constructive suggestions from you,\nwe can do our job that much better!\nYours sincerely.\nBurton Paulu\nPresident\nBP :ds\ncc: NAEB Board of Directors\nHeadquarters staff"
