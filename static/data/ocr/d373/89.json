Religious Broadcasting Programs\nThe Councils of Churches throughout the country and the Dioceses\nhave staff members, ministers or priests who develop religious programming\nin each of the pities. Never has there been a time when we need a moral\nre-awakening, a moral re^strengthening, in America. Because of the mutual\ninterests and mutual concerns you all share, we have given these religious\nbroadcasters your names. They may have existing broadcasting in which\nyouth Opportunity messages can be included, or radio and TV spots available\nthat would be helpful. We also have their names; it makes for a lengthy\nlist, so if you wish the names of those responsible for Catholic and\nProtestant religious programming in' your city, drop a postcard to Gay\nClark, JWT-New York.\n3.
