Maclin, Jr<\n- 2 -\nOctober 1, 1956\nperiodically; services of our Placement Service, television engineer, legal\ncounsel, management consultant, etc.; plus the normal day to day services,\ninformation, and advice that any national organization gives its members.\nUnder separate cover we are sending you samples of some of the materials\nwe regularly send our members, plus other items which will give you more in¬\nformation about the Association. Of course, Associate and Affiliate members\ndo not receive as many of these materials as regularly as Active members do.\nIn addition. Active members with radio stations may use the facilities of\nthe 1 AEB Radio Network upon payment of an annual assessment fee. The Network\ndistributes approximately eight hours of programming, by tape recording,\nweekly, to members subscribing to its service. This fee is also based on\npower (with the same power classifications as membership) and a new station\ndoes not have to pay the full fee until the third year it is in the Network.\nThe fees ares\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nIsdLXstt\n$400.00\n250.00\n150.00\n2nd Year\n$600.00\n375.00\n225.00\n3rd Year\n$800.00\n500.00\n300.00\nStations must also pay postage both ways on the tapes shipped to and from Net¬\nwork Headquarters here in Urbana, Illinois. Still even a Class A station pay¬\ning its full third-year rate is paying only a little over $2.00 an hour for\nbetter than 400 hours of programming from the Network in a year. This is about\nthe most inexpensive programming a station can do.\nIf, after looking over the materials which we shall send you, you have further\nquestions, we shall be most happy to answer them.\nSincerely,\nHarold E.
