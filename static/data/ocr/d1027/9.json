  "text": "Dr. Maurice F. Seay, Pag© 2, March 31, i960\neducation in all these areas? Versus, of course, concerns about a single\nmonopoly. (Even the NEA has competition in the ACE, etc.)\nHaving been given by Ford funds with which to hire a large and go-getting\nfund-raising staff, the Center has most fund sources pretty well cornered, it\nseems. They, in turn, have engaged or retained most of the best available\nfund-raising firms.\nRoughly (here a double-edged word) I guess it all reduces itself to money.\nWhite has (as he says frequently) some eleven million, with it growing\nevery day. This is a new *'ethic* * for a chap like Skomia who had normally\nnot always evaluated progress in quite such fiscal terms.\nWe hope to have a \"proposal** from White along these lines soon, as I men¬\ntioned . This will be discussed by our Board in Columbus along with his\n\"network merger\" proposal. To attract us it must at least contain provision\nfor the NAEB*s continuance as an entity (electing its own officers and direc¬\ntors) as much as possible, and assurance of adequate fiscal support for the\nfuture. Even then, of course, I have misgivings. Perhaps we may yet\n\"strike'* funds in time to say \"no thanks** with more confidence and firmness\nthan we have recently been able to muster. It*s a little difficult to dislodge\n\"faits accomplis\" of the dimensions now confronting us. This includes the\nCenter's plans (with Ford funds and support) for Washington — which include\nnot one but several lawyers, etc.\nAs I seem to say each time, lately, we hope to know more about all this\nsoon. I wish the story were brighter right now. And thanks for your under¬\nstanding and interest.\nSincerely,\nHarry J. Skomia\nPresident\nhjssrs\nBlind CC: Mr. William G. Harley C\nMr. Richard B. Hull\nMr. Frank Schooley\nMr. James Miles"
