If you don’t need all the information\nI am supplying I will be most happy to cut it down. If you need\nadditional information I will reluctantly supply it, but in the\nmeantime push them along since I am travelling on KTCA’s funds\nand the business office is glaring down the hall suggesting I\nclear up these items•\nR.
