These will be important to the\nwriters and producers.\n1 o The kits are to be directed towards teachers or\nstudent teachers who have limited or no previous\nexperience with instructional television.\n2. The kits will be used primarily by educators who\nare teaching or directing in-service teacher edu¬\ncation classes or workshops dealing with instructional\ntelevision program utilization.\n3. The kits will have a secondary use by educators\nteaching or directing pre-service education\ncourses at colleges and universities.\n4. Throughout the kits there will be an emphasis on\nthe team teaching aspects of utilization.\n5. The content will be limited to the instructional\nuses of television.\n6o The kits will be so designed that they can be used\neither in sequence or as individual presentations.\n7. Utilization procedures will be Included that can\nbe used with ail levels of television .'support from\n\"enrichment” to \"basic teaching.\"\n8. The emphasis in ail of the kits will be to show and\nto demonstrate utilization not merely to talk about\nutilization or show examples of instructional tele¬\nvision programs without the classroom activities.\n9. Use terms \"follow-through\" not \"follow-up\" and\n\"enrichment\" and \"basic instruction\" to denote the\nlimits of a continuum."
