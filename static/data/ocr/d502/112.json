He advanced the old argument\nabout the producers and directors getting less\npay than the engineers which gave me a chance\nto remind him of the WNYC experience, etc. Of\ncourse, I can always tell him that the kid who\nhas the brains to produce good shows winds up\nlike Ted Cott, Dick Pack, etc.\nIn developing his audience they haven’t\ndone much about labor. He admits that was an\nerror. He has the labor Federation of Missouri\npresident on his board. He agreed that if he\nneeded help on local labor contacts, his public\nrelations man would contact me. He will follow\nthe thing up and will call on me if he needs\nany help.\nMSNtck"
