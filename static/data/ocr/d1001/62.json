Carl’s pious, soap-box\nmanner is a little hard to take. Despite the uneveness of\nthe two programs (fully explained by our Mir. Holt) I feel\nthat the idea is a good one. Previous presentations have\nbeen excellent and I see no reason why the current series will\nnot be equally so. I vote yes.\nProfessor Pierce’s comments about Donne and Coleridge\nare pithy and witty. The readings did not overwhelm me but\nthey were quite well done. I believe that “Hommage to Poets”\n(don’t like this title very much) will be a fine addition to the\nNetwork. Yes.\nTrust that all benefited from the recent Convention. When\nare we going to convene in a hotel that those of us operating\non skimpy budgets can afford to stay in for the entire convention.\nfinely\nJim Slack, Member\nNetwork Acceptance\nSubcommittee\nJ S/ms"
