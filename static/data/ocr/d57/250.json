C.\nWASHI]\ni\nDear Mr. Underwood,\nMr. Jack Suromerfield of WGBH-FM in Boston has\ninformed me that he has sent you the tapes of the St. Albans\nsymposium, ’’Science and Secondary Education.” If it is at\nall possible, I would appreciate knowing if, when, and where\nthese tapes will be broadcast over stations in the NAEB\nnetwork. The reason for this request is that I would like\nto send announcements of any such broadcasts to those\nconnected with St. Albans residing within the area of coverage.\nFor your information, our second symposium in this\nseries, entitled ’’Art and Secondary Education,” is tentatively\nplanned for the last week in October. This will consist of a\ntwo-week exhibition featuring the art work of past and present\nSt. Albans students as well as early and late works by well\nknown American artists. One of these days will be set aside\nfor speeches by distinguished figures in the world of art in\nthis country. I don't know whether this program will be of\ngood broadcast material or not, but if it is, I certainly will\ninform you of its content and availability.\nSincerely,\nRussell F. Carpenter\nDevelopment Director"
