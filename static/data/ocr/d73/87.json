Some of our\nindustrial corporations are spending more\nmoney on R & D all by themselves than is\nbeing spent in all branches of education com¬\nbined.\nIt is true, of course, that a few organizations\nare carrying on notable experimental work in\nthe educational field.\nThe Ford Foundation and its allied groups\nare doing a remarkable job in exploring the\nfrontiers of teaching. Typical of their imagi¬\nnative approach is the recently announced\nairborne educational television project in\nwhich programs will be relayed by plane to\na six-state area of the Midwest.\nAnother example of worthwhile educa¬\ntional experimentation is to be found in my\nown home community of Greenwich, Connec¬\nticut. Recently, Greenwich joined forces with\nthe neighboring areas of Westport, New\nCanaan and Darien to initiate a joint Research\nand Development project. The four partici¬\npants are seeking a grant from one of the\nfoundations to get the program off the ground.\nOnce it is under way, they plan to allot a\ncertain percentage of their annual budgets to\nfinance it.\nStill another example of experimentation is\nthe Center for Instructional Television which,\nI am happy to report, RCA has helped to\nestablish at New York University this fall. The\nmain purpose of this Center is to conduct re¬\nsearch and development on the most effective\nways of using TV as a teaching tool, especially\nin uniting the teaching, broadcasting, and\ngraphic arts.\n10"
