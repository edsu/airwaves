It appears unlikely that\nwe will be able to make a decision before our fall eon- „\nvention. In the meanwhile, may I suggest that you\nratify ny .action in appointing this committee and then\nyou move in to the committee as is your proper responsi¬\nbility as President. I ©till think it vary desirable\nthat m come up with a name to submit for Board approval\nprior to the November tnaoting if at all possible.\nYou will be interested in the names which we are\nstill considering* At the top of toe list are Marry\nSkomia, Earl %xm, Robert Greenlee (Dean, Sciences\nDivision, Iowa State}, -and a man named Bro at the\nUniversity of Illinois* Others are Jim Day, Irving\nMerrill, Ken Christisuson. Gale Adkins, Paul Read,\nV^ebb Neeley, Delict Morris (President, Southern\nIllinois University), Warren Bower, M Browne, Worth¬\nington Gregory, and Heenhaus (who ie now with TVA)*\nThese are the names left from about 75 originally\nconsidered* VanDiyne, Wilbur, and several others have\nurged again that I take this spot, but I still cannot\nsee giving up what I am doing where I am even for twice\nwhat I am making. If I knew that TV for Alabama were\nout of the picture, I would take toe job immediately*\nIf you have ary possible candidates for the job, toss\nthem in and let*s get to work on them immediately."
