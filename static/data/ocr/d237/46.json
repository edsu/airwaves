Since the authorized change consisted in an\nextension of time to June 30, 1956, the Fund agreed\nto make an additional grant of $1,500 to carry the\nproject through to that date.\nIn our letter of January 21 we stated that a check\nfor $1,500 would be sent you within a few days.\nOn second thought, it seems more reasonable that\nwe should make the additional payment of $1,500\nat the time payment of the second-year grant is\nmade. Consequently, a check for $1,500 will not\nbe sent HAEB, but at the time the second-year\ngrant is due. Dr. Harry J. Skoraia vill receive\na check in the amount of $8,500, which will\ncomplete payment on this grant which terminates\nat June 30, 1956.\nWith all good wishes.\npn j\n{j.p\nSincerely yours.\nMCH: jm\ncc: Dr. Harry J. Skomia\nMartha C. Howard"
