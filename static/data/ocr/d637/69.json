Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois,\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry;\nI see copy of your letter of August 10th addressed to George\nOverton re the pressings of the second series of the \"Ways\nof Mankind\".\nI am not aware of any arrangements that were made with the\nCenter for them to control the pressings of the \"Ways of Mankind\".\nHowever, since this appears to be the case because of apparent\naction by the Executive Committee, let me call your attention to\nthe fact that it will not be possible for us to change label credits\nat this time. The NAEB label is a 'cut1 and unless we are\nprepared to spend several hundred dollars re-doing what has\nalready been done your kind offer to the Center for a label credit\ncannot be met. If a reply from Overton indicates that the Center\nrequires some sort of credit, I would suggest that you go back to\nthem and offer to have a paste-on put on the album cover inside\nor outside.\nI am sorry that we have moved so fast.\nWith all best wishes,\nCordially yours.\n$\nSeymour N. Siegel\nDirector"
