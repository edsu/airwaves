  "text": "- 20 -\nMr. Klippert (ARD-SR) was particularly interested in the\ncontribution of the YLE as an example of a drama production which could\nbe used by others without the necessity of translation. He hoped that\norganizations doing such production would place them on offer through\nthe EBU in the usual way. On this same subject of international exchange,\nMr. Esslin felt that there was food for thought in borrowing from film\nand television techniques by producing the voice track of a radio drama\nquite separately so that it could be substituted from country to country\nand superimposed in his own language on the international tape by each\nuser.\n7â€¢ The Place of Drama in the Overall Programme Framework\nAll organizations represented at the meeting spoke in detail of\ntheir practice in this respect and a summary of the information contributed\n-) is now enclosed as an appendix to the present report.\nIn closing the meeting Mr. Esslin thanked the EBU for having\nmade it possible and, in particular and on behalf of all present, thanked\nthe Intendant and staff of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk for the excellent\narrangements they had made for it and for their generous hospitality.\nStrongly supported by others, he stressed his belief in the value which\nthe meeting had had for those present and for those who would read the\nreport of it and he hoped that the Radio Programme Committee of the EBU\nwould endorse this viewpoint and enable experts in radio drama to get\ntogether again on some future occasion.\nDr. Schultes spoke for all when he thanked Mr. Esslin for his\nmost able and effective conduct of the meeting.\n1 Appendix"
