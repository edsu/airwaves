A definite respons¬\nibility. ^nd since the Negro, as a person in the\nSouth, has been violated because of segregation it\nBECOMES THE DUTY IN THE NATURE OF THE CASE FOR THE\nChurch as an organization to make itself felt with\nREFERENCE TO TH..T PROBLEM. . N D SINCE THE NEGRO\nPREACHER IS THE LEADER OF THE CHURCH, IT BECOMES HIS\nDUTY, TO THE SAME EXTENT, TO LE,\\D THE PEOPLE IN THE\nSOLUTION OF THAT PROBLEM.\nA/HAT A CONTRAST THIS MAKES WITH SOME OF THE OLDER\nATTITUDES. LET ME TRY TO MAKE THE CONTRAST VIVID BY\nQUOTING A FEW LINES FROM AN EXPERIENCE THAT iVi Y R D A L\nREPOR TS. He SAYS, ’STERNER AND I ONCE ATTENDED A\nSunday evening service in a Negro Baptist church in\nONE OF THE CAPITALS OF THE UPPER SOUTH. THE PREACHEF\nDEVELOPED THE THEME THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD WAS OF\nANY GREAT IMPORTANCE: REAL ESTATE, AUTOMOBILES, FINE\nCLOTHES, LEARNED NESS, PRESTIGE, MONEY, ALL THIS IS\nnothing.

If WE DID NOT KEEP DOWN\nTHEIR AMBITIONS AND DIVERT THEM INTO RELIGION, THERE\nWOULD BE UPHEAVAL IN THE SOUTH.T THIS PREACHER IS\nNOT TYPICAL IN HIS PHILOSOPHY OF EXTREME ACCOMMODATE\nOR IN HIS INTELLECTUAL CLARITY, BUT IT IS SlGNlFlCAN*\nTHAT HE EXISTS.'1\nI THINK WE’VE PRETTY WELL MADE THE POINT OF THE\nCHANGING FUNCTION OF THE NEGRO CHURCH AND CHURCH\nLEADERSHIP.
