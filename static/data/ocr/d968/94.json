It will be necessary\nfor you to finalise the written testimony very quickly,\nsince I will have to have 50 copies of all six of HER\nwitness's comments in the hands of the Senate Subcommittee\n48 hours before their appearance. Please keep in mind\nthat the written statement is submitted for the Record,\nand cam, therefore, be any appropriate length. But\nyour oral comments should be kept to about 10 minutes\nor so, and should be much more informal and conversational\nin tone* My suggestion Is; don't worry about the oral\ntestimony until the written formal statesaenfc Is all set\nand out of our hands; then you would have two to three\ndays to actually outline your oral remarks*\nThe Status Report on Educational Radio in the United\nStates is due from the printer within the next day or\nso; we will see to it that a copy is sent to you\nimmediately*"
