The natural and dis¬\ncriminating consumer-habits of patient attention fostered by\nprint and reading, get short shrift from the electronic media\nwhich cast the \"viewer* increasingly in a do-it-yourself\" rolfe.\nexplanation\nHere, for example, is the why the new poetry, music, and\npainting are so unintelligible to those trained in the earlier\nconsumer habits. For the new arts , like the new media, expect\nthe audience to be co-author, and co-producer. And students now\nrefuse the docile consumer role in the class-room.\nUntil, therefore, the psychic geography, as it were, of the\nworld of the new media has been discerned and described, educators\nare going to be an elite corps without maps or strategy* The\nfirst step towards this goal could be a manual of grammars of\nthe media*\nj"
