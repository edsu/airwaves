You are correct\nin assuming that authors, reviewers, researchers, and so on work in conjunction\nwith each other and therefore although we have listed five men as having contributed\nto Series HI, Article I, their work was on one article and not on a series of articles.\nI am returning your check, along with a new up-to-date index. You will note that\nthere have been additions to Series I and II (and others) and that we have added an\nentirely new Series — number VII.\nFor $7.50 we will send you aU of Series I, II, HI, IV, V, VI and VII and for an\nadditional $4.00 your name will be added to our mailing list to receive all Fact Sheets\ndistributed this year and the Journal (see enclosed mimeographed letter.) If you\nstill desire only those which you listed in your letter, the price is only $5.90 — not\nthe $6.30 you anticipated. If you do. purchase other material, you could send us\nback the same check and just make up the difference with another check, saving you\nthe trouble of trying to get a refund on a money order.\nI am also sending with this letter a listing of all mateials we have available. Per¬\nhaps you might find something of interest listed in this booklet and desire to purchase\nI hope this letter has been of help to you and didn't confuse you too much.
