Skornia\nIk Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harcyi\nAs I read the May 1954 issue of the NAEB Newsletter two thoughts came\nto mind. First this is one of the best issues which I have yet had\nthe privilege of seeing and, secondly, I somewhat deplore the appearance\nof the document.\nLet me explain my criticism. It is not the fact that it is a typewritten\nnewsletter because I think the use of typed script actually has advantages\nin terms of suggesting currency and timeliness.\nHowever I do deplore two specific itemss\n1. The fact we are using for front and back covers rather roughly done\nmimeographed documents with only a portion of the first page mast¬\nhead being in type. I believe the convention followed by more and\nmore newsletters is to have the semi-permanent data, such as the\ntitle and description of the newsletter and committees and Board of\nDirectors material which appears on the back, in permanent printed\nform. This can be done at little cost and vastly enhances the\nappearance of the document if this can be set in type.\n2. The fact we are not using an electric typewriter to make an absolutely\nclean hard stencil. I do not know what investigation has been made\nof photo printing in this connection or whether the cost is excessive,\nbut I do commend to your attention the general appearance of the\nMartin Codel Newsletter and suggest we give some attention to this\ntype of format if finances permit.\nSincerely,\nRichard B« Hull\nDirector, Region 17\nRBHsdm\ncc* Graydon Ausmus\nBoard of Directors"
