His one difficulty is that he has been unable\nto obtain funds from any major foundations largely because many of them regard\nKUHT as semi-fascist. This, of course, is not so ami they are doing their\nutmost to counteract this vicious rumor.\nAs I said, I think you, Walter and I should discuss this matter further.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Morris Novik"
