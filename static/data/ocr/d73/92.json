For\nexample, the 1830’s saw the acceptance of com¬\nmunity responsibility for public education\nand the beginning of systematic teacher train¬\ning programs.\nThe 1860’s witnessed the extension of\npublic responsibility to the high schools and\nthe development of land-grant colleges.\nIn the 1890’s there came the great widening\nof the college curricula and the establishment\nof the kindergarten.\nThe 1920’s and 1930’s saw broad acceptance\nof John Dewey’s philosophy of learning\nthrough experimentation and practice.\nToday, the astonishing advances of tech¬\nnology give promise of effecting reforms fully\nas significant and far-reaching as any of these,\nand of raising the quality of education to new\nheights. An advance of the magnitude of the\nprinting press and educational television\ncomes only once in several centuries.\nYou, in educational broadcasting, have a\npriceless new medium for the communication\nof knowledge and for upgrading educational\n15"
