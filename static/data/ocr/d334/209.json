It is equally important that the results of these\nresearch efforts be made readily available to others engaged\nin research and those responsible for the introduction and\nutilization of the media in education. It would be highly\nbeneficial to both to have knowledge of research in progress.\nIt is presumptuous to suggest that one survey of researchÂ¬\ners will result in the development of satisfactory channels of\ncommunication and a great improvement in making information\nabout current and unpublished research activities readily\navailable. But there is reason to hope that the general\napproach which was established for this study, and the\nresults which were obtained, will be an important and useful\nfirst step in achieving these goals."
