  "text": "REPORT OF THE NAEB ACCEPTANCE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE RADIO NETWORK COMMITTEE\nOctober 1, 1956\nSince last year's convention, 92 series and single-shot programs have been\nreferred to the Acceptance Sub-committee for approval. Of these, 62 have been\napproved for distribution, 18 have not received approval, and as of September 28,\n1956, there are 12 which have not been voted upon. The network is currently\noffering &J- hours of programming a week in its basic offering.\nThe basic and bonus system which had been approved for this year was not as\neffective as it might have been for two reasons: 1.) because of the high number\nof the submissions which were accepted and 2.) because the network manager reported\nthat he does not have tape reels available to make much more than Sg- hours availa¬\nble per wook.\nThe network currently has a back-log of grant-in-aid programs which have not\nbeen offered and has enough other program material to cover offerings through\nApril of next year.\nAuditing all submitted programs and determining their acceptability has\nprogressed satisfactorily, and the committee notes here with satisfaction that this\npast year there were about 30 more submissions than over the same period the year\nbefore•\nLet's all try for even more submissions during the coming year.\nRespectfully submitted by:\nRADIO NETWORK ACCEPTANCE SUBCOMMITTEE\nHugh Mix\nEdward J. Slack\nJohn Regnell, Chairman\nCopied at NAEB HQ, 10/3/56dc"
