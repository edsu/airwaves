The result\nof this study was An Inventory of Instructional Television Research, £his was a\nproject of the Institute, in Which the NAEB President and Executive Director co^\noperated closely. They were able to provide many of the raw materials and con¬\ntacts necessary in the initial stages of this study. When the study was completed,\nthe finished manuscript was forwarded immediately to the Educational Television\nand Radio Coi ter, which subsequently published and distributed it with funds\navailable from a grant made for the distribution of euch materials and for promotion\nof Educational Television material. Since this project was conceived and\ncarried out with the collaboration and assistance of the NAEB, a copy of this\nInventory of Instructional Television Research is also forwarded under separate\ncover.\nFollowing publication of this Television Inventory, it became obvious that\na similar study in the field of radio would be equally useful. In cooperation with\nthe National Project in Agricultural Communications, which is also interested in\nthe educational effectiveness of radio, the NAEB last year contracted, jointly\nwith the NPAC, for the preparation and publication of such a study. It is now\nnearing completion, and was reported on by Dr. Kenneth Harwood, a member of the\nNAEB Research Committee and the r esearch scholar responsible for its completion,\nat the recent Washington meeting of the U.S. Office of Education, October 2 0 & 21"
