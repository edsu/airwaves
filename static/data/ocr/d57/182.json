In the be¬\nginning he makes the point that many well-mean¬\ning citizens feel that “the American Way of Life”\nis an abstract term, that it cannot be specifically\ndefined. He then builds, stone by stone, a definitive\nstructure specific enough to include the basic po¬\nlitical and economic tenets of the American system.\nEach granite block fitted into the structure is ex¬\nplained. Government’s place in the economic sys¬\ntem is defined as that of referee. When the structure\nhas been completed it is offered to all Americans\nas “something they can stand for and support—a\ngood definition of the American way of life.”"
