Ulin is there as a result of his request to me* By\nthe way, why is Ho R. Gross on the list?\nI hope Mr* Griffiths will check this whole list carefully,\nespecially the subscriber list. Are all subscribers paid up,\nMr* Griffiths? (I have yet to see any subscriber’s list—and I\nspeak with the practical background of having been a newspaper\ncarrier boy some years ago--which didn’t include a lot of folks\nwhose subscriptions had expired!) I would suggest Mr* Griffiths\nwrite to those subscribers who are not paid up to suggest they\npay; if they do not, he can then let me know and I’ll cut them off0\nThe Exchange list is short, and I think well under control.\nYou might all look over the Press list though. Do you think\nthe folks at Harpers, etc* use or look at our stuff? What about\nBoth at th© DesMoTnes Register and Tribune? And Childs, Pearson,\nFleeson, Lawrence Brecher, Sfcorck, and Boutwell? Miss Gordon is\nthere by her (recent) request."
