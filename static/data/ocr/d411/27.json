Please call Monday with ary sugges¬\ntions you have. 1*11 make all changes possible. The next version\nwill be briefer.\nI*m asking our secretary, Judith Gans, to engage in a search of our\nfiles to see if any other research grants-in-aid report copies are\navailable. I agree that you should have.\nRegarding funds for travel, these are all committed except for possi¬\nble balances from the Research Seminar and/or Grants-in-Aid.
