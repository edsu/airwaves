An in^ortant recommendation\nto come out of this Seminar vdll probably be one suggesting that an advisory\ngroup be added to the Research Committee* It was felt that the Com ittee\nwould profit considerably by having the continuing advice from recognised\nauthorities in psychology, sociology, and the other disciplines, in helping\nthem shape a master plan*\nSince the Seminar study itself will not be conflated for several months,\nthe Research Committee, nevertheless, did want to call this request to the\nimmediate attention of the Board*\nConsiderable discussion was devoted in the final Research Committee meeting\nas to the qualifications and duties of this appointment* It was agreed\nthat since not only the man would have to be well qualified in broadcasting\nresearch as well as possessing ^i^e desirable characteristics found in the\ntype of person who must appear before individuals handling important fund-\nsotnrces, his minimum salary then should be set at |12,000*CX) per year.\nDetails obviously need to be worked out, however, once again we wish to let\nthe Board know at this early date the general thinking of the Research\nConriittee*\nRespectfully,\nRaymond D.
