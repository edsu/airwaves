It didn*t\nget typed until after we left Columbus. 1 am not sitting on it, and\nI think it is substantially what we agreed to do.\nIn regard to the Bog; s-Magnuson hearings: regardless of what the re¬\nports agree on, I? askew did not \"blow it badly\". The point on which he\nwas attacked was the legislative attitude in Texas, We had this situa¬\ntion adequately covered by the next day with a report from Senator Yar¬\nborough to the Committee (special cony to Representative Bennett who\nraised the question!. We think we made a good record for the Committee,\ndespite the obvious party-policy decision by the Republicans to oppose\nthe Bill, no matter what. I am happy to know that you stand ready as\nbefore to help, and 1 would be very happy to have any suggestions you\nwould like to make regarding what ought to bt done. We do not know\nwhether the Bill will pass or not. It is probable that the most cri¬\ntical factor, by all odds, is that it is very hard to pass progressive\nlegislation when the country is prosperous.\nIn another vein altogether, I would very much appreciate having a copy\nof your network plan for Region IV. At our forthcoming Regional meet¬\ning we expect to be discussing networking among other things, and I\nthink it would be helpful if we knew what you were planning to do up\nnorth.\nBest personal regards.\nSincerely,\nR. F. Schenkkan\nRFSj eb:ar Director\ncc: Mr. William Harley17\nDr. Harry Skornia"
