No successful commercial\nstation known to have operated very long, has done so with\npoorly paid personnel. In many instances, because of its\nvery nature, educational programming is even more difficult\nto handle, and to allow students who have neither the educa¬\ntional background nor the technical experience, to make up the\nbulk of any staff is, in many cases, a blow to educational\nradio standards.\nCommercial broadcasters have long delighted in pointing\nout the low quality of production and writing of many edu¬\ncational prograns. Unfortunately their barbs are all too\naccurate. The truth hurts but the shoe fits, and we can't\ndeny their accusations.\nAs directors, we often must take a negative stand,\nagree with these people or feebly make some excuse. Few\neducational radio systems can look these people in the eye\nand say \"We know you are wrongJ\" The Abbots, Ewbanks,\nMcCartys# Paulus, Schooleys, and Siegels are indeed rare\nin this new area of education.\nUntil deans, college presidents, comptrollers, and\nboards of education, can give Directors workable budgets\nand fair share of the educational-pie, these same Directors\nwill be forced to compromise on staff positions, programming\npolicies, and educational standards."
