The programs were directed by\nKarl Schmidt.\nMay 4, 5\nWilliam Pitt, Earl of Chatham (1708-1778)—The\nAttempt to Subjugate America. Chatham’s speeches\non America concern liberty, government by con¬\nstitution, and the misery of war.

A master of metaphor, of coherent de¬\nsign, and of political philosophy, Burke was at his\nbest in the Conciliation speech. The theme of the\nspeech is that \"taxation and representation are in¬\nseparably conjoined,” and that magnanimity in\npolitics is needful in holding a great empire\ntogether.\nMay 18, 1S>\nDaniel O’Connell (1775-1847)—Irish Independ¬\nence. Over a million people were said to have\ngathered at Tara in Ireland on August 15, 1843\nto hear Daniel O’Connell speak for Irish Inde¬\npendence.

Not\nso well known is the fact that it goes beyond the\nevidence in obtaining the conviction.\nJune 1, 2\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)—Lincoln-Douglas\nDebates. These debates have drama because of the\nprotagonists themselves, as well as because of the\nhistoric importance of the subject which was, ulti¬\nmately, the survival of slavery in the United States.\nJune 8, 9\nBooker T. Washington (1858-1915)—Atlanta In¬\nternational Exposition. Booker T. Washington was a\npowerful speaker, one of the most accomplished of\nhis day.

Replete with celebrated passages, this\nspeech has as its general theme the protection of\nthe home land and the survival of freedom. The\nstirring words reveal much about the orator, his\nsense of history, his imaginative grasp of the fearful\nstruggle, and his awe-inspiring courage.\nJune 29, 30\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945)—The\nFour Freedoms. The message to Congress contain¬\ning the philosophy and the description of the four\nfreedoms is one of Roosevelt’s most eloquent and\nmost influential speeches.
