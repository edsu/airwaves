The NAEB Consti¬\ntution defines an Industrial Associate as: “Any manufacturing firm engaged\nin the manufacture and/or sale of broadcast and auxiliary equipment/ wish¬\ning to further their cooperation with the NAEB and wishing to foster educa¬\ntional broadcasting through the NAEB.” This membership category is de¬\nsigned to bring about better understanding and closer relations between the\neducational broadcaster and the electronics manufacturing industry, and,\nat the same time, give such companies an opportunity to contribute, through\nmodest annual dues, to the furthering and bettering of educational broad¬\ncasting. Many such firms have for years been helpful, in monetary as well\nas other ways, to educational stations, and this membership category makes\nit possible for them to continue this on a more professional and business¬\nlike basis.\nThe Sustaining membership category was established to provide the\nsane opportunities for other, non-electronlc companies interested in fos¬\ntering educational broadcasting. This category is also designed to include\nany individual organization or group, wishing to contribute to the work of\nthe Association.\nAt the present time we have only three Industrial Associates {Motorola,"
