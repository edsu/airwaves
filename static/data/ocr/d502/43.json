When he met last week with Dr. Compton of Washington\nUniversity, Father Reinert of St. Louis University, and myself, ho wanted all\nour electronic technicians covered, those we now had on staff and those we might\nadd in the future.\nYou can see how this thing has pyramided just in informal talks.\nWhere would it go from here, either in negotiation now or in the future?\nLet me elaborate more on this overall agreement IBEW would like to\nhave. We were told last week that IBEW did not want to actually have their\npersonnel in our film department, or in our scenery construction and erection\ndepartment. We could employ anyone we wanted to there, and presumably on our\nown wage and time basis. The IBEW technicians would be allowed to and expected\nto, by the union, to help shift scenery, etc. There would be no hard and fast\njob functions to preclude something like this. Again, the question! what are\nthe probabilities of this situation pyramiding and the whole staff becoming\nunionised?\nMorrie, no educational television station can financially face a\nfuture in ijhiph everyone on staff is unionised at union commercial television\npay scales. We are now at a crucial point.\nFrom some quarters here in town I understand that the AIM has eyes\non the station, also possibly AFTRA, and even the Newspaper Guild is con*\nsidering trying to place its members as script and continuity writers.\nYesterday, the Business Manager of the IATSE Motion Picture Operators\nUnion was at the studio to see me; along with him was the Secretary of the Ninth\nDistrict of IATSE. Both wanted to place men on our staff, the first a pro¬\njectionist and the second stagehands there will be a jurisdictional dispute be¬\ntween IBEW and IATSE, and that was made dear to me yesterday when the IATSE\nrepresentatives said that they would oppose ary encroachment of IBEW into their\nfields.\nWe don’t want to get caught in any union jurisdictional disputes, we\ndon’t intend to play one union against the other, and we must be neutral and Ira-\npartial. I know local autonomy is strong in St. Louis, but it seems to me that\nthe AFL itself ought to try to reconcile its unions in terms of jurisdiction. I\nhear reports that this is being attempted in Washington, at the national head¬\nquarters, but will the locals concur?\nWith no ccascseroial income, with no profits accruing to management and\nto owners, educational stations have to predicate their operations on a level\ndistinct from commercial stations. 1 think the unions should consider pay rates\nof a different order for non-profit, educational stations. This is not a sub¬\nstandard concept for rates of pay because the standards for commercial station\noperation and for educational stations are not the same. IATSE indicated to me\nyesterday that they would agree to discussing a different pay scale than for\nconsaercial stations; IBEW was not in sympathy with this when the matter was\nbrought up last week*\nAn educational television station can be and in an area such as St.\nLouis might very well be considered by the unions as a potential training ground\nfor personnel who would be able to go from us to cocassrciaX or other forthcoming"
