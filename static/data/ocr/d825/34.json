C.\nDear Seth:\nEnclosed is a copy of a revised budget for 0. E. Contract #\nSAE-9056. We are requesting this revision in the budget to\nimplement the extension of the terminal date of the contract\nfrom February 1, 1961 to June 30, 1961,\nWe were unable to hold the Screening Committee meeting as\noriginally planned and called for in the original contract.\nE(y the time negotiations were completed and the signed contract\nwas received it was too late to obtain the material necessary\nfor this meeting. A committee meeting was held on December 10\nand 11, I960 in St. Paul, Minnesota. A small Advisory Committee\nmeeting was held on October 17, I960 to develop the criteria for\nthe evaluation of proposals and program examples being submitted.\nThis change in meeting plans has called for considerable more\ndevelopmental work carried on by mail and telephone. This not\nonly requires more time, but increases the amount of office work\nnecessary.\nBasically the budget revision calls for a re-apportioning of the\nfunds. The meeting expenses are somewhat reduced and this money\nhas been used to extend the length of the time the project staff\npersonnel are employed. This revision does not require the ex¬\npenditure of additional funds, but does call for a re-allocation\nof the funds within the approved budget.\nI am also enclosing a short summary of the project proposal you\nrequested in your February 24 letter. If you wish for any addi¬\ntional information I will be glad to supply it.\nSincerely,\nClair R. Tettemer, Sr.\nProject Director\nCRT/dw\nEnel: (2)\ndd: Mr. Harold Hill^"
