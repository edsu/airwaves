However, this\nloss does not become so evident until 1354 because a larger number\nof stations had taken programs during the first half of 1953. Then\nanother increase in July, 1954 caused another drop which reduced the\nnumber of orders during the last half of the calendar year.\n(2) For the first time in 1955 distribution of \"Special\" programs was in¬\ncluded in the statistical record of program distribution. Due to incom¬\nplete earlier records in this category the 1955 figures include \"Special5’\nprograms for all previous years as well as 1955. This, at least in large\nmeasure, accounts for the great increase over 1954 and the lower\nfigures in 1956 and 1957 which include the \"Special\" programs for\nthese years but not a previous accumulation. Taking this into account\nshows a steadily encouraging rise from 1954 to the present."
