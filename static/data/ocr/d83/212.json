His own type of films,\nof course, are mosaics painted onto film strips. He\nis increasingly being pushed in the T.V. direction.\n\\ He_now paints on every other frame in order to get further\n\\ away~from mE Wrfcaps.we cduTd induce him to do a new\nV Job called Neighbors or Brothers^JJnder the Skin, or\nsomething llkethat. A kTncT of Cain and Abel or Jacob\nand Esau, a story of fraticidal strife between film\nand television. Art Knowles is well acquainted with\nMcLaren and will be seeing him next week. Am beginning\nto get Knowles really working on media. He is beginning\nto work on the script for the videos and having made film\nhimself is very useful indeed. I hope I can arrange to\ntake him to Detroit for a few days when we are making the\nvideo.\nBlessings.\n/\"'H\nHMM/RN\nEnclosure."
