Will the NAEB consider network lines for program distribution\ninstead of tape?\n3o Will the NAEB find it possible to direct radio research funds to\nmember stations for graduate assistants, etc?\nl*o Will the NAEB develop and furnish promotion materials for programs\noffered on tape network?\n5* When will the NAEB begin distribution of tapes to individual stations\nrather than through the leg system?\n-*-*#\nKANW\nMrs. Hose Jeanne Carlisle\nOur main problems are: securing another half-time engineer (I am study¬\ning to try to obtain my first class operators license in order that we can be\non the air more) and securing more and better listening facilities« The latter\nproblem is one of money, and we hope to gradually make an improvement* Our last\nand greatest problem is how to best serve the schools with the programs available,\nand how to encourage teachers and students to take advantage of the opportunities\nwe offer.\n■iHHf\nWFPL\nHo E. Salley\n1* NAEB should actively promote the distribution of available educa¬\ntional and cultural broadcast materials from whatever sources such materials may\nhave been produced® It is our opinion that much, if not most, of the best of such\nmterials are in the hands of other than NAEB members—and this without ill feeling\ntoward any fellow NAEBers.\n2« The matter of school distribution is the other most important matter.\nNo need to examine policy or philosophy on this® The official policy is to do it*\nThe feeling here is that it just hasn*t been done.\n3o The only other important matter that has concerned us has been\ntechnical quality® I think it is a little improved, but there is room for con¬\nsiderable improvement at least in music."
