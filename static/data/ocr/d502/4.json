(I assume these comments pass between\nyou and me and, if you are going to reproduce this letter\nfor any reason, I would appreciate your deleting them.)\n!+• As to other union relations, I have established contact with\nonly one other radio or television union and that is the\nDirectors’. We have pending with them a request for a\nspecific clearance. The request has been made in terms of\na specific problem without imputation of a general policy.\n5. In the motion picture field, we have cleared with all the\nrelevant screen guilds one series of shows. However, the\nguilds involved all specifically pointed out that they\nwished to be understood as establishing no precedents by\nthis action. As you may know, in Hollywood the pay arrange¬\nments are such that a show can be cleared once and for all -\na situation which both Petrillo and Heller wish to avoid.\nThe specific unions we have talked with out on the West Coast\nare the Screen Actors Guild, the Screen Writers Guild and\nthe Screen Directors Guild. We have been advised that we\nshould some day establish contact with the IATSE but that\nthis was not necessary to obtain clearances. I suppose the\ngeneral theory that Brewer’s hostility could do us a great\ndeal of harm in the film world. If you need further data\nabout my contacts with the film guilds, please let me know.\nI feel much more secure in terms of my relationships there\nthan I do with the East Coast boys.\nSincerely yours.\nGeorge W. Overton\nGW0:ms\ncc: Dr. Harry K. Newburn\nP.S. On second thought, I would rather you did not reproduce these\nat all."
