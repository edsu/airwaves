  "text": "bably there vdll be spurts of rising prices\nfollowed by leveling-off periods. Occasionally,\nwe may experience some mild price drops in the\nfom of special sales, end of season discounts,\netc. However, large-scale price declines are\nnot very likely to develop.\nDon: You feel then that defense spending is likely\nto be the dominant influence on our economy.\nWarren: Unfortunately, yes. Marxian theory argues that\ncapitalimn cannot withstand continuing economic\nvincertainty. For this reason, the conmunists\nare likely to alternate continually between\naggressive gestures and peace feelers, hoping\nthereby to keep our economy from adjusting well\nto any particular situation.\nMr. John Schramm, Managing Director of the Calvin Kazanjian\nFoundation, has reminded me that there will be a supply of reprints\navailable to listeners requesting them. In the original series,\nmention of this offer was limited to the last five shows, but Mr.\nSchramm has suggested that the offer be made throughout the entire\nseries. If you agree with this, please feel free to have your\nannouncer (when changing the intro and close) make the offer. If\npossible, I would recommend that all requests be sent directly to\nthe Kazanjian Foundation, Box /♦31> Westport, Ccainecticut, or to the\nstation carrying the series, vrtiich in turn would forward all requests\nto the Westport address.\nWe will be especially interested to learn how many of your sta¬\ntions will be carrying the series. This will help in planning for\nthe number of requests that may come in.\nMany thanks for all your cooperation.\nSincerely yours.\nDon Nelson\nRadio-Tv Supervisor\nDN:cp\ncc: Mr. John Schramm"
