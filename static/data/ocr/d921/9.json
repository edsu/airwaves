No, this world, the world of the\nearth, Cristobal Colon, finishes at the\nPillars of Hercules. . . (with a strange\ngravity) Admiral! That map is wrong.\nSailing around the sun to look for land!\nThat map is wrong. Look at it!\nCOLUMBUS\n(after a secondâ€™s pause) I know it by\nheart.\nGARCIA\n- On that map are islands which do not exist\nand the one which exists is not marked.\nThere is no Antilia, Admiral, no San\nBrandano, but there on the Equator - over\nthere, where Behain has marked Brandano,\ndo you know what ought to be marked?\nCOLUMBUS\n(tolerantly) I am listening.\nGARCIA\n(calmly, secretly) I must tell you my\nthoughts*.\nCOLUMBUS\n- What are they?\nGARCIA\n(as if mysteriously inspired) There,\ninstead of San Brandano, a little\nfurther on, Cristobal Colon, is Purgatory."
