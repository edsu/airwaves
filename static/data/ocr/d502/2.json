Skomia, Executive Director\nNational Assn, of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\n119 Gregory Hall, Urbana, Ill.\nDear Harry?\n11, laro^je\nand I hi\n„ 'turning the letter to you. I am satisfied that Overton means well\nI have no reason to believe that he wouldn't break through the ice.\nEvidently, even in the music field the whole problem is wide open. I\nknow Clair Meader too but of course would go to Petrillo first. I guess\nhis closest contact is in the motion picture field but I cannot understand\nwhat he means by ”1 suppose the general theory that Brewer’s hostility\ncould do us a great deal of ham in the film world.” I am sure he is\nreferring to Roy Brewer who is a friend of mine ■— but if it is a personal\nopposition, he is no longer with IATSE.\nAnyhow, it is pretty obvious that very little has been done in the\nentire field, and that there is room for a general policy.\nI think I told you that I am seeing Ralph and Dick in New York for\nlunch. Ralph wants to discuss the whole problem. I will tell them\nabout our conversation and the contact with St. Louis\nIt is for you to decide whether you want to tell them about the Overton\ncorrespondences r send jthern a copy of tl|e letter. We are meeting at\nRalph Steetle’ s rooms in the Delmonico Hotel at 502 Park Avenue,°New York\nshould you want to get anything to him.\nMSNjS\nend®\n-3-"
