We run a weekly radio program on a commercial station and use\none station on FM as a relay for educational programs to hook up seven or so channels\nto rebroadcast the program in different areas.”\nLawrence Creshkoff. WGBH-TV. Channel 2. Boston: \"So fa*the reports have been\nquite different and here is yet another one. In Boston we began slowly with\nseven members in 1946 and ran about 3 or 4 programs a week on a commercial station.\nIn October, 1953, we began on FM. WGBH is the station headed by Lowell Institute\nand is the Massachusetts educational channel. On May 2, Channel 2 will be our\nassociate in TV. The most essential aspect of our organization is the number and\ndiversity of institutions in the group, and the fact that each program is thought\nof as being put on by all the members; hence, we have good cooperation and joint\nresponsibility.\"\nHartford Gunn. WGBH-TV. Boston: \"I’m director of operations at WGBH-TV and\nI think Larry has told you enough about our programming already.\"\nCharles Dudley. Emerson College. Boston.
