The utmost cooperation with all other\norganisations would be requisite to the approach to be taken in the develop¬\nment of teacher-training courses, particularly, in this field.\nSecondly, virtually all the instructors of courses which\ncurrently attempt to teach the uses of these media seem oblivious to the\nbasic differences in the effects of the media, regardless of content.\nThe j^proach visualized by the MSB is bast described in the article by Dr,\nMarshall McLuhan in the December issue of the NAEB Journal, attached herewith,\nA clear understanding of iha basic nature of the electronic media^ so different\nin their offsets and potentials from the printed media or even the film, is\nthe foundation which must precede \"techniques” instruction, if these courses\nare not to become merely orientation in the use of gadgets.\nTo presume to describe the peculiarities of the electronic media\nin depth in this document would be impractical* It is hoped that the approach\nOJ\noutlined in the article of Dr. McLuhan, who would serve as ^consultant to this\nproject, may suggest the directions in which we feel any courses in the\nuses of -the electronic media must be guided if maximum value from their use\nis to be realized<"
