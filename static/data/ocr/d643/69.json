SCHENKKAN\nDirector\nS I\nO N\nTEXAS\nMay 21, 1957\nDr. Burton Paulu\nPresident\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters\nStation KUOM\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nDear Burton:\nThank you for your kind letter and for the enclosures\nregarding your facilities and budget.\nLet me take this opportunity to advise you regarding the\nmeeting of the Associate Members Committee (in this case Gerald\nWillsea and myself), and the discussion we had regarding not associate\nbut individual members. First of all, Willses reacted very badly to\nthe presentation of the individual membership solicitation plea at the\nluncheon. I had had this same reaction, but I an so acutely sensitive\nto these things that I had put it down simply to that. This was not the\nmajor problem, however. The major problem was how Willsea, or\nanyone else, could justify to his staff the notion that members should\nbecome individual NAEB members, . He suggested that we prepare\na carefully worked out pitch showing the advantages accruing to\nindividual members; that we plan, in association with regional and\nperhaps even smaller meetings, ways in which individual members\ncould get together with officers from President down to Chairman of\nthe Individual Members Committee. We agreed that what the Profes¬\nsional Advancement Committee was currently working on would be of\nvery great interest to the individual member^, and thought that perhaps\nthere might be some special mailings to individual members regarding\nprofessional advancement problems and opportunities.\nWe realized, of course, that this was none of our Committee's\nbusiness, but we were perfectly hap; y w th the state of the associate mem¬\nbers and got on the state of individual members quite by accident. If any\nof the above seems useful to you. I'm Bure you will know what to do with\nit; and if it doesn't, it can easily be dropped into the wastebasket."
