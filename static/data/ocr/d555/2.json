However,\ni found it laudable and generally seems to hit the mark. I\nthought some of the material inane and simplified. None the\nless I vote \"yes\".\n\"British Students View U. S. Education\". Can’t tell whether\nthis is a short or an entire program series. Am frankly getting\njust a little bit weary of the views of foreigners on American\neducation etal. My fierce provincialism reveals itself under\nthe needling of foreign students who claim post-graduate\nabilities at the age of IJ4. Thinking in terms of the entire\nnetwork, I will suppress my personal feelings and vote \"yes”.\nIn other respects I think the program is quite well done."
