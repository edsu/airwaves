Therefore it would be impossible for us to\nsend you ovr various publications as they are issued without making a charge\nfor them.\nSince either Associate membership or Affiliate membership in the NAEB costs\nonly $10 a year, including a subscription to our monthly Newsletter, you\nmight find it beneficial to apply for a membership. Associate membership\nis open to educational and public service institutions regularly producing\neducational programs over commercial or educational radio and/or television\nstations. Affiliate membership is available to all institutions and indi¬\nviduals interested in the general furtherance of educational broadcasting.\nI am enclosing some brief descriptive materials which will give you an\nidea of the purposes and functions of the Association, and under separate\ncover I am sending you some otter sample materials which will give you an\nidea of the various reports, surveys, publications, etc. that we issue\nfrom time to time to our members.\nIf you have any questions after looking over this material, please let\nme know.\nSincerely,\nHarold E. Hill\nAssociate Director\n* w*\nCC: Mr. Arthur Weld, NAEB Director of Region I"
