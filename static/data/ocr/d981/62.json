Television and\nradio can increasingly be developed to serve education's best interests\nas supplements of the proper type to textbooks, syllabi, lectures,\naudio-visual aids and all the other instruments, media and procedures of\neducation.\nWe believe that one of the broad problems of education is what\nto do about TV and radio as educational tools: how to make them and\nkeep them integral and fundamental tools of education. In the present\npressures’ closed circuit too often causes educators to forget open\ncircuits television too often causes us to forget what radio can do.\nAnd all need to be kept in thoroughly educational perspectives. Until\nall are adequately tested and have found their proper role, responsible\nresearch and open-mindedness must be insisted upon.\nFor this purpose, a great deal of experimentation and research (with\nadequate distribution of results) will be necessary, as proposed, to\nhelp solve the problems raised as television and radio come more and\nmore to be used to bear that share of the educational load (and only\nthat share) which each can best and most advantageously bear,\nn. Snace Problems: The present investment in space and space concepts\nalso constitute a powerful force for the preservation of the status quo\nin much of the thinking now going into educational planning."
