I\nenjoyed it but found myself going to sleep before it\ngot to the end of the hour period. If it could be\nbroken up into two half-hour programs, it would be fine.\nIts interesting, entertaining, informative, I wish it\nhad just a little bit more of the illustration of jazz\nmusic thah it does have. But, it is too long, thats all\nthere is to it. I think the subject and material has\nplace upon an educational station, but I don’t want to\nlose the audience from the educational station, and its\ngot to be a damn good speaker that can hold his audience\nfor a full hour. This is a very quiet speaker on the\nprogram and a very good one, but not good enough for the\nlength of the program. I would like to vote \"yes\" on\nits acceptance but because of its length I’m going to\nturn in a vote of \"no\".\nCordially yours.\nm a tSjzj\nWaldo Abbot\nChairman Network Acceptance Committee\nWA: mv"
