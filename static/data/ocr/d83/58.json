  "text": "September 13, I960\nDr. Marshall MeLuhan\n29 Wells Hill Avenue\nToronto 10, Ctatario, Canada\nDear Itershall:\nWe have just received a letter from an attorney representing Ruth\nIlusbaum indicating that they intend to take legal action if we do\nnot pay at least certain ones of her claims. I have enclosed photo\ncopies of that letter and others relating to the problem.\nI intend to turn this matter over to our attorneys for their opinion\nand am sending Leonard Marks, Cohn and Marks, Cafritz Building,\nWashington, D. C., a copy of this letter plus the others mentioned\nabove.\nWill you please, at your earliest convenience, write me in some\ndetail regarding the points Miss Uusboum and her attorneys have raised,\nsetting forth your \"side of the question.” It would be helpful if you\ncould include as much detail as possible about the agreement(s) you and\nMiss Husbaum reached at the time you employed her, and if a written\nagreement was entered into, we would naturally want a copy of that. You\nshould also set forth in some detail any real arguments against paying\nany or all of the claims she makes.\nIn order that Leonard Marks may have, as quickly as possible, your side\nof this, will you please send him a copy of anything you send me?\nIn ay letter of September 1, to Miss Wusbaom, I indicated, primarily,\nthat exhaustion of funds was one of the principal reasons for not being\nable to pay her. I did this in kindness, because I didn’t feel at that\ntime it was necessary to go into detail on the points you had raised\nwith Harry and which he had passed on to me. In view of recent develop¬\nments, perhaps it would have been better had I laid it on the line a\nlittle stronger, especially since her attorney seems to take the position\nthat the lack of funds really makes no difference- At any rate, your\narguments will be necessary for further investigation of this problem."
