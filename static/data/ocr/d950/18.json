We\nhave used some of your word pairs with high loadings on dif¬\nferent factors for the stimulus words in getting continuous\naudience profiles or reactions to films. For exanple, we\nasked one group to press a switch whenever they thought a\nfilm was worthless/1 one group to press when they thought it\nwas \"weak,\" and one to press when they thought it was \"slow.\"\nWe are now analyzing the data to see if these measure different\naspects of films. We used a Latin-Square design for this, three\ngroups and three films.\nThat's about it. I don't know whether we will contribute\nanything to the knowledge of the SD technique but we're having\na good time with it. I believe a great deal could still be done\non various ways to treating data from SO tests. Is anyone at\nyour place working on this? Would be interesting to compare\nvarious tests of the same data.\nHope you have a good summer -- and that I hear from you\nsoon on this and the research committee business. You will have\nto look us up if you come to New York anytime next year. I\ncan't remember our address — we will be up by Columbia — but\nyou can always locate us through my father-in-law, Dr. Hans\nSalzmann, 514 W. 110th, New York, 25, New York.\nCordially,\nSLB:mw\nEnds.\nSam L. Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film"
