Schvarivalder\nManager, Radio Station KUHT\n3801 St. Barnard St.\nHouston 4, Texas\nDear Johns\nIn case Graydon has been too covered up to notify you (and I\nknow he has been without a secretary part of the time), this is to say\nthat he has designated you as the new Chairman of the TV Operations\nCommittee*\nVery sorry for the delay in notification. Such a fine mark\nmade by the Committee last year that I doubt if you111 need to spend\ntoo much time on it except as ideas occur to you, or requests come in*\nWould you mind sending your acceptance to Graydon, with a\ncopy to us? And is there anything we can do for yga?\nCordially,\nHJStwc\ncot Ai\nHarry J. Skoraia\nExecutive Director"
