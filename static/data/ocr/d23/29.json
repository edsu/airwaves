That provision of the proposed Section\n4.903^c) which attempts to subordinate the VHF booster opera¬\ntion to all other classes of television broadcast stations is\nobviously an attempt to minimize this potential harm. The NAEB\nis of the view, however, that such provisions as those just\nreferred to may prove ineffectual in achieving the desired\nresult. Whatever the legal status of VHF boosters might be\nunder the proposed rules, and whatever the rights thus created\nin the operators of such stations, it is clear that substantial\nsegments of the public may come to rely on the service rendered\nby VHF boosters. Those people will not be interested in the\nlegal status of the station on whose service they have come to\nrely, and there would undoubtedly be serious practical problems\nraised if a VHF booster operation were wiped out by interference\nfrom another station, particularly if the signal of the inter-\nusable one in the area receiving booster\nservice. In addition, it is probable that serious legal\nquestions would also be raised, despite the unequivocal pro¬\nvision in the proposed rules."
