First, the number of people who report listening to a station at\na given time (coincidental), and, second, the number of people who report\nhaving listened to a station (recall). In addition to this basic information,\nthe following factors seemed to have an effect on listenership: first, the\nnumber of hours listened to the station, second; listenership on AM or\nEM, third; EH set ownership, fourth; television set ownership, and fifth;\nobjections to the survey on the part of the respondents."
