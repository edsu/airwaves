The\nannouncements for the 1958-1959 program of grants should now be in the\nhands of II/VEB members and others inter©steel in research of significanc\nto educational broadcasting. A special attempt was mde to get these\nannouncements out early this year so that greater tir® and thought\ncan be given to the preparation of research proposals*\nT he Research Committee still feels that the MSB sorely needs\na full-tiiao Director of Research and adequate funds to enable him to\norganize or direct a large-scale attack on some of the many questions\nwhich need to be answered in order to better understand!; and, thereby,\nto better cany on this business of educational broadcasting* Hie"
