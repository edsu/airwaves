Exchanges of Views on :\n(a) The_Duration_of_Radio_Drama_Productions\nDiscussion here revealed a wide divergence both of practice\nand of views, best summed up by Mr. Reeves (CBC) who maintained that\na 10 minute play badly-written and produced would be too long whereas\na 2-hour well-written play could easily be too short. To lay down\nany limits in this respect would be an abdication of member organizaÂ¬\ntions' artistic judgment.\nNevertheless some interesting trends were disclosed which\nmay be summarized as follows :-\n- YLE is trying to keep its radio plays below 90 minutes.\n- ARD believes that its audience for radio drama, largely\nconservative in outlook, would be disappointed if plays\nwere to be reduced to less than 60 or TO minutes.\n- BBC finds the 90 minute play more popular than the 60-minute\none providing that there is a strong character-line and\nplenty of incident.\n- RTB feels that in view of the type of present-day listener\nand the tempo of modern radio, no play should exceed 60\nminutes and should, ideally, be between 30 and 4 5 minutes.\n- ORTF agrees in the main with the BBC but limits its more\nserious work to 60 minutes since it does not feel it can\nreally hold the interest of the listener for longer than\nthis in such cases.\n- RAI prefers a duration between 30 and 1+5 minutes.\nReminded by Mr. Esslin that the longer the play the more\nrelatively cheap it was to produce the experts concluded their discussion\non this point by generally agreeing with Dr.Hasselblatt (ARD-DF) that\nduration must depend on the development, suspense and content of each\nplay: that nothing other than aesthetic consideration could or should\ndetermine duration.\n(b) The_Size_of_Cast\nThe experts found nothing to discuss on this point and therefore\ndeleted it from their Agenda."
