However, we agree with those\nparties who urge that a general requirement that mechanically reproduced\nprograms in which time is significant be identified is sufficient, and that\nno specifics requirements should be adopted to require identification of all\nprograms falling into the categories (speeches, news events, news commentators,\nforums, panel discussions, etc*) suggested by the NART3 and other parties#\nWhile the element of time is often significant in programs of these types,\nit is not always the case, and we find no need for requiring the identifica¬\ntion of recorded or transcribed programs where the time factor is unimportant\nsimply because they are of a certain type# In our view, station licensees\nare capable of bearing the responsibility of determining whether mechanically\nreproduced material or programs falling within the suggested categories require\nidentification because of the time element and the possibility of harmful\ndeception# Therefore, the amendments we are now adopting require-that all\nmechanically reproduced programs in which time is a significant factor,\nexcept for the few exceptions noted below, must be identified, but make no\nrequirement that all -programs or material of the types enumerated therein\nmust be identified if broadcast by mechanical recordation# The categories of\n. . programs set forth in the amendment have been included solely for the purpose\nof illustrating some of the types of programs in which an identifying announce¬\nment may be required; the list is not intended to be all-inclusive, and the\n.question of the identification of programs or material falling within these\ncategories is lejPfc to the discretion of the licensee.\n15* We are also of the view that only one announcement is necessary\nto inform the listener or viewer when a mechanical reproduction is being used,\nand we believe that the question of whether the announcement should be made\nbefore or after the use of a mechanical reproduction should also be left to\nthe discretion of the licensee. The television mechanical reproduction rules\nhave permitted licensees ..to operate under similar requirements for a number of\n( years, and we believe that the NJLRTB proposal which would require an announce¬\nment, both before and after a mechanically reproduced program where the time\nelement, is significant, causes more hardship oh licensees and interruption of\n. program continuity than is warranted at the present time. We are, therefore,\n. amending the mechanical reproduction rules for all the services to require\nonly one identifying announcement for recorded programs covered by the rules\nand to make the use of such an announcement at the beginning or end of a\nmechanical reproduction or program optional With t“he licensee#\n16# Inasmuch as experience in the application of the AM and IM\nmechanical recordation rules—which for a number of years have excepted\nrecorded or transcribed programs of one minute or less from all identification\nrequirements—has demonstrated that identification of programs dr material of\nthis length is unnecessary to prevent deception, we have retained this\nexception in the new mechanical recordation requirements for AM and I’M and made\nit applicable to the TV mechanical recordation requirements as well.
