Jim Mies asked\nthat copies of it be sent to you. We hope that if you have any\nideas or thoughts on the subject you will convey them to us or to\nA1 Gaines, or another member of the school program committee.\nWe are convinced that a service to the stations doing in-school\nbroadcasting over and above the regular network offerings is a highly\ndesirable operation. The question is, how best to do it. It seems\na little more difficult to get things rolling in this area.\nIt is the firm intent of the undersigned to come back from Biloxi\nwith something definite underway on this project. If you have any\nhelpful hints, please?????\nBest regardso\nDick Rider\n' RLR/h"
