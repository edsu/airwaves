Hulsen\nDirector Radio Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York City, New York 10022\nDear All\nOne previous occasion Bill Harley and I discussed #ith\nDon Quayle and Robert Swezey the possibility of a national conference\nfor public radio* The conversation with Quayle was in Lexington in\nMay and with Sweeey in Washington sometime late that month. The\ndiscussion was fragmentary and inconclusive, but the consenses seemed\nto be that the idea had some merit and might be examined*\nOn that premise, I asked Mary Lynn Moody, the NAEB convention\ncoordinator, to develop costs for a meeting that would bring two\npeople from about 250 stations into a session.\nAs a result of the discussions in Madison, the two from a station\napproach is no longer valid nor is the 250 station figure. As I\nrecall, we discussed one person (the station management) from every\nnon-cpmmercially licensed station plus support personnel*\nI suggest we are now talking about a group of 400 station managers\nplus 25-50 support personnel (NAE8-CPB, etc.)*\nHie assumptions in developing these costs were that the meeting\nwould last two full days, transportation for all participants would\nbe funded by the host organization, individuals would pay their own\nhotel bills and incidental expenses.\nI thought you might like to review these figures. At an\nappropriate time, should a decision be made to consider such a\nconference, we would be pleased to Join you in working out more\nprecise cost figures. I think NAEB *s convention staff has the\nexpertise to handle this type activity in excellent fashion, and\nwe would be pleased to work with you on detailed planning/\nSincerely,\nRAM tkh\ncc: Estell\nMoodv\nRobert A. Mott"
