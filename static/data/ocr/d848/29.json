WHAT THEY LIKE...\nHOW THEY OPERATE...WHAT'S HARD FOR THEM\n...WHAT'S EASY...HOW EACH ONE LEARNS\nBEST.\n(This introductory segment\nwith teacher takes approx¬\nimately two minutes)\nIT MAKES SENSE, THEN, DOESN'T IT, ASKS\nTHE TEACHER, TO GIVE THE TELEVISION\nTEACHER PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nCONTENT.. .AND TO TAKEOVER MYSELF THE JOB\nNOBODY ELSE IS EQUIPPED TO HANDLE...AS\nMANAGER OF THE LEARNING SITUATION.\nIN THIS WAY, HER TELEVISION LESSON CAN\nMAKE A MUCH MORE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION.\nAND WITH HER HELP, I CAN DO MY JOB\nBETTER.
