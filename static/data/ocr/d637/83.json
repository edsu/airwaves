However,\nI wanted to get more positive data before writing you. We only\nrecently got a phonograph to play them here. For the last few\nweek© it has run many hundreds of hours. When I broke my ribs\nrecently and was laid up & couple of day®, 1 figured that this\nwas an excellent chance to hear all LP records under the HAEB\nlabel. The results of all the above, like the mail from purchasers,\nis most disheartening. Xesterday a member of the Finnish Parlia-\na«»t vaster* and w were plying hits .inflate MSS SiSMmlM- &»\nrecord stuck three times. Others stuck once each.\nI m attaching check sheets in chart for® showing Static,\ndistortion, \"needle sticks\", \"skips\" and echo, respectively, cm\nspot checks of hitherto unplaced records, on the hose type, non-\nprofessional recorders we assume to be the type which LPs will most\noften encounter, is a record with ©oho wears It is likely to break\nthru* thin walls and become a \"skip\" or \"stick\" ease, of ©curse.\n®“ reason I'a writing nov is that WftTf trf Hmittafl IT *»«\nto be tne worst of all, if that is possible, in \\<het I’d call\nproduction aspects (ddstortlon, echo, static)\nLa numerous cases in this album also, tape was apparently\nbroken. Some of the\"breaks\" are not due to skipping, for the record\nis frequently O.K. in such cases. But tapemist have been broken\nand respliced with some loss of words or syllables, before it got\non records.\nThe gain is very has, generally, also. Sine© Columbia no¬\nwhere has its mm on the albums it would seem that they didn’t\nput a good (or any) producer or supervisor on the job. I imagine\nthey don’t feel that the job is big enough to be too concerned about."
