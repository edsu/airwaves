Hull\nExecutive Director\nThe Ohio State University\nTelecommunications Center\n2470 North Star Road\nColumbus 21, Ohio\nI>ear Dick:\nThe other day when gou were in the office I meant to mention\nto you the letter regarding the International Conference on\nScientific Problems on Visual Information which you had for¬\nwarded to Bill on March 23rd. However, we had too many other\nthings to talk about at the time.\nI have checked with what sources I could find fcs you know\nLeonard is out of the country and I couldn't check with him),\nand can seem to dig up very little Information. I am sure that\nthis is not the international conference for which we are seek¬\ning RCA financial support. Neither is it the conference in\nMontreux which we hope that Bill will attend.\nI will continue to try and find out more about it, and if I do,\nyou can be sure I will let you know all the details.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nAdministrative Vice President"
