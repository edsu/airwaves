It\ncertainly sums up the problem*\nTo answer your questions specifically*\nOne, I, of course, am in favor of the top level man although I\nam not necessarily in favor of paying him substantially more than\nthe present budget stands for.\nTwo, 1 have gone over thoroughly the minutes of the Gotham meet¬\ning. I think this should bei redrawn* I have no real quarrel\nwith what is said here but 1 believe it was drawn almost in the\nheat of battle and tends to be punitive. It certainly could be\nmuch more constructive. If it could be rewritten with the per¬\nsonalities involved forgotten, 1 believe it would be a much more\nworkable document.\n/Vo T\nThree, I have^further suggestions to offer. 1 would like to see\nRishworth and ‘Russ Porter more thoroughly investigated and would\nlike to know too of the possible availability of Harry Skornia.\nSorry this reply is late. Rest assured 1*11 do anything I can\nto help.\nSincerely,\nJxmmiles\nExecutive director\nJSMsrtb"
