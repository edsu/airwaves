It!s amazing how large a gap\nthere is between the private citizen and the man\nwho commands a staff. Are we developing a class\nsociety after all? It looks as though I may be\nreduced to hand scribbling before long. The Walsh\n& Ross typewriter company, from whom I had rented\nthe machine on the project, has recently changed\nhands. Their books are in an incredibly dishev¬\nelled state. They have only scattered instances\nof NAEB payments (of $15 a month) for the rental\nof the machine. Would it be a complicated task\nto check the receipts of payments made to them?\n(Sept *59 - June i960) It might be hopelessly\ndifficult to do this, but again it might happen\nto prove quite simple.\n/\nWe had a dandy visit at our communications seminar\nfrom senior statesman Dallas Srqythe. He gave of\nhis best, and we were properly impressed. Is the\nmove to Washington going to involve you, Harold?"
