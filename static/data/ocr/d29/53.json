That\nis, when man attends to one-thing-at-a-time,\nmost of the situation he sees or hears or\nexperiences is thrust under the level of\nattention.\nLiterate man developes a very large subliminal\nlife, while primitive man, paradoxically, is\nmuch more aware of over-all situations.\nElectronic man finds he has to develop this\nkind of awareness, again, since the instant\ncharacter of information movement, to-day,\nmakes it necessary to understand the total\nfield of Impact and effect. Our field, in fact,\nis the globe which, as it were, is reduced to\nvillage size by electronics."
