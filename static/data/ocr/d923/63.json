V. in Venezuela. The Creole Foundation, it is expected, will be asked\nto provide financial aid for such a study.\nWe believe that perhaps our most effective assistance would be to\nmake it possible for a competent U.S. organization to make available some\nU. S. technical personnel, with the necessary experience in the educational\nT. V. field there, to work with the local Committee in planning and organizing\nthe study.\nThe purpose of this letter is to enquire whether or not your organizaÂ¬\ntion would be in position to provide this service on the basis of a grant\nfrom this Foundation. It goes without saying that before any final decision\non the project is made, you would be thoroughly briefed on what the job\nwould entail, so that a detailed project proposal could be prepared by you.\nThis, in accordance with usual foundation practice, would then be the basis\nof our submission to our Board for final action.\nIf you are interested in such a possibility, I would appreciate\nhearing as soon as possible so that we will have it in mind when we discuss\nthe project with the local Committee.\nYours very truly,\n/s/ E.
