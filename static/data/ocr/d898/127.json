The programming\ninitiated in earlier phases would be continued. Additional\nprograms would include consumer services, criticism, talk,\ndiscussion, and other accepted program formats. The network\nwould continue essentially as an informational service.\nTwo innovations are suggested for Phase IV.\n1. Live International Originations\n2. A limited number of domestic ’specials'.\nBy early 1970, the network staff should have the capacity to\ndevelop program fare from international sources. A variety\nof potential originations can be developed. (Again, concepts\nand formats discussed at the Ford-CPB meeting at Suffern, N.Y.\nshould be brought into play.)\nThe proposal for the broadcasting of a limited number of domestic\n’specials' takes the following form.\nDuring the 90 day period the network should program a few\n(three to six) events that occupy the major portion of one pro¬\ngram day. The four hour limitation would be broken and the\nformat revised."
