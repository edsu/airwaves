I»d suggest programs in 15- or\n30-minute units* this means technically that including\nMAEB introductions and. closing announcement, we ought\nto aim for 14:30, nd 29:30.\nIf and when you have any programs to submit, may I sug-\nfast you correspond directly4 with Mr. Robert Bnderwood,\nr. , Manager of the MAEB Radio Network.\nfhahk you so much for your suggestion and offer of pos¬\nsible program service.
