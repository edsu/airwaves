Kucera, assistant professor, radio-television-film,\nUniversity of Denver, writes that his department is consider¬\ning establishment of an International Mass Media Information\nCenter. He would like comments on facilities and services\nwhich such a center might offer—and opinions of NAEBers\nas to whether it would be useful to them and to others in\nthe mass media area.\nThe basic function of the proposed center would be to\ncollect and disseminate information concerning film, press,\nradio, and TV in every part of the world. As proposed, the\ncenter would provide, without charge, the following services:\n• Monthly bulletins in the areas of film, press, and radio-\nTV, containing up-to-date information on important develop¬\nments in these media.\n• International directories in various areas of the media (key\nbroadcasting personnel, press training facilities, educational\nfilm producers).\n• Occasional papers.\n• An international yearbook and atlas—a compendium of the\nmost significant and useful information with regard to the\nmass media in every country of the world.\nAlso, the center would answer specific inquiries and con¬\nvene conferences of American media personnel and students\ninterested in the international aspects of the media. It would\noffer its services to scholars in various parts of the world\ninterested in research into the mass media, providing guid¬\nance and acting as intermediary between such scholars and\nfoundations which might underwrite the research.\nMore Summer Workshops\nUniversity of Missouri, Kansas City.

A sub-committee has been appointed to\nmake recommendations on implementing a state-operated ETV\nsystem. One consideration to be dealt with by the subcommit¬\ntee is whether a state ETV system for higher education\nshould be operated as a state-wide network or whether col¬\nleges in such areas as far west Texas and the Panhandle\nshould be served by taped rather than live television.\n1"
