C.\nDear Bill:\nI have studied the two drafts of Jim Robertson's of\nJanuary 21, and they seem to be so much better thqn\nthe previous draft, I can see nothing wrong there now*\nI am quite delighted with the apparent willingness to\nwork together, rather than \"divide\" up the areas of\nresponsibility and \"grab\" what needs to be held for\npurposed of establishing \"prestige\" or \"security\".\nI had a very nice letter from Jim, telling me of the\nprogress that is being made. He was most conplimentary\nabout the way you were working on this, and pleased that\nhe and you were in such general agreement. He said that\nJack was coming along fine •— he says \"Jack's attitude\nis improving daily\".\nIt is a real satisfaction to see things developing in\nthis way. Bill and I hope the February 2 meeting goes\nalong in the same vein*\nI'm enclosing a copy of my reply to Aim's recent\nletter.\nLoren B.
