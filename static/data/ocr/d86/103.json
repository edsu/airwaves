May I suggest that the most rapid\naction will be achieved by contacting persons in the capital of Michigan\nrather than in Detroit, which is 85 miles away.\nThe State of Michigan has had a \"Working Committee on Educational\nTelevision\" for three years. Dr. Armand L. Hunter is a member of that\ncommittee and Mr. Larry Frymire is often called to work with this group.\nI understand that both of these men are representatives of the NAEB and\nboth are located in the capital city of Michigan. The advantages of\ncontacting nearby people or interested persons in the vicinity will\nguarantee more rapid action that persons in the Detroit area.\nYou may count on my cooperation in any future needs you may have. For\nyour information, the chairman of the working committee and myself were\nin the Governor's office drafting the enclosed reply when a telephone call\nfrom Detroit interrupted.\nBest of luck in future developments with Federal aid to ETV.\nSincerely,\nAssociate Professor\nJBT:slh\nEnel."
