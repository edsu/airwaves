The station that\ncarries such programming is a\nboon to a community.\nAs for itself, “The Ways of Man¬\nkind” is a 13-week, half-hour se¬\nries, exploring the origin and de¬\nvelopment of customs and folk¬\nways in various parts of the world,\nwith the idea of helping people to\nget along with each other by bet¬\nter understanding each other. It’s\nan intriguing, adult series, judged\nby Sunday’s (14) opener.\nThis program, titled “A Word\nIn Your Ear,” was a study of lan¬\nguages and words as they affect\npeoples, cultures, intercourse, be¬\nhavior, etc. Language reflects cul¬\nture, was the theme. The program\nwent on to expound this by in¬\nstances of differences in speech; by\ndifferences in application of words\nin various tongues and lands. Ex¬\namples of meanings of words to\nthe Eskimo, the Arab, the Indian,\nthe Chaucerian Englishman, were\ngiven. There were oddities listed\nin usage of words by various peo¬\nples.\nInstead of this being boring or\npedantic, the half-hour was fasci¬\nnating, a serious subject being han¬\ndled lightly, imaginatively and wit¬\ntily. Prof. Walter Goldschmidt, of\nthe U. of California, who super¬\nvised the series, closed the airer\nwith a discussion of language’s\n“subtle but pervasive instinct in\nculture,” showing how we can\nshare the experience of other peo¬\nples, other times, other places,\nthrough a study of words.\nStudies in education, ethics, re¬\nligion, authority, technology, art.\nthe family, are to follow in this\nseries. Their genesis, preparation\nand production, if Sunday’s show\nis a guide, was an inspiration.\nBron.\nV\nth\nIn a striking switch in mood\nfrom last week’s initial program on\nWNYC’s “People Under Commu¬\nnism,” which dealt with the grue¬\nsome activities and repressions of\nthe secret Soviet police, Sunday’s\n(14) second full-hour segment,\n“Music to Order,” discussed the\nartistic degradation of first-rank\nSoviet composers writing music o\na party line.\nThe program was lighter, gayer\nand in many ways more appealing\n—but in no way less impressive or\nimportant—than the first one. It\nwas another illuminating chapter\nin this vital, adult series, prepared\nby the Ford Foundation’s Fund for\nAdult Education, to show the power\nand intentions of the Soviet Union\nso that we may be on the alert\nagainst them.\nFormat was panel-like, with Dr.\nErnest J. Simmons of Columbia,\nwho prepared the program, acting\nas moderator, and composers\nDeems Taylor and Henry Cowell,\nand musicologist Nicolos Slonim-\nsky, as his guests. Subject-matter\nmainly concerned itself with the\nfamed 1948 decree of the Soviet\nCentral Committee denouncing\n“formalism” and western bourgeois\ntendencies in Soviet music, and\nthe effect of this resolution on the\nBig Four in Soviet music—Shos¬\ntakovich, Prokofieff, Khachaturian\nand Miaskovsky.\nPanel discussed variations in\nSoviet policy, changes in music,\neffect of party interference, etc.\nSlonimsky was the most-informed\nand most voluble, even playing dif¬\nferent music snatches at times to\nbuttress his remarks. Prof. Sim¬\nmons played from various com¬\nposers’ works and read official So¬\nviet proclamations, to give point to\nthe discussion. It was pointed out\nthat though Shosty and Khacha\nmiserably recanted against the\ntendency of “formalism” (having\nform only, and lacking in content)\nin their music, Pi'okofieff didn’t\nrecant completely.\nProf. Simmons showed how de¬\nstructive Soviet controls had be¬\ncome, and how musical composition\nhad deteriorated. He played bits\nfrom Shosty’s oratorio, “Song of\nthe Forest,” written after 1948.\nSlonimsky thought it did violence\nto Shosty’s musical integrity; Cow¬\nell thought “wicked western influ¬\nences” were still present; Taylor\nsaid that Shosty’s musical future\nwas now in his past.\nProf. Simmons offered bits from\nShosty’s Seventh (“Leningrad”)\nSymphony, hailed at first as great\nmusic, denounced later as devia¬\ntionary. Panel discussed its merits.\nAnd so the give-and-take went, for\nan hour of fascinating, revealing\ntalk.

Y.\nBecause it feels that Russia has\nbecome an international menace,\nand that a correct estimate of its\npower and intentions is vital to\nour well-being, the National Assn,\nof Educational Broadcasters has\nprepared this impressive series,\nwith aid of a grant from the Ford\nFoundation’s Fund for Adult Edu¬\ncation. Prepared with great care,\nunder supervision of authorities,\nand presented with imagination\nand skill, this series assumes im¬\nportance as top radio programming\nas well as first-rate pubservice.\nCertainly the opening program\nSunday (7), “Terror as a System of\nPower,” was that important.\nThis is an adult, serious series,\nwith little or no concession to the\nfrivolous or superficial hearer.\nThis doesn’t mean that it’s not fast-\nmoving, dramatic or exciting; it’s\nall of these. In addition, it is in¬\nformative, filling a sharp need.\nBased on documented evidence\nabout the power and purposes of\nthe USSR, the series’ first program\nwas a discourse on Russian revo¬\nlutionary history with accent on\nthe NKVD, or secret Soviet police.\nThe material wasn’t new. But it\nwas sorted and rearranged for ef¬\nfect. “Terror has become com¬\nmonplace,” said Harvard Prof.\nMerle Fainsod, who helped pre¬\npare this segment and spoke on it.\nBut we need to know how it de¬\nveloped and operates, he added, in\norder to prevent the further spread\nof fear and terror. In alternate\nnarration, quotation and dramati¬\nzation, the program discussed\nforced labor, concentration camps,\nthe several “show” trials, the vari¬\nous purges, etc. Final 10 minutes,\nwith a Warsaw Jewish lawyer tell¬\ning of his mysterious arrest, im¬\nprisonment, experiences in a work\ncamp, and his final escape, was\nperhaps the most moving and\ndramatic.\nBut the whole program was an\nintelligent discusion of the use of\nterror, the system of tight political\ncontrol, in a dictatorship, that was\nterrifying and impressive.\nBron.\nDAY\nWith\nWrit.\nProd\n55 IV\nSust;\nWNE\nIn\non J\nWNi\nhisto\npiect\ntrack\nBoos\nsevei\nfield,\ntern,\nwith\nNatio\nTh<\nwere\ntary,\nthem\nceren\nfor p<\nhowe\nlack <\nwar e\nshow\ntraste\nfor t)\nthe v;\nwhich\nSund.\nNoi\ntion\ndignil\nPARI\nWith\n30 Mi\nPartit\nWXK\nWo:\nBetty\nappro\nand t\nin a ^\nmusic\nParry\nmany\nstudic\ncraft\nsmall\nprem\nto w\nmach\ner tl\ncomn\nA r<\ntady,\nver \\\ntact.\nMl"
