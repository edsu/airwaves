I\nam attaching several copies of this report so that they may be distributed\namong those departments in your organisation likely to be interested in\nthe report. In this regard, I would like to mention that your engineering\nstaff would no doubt be interested in the section of the report which is\nheaded \"Measurement of Signals from Distant Medium Frequency TransÂ¬\nmitter\", while other sections will be of interest to your programme\nofficers or to those concerned with staff training.\nAs mentioned in the Council's report, the Chairman of the ABU Study\nGroup on Space Communication prepared for the Council's meeting a\nreport on the latest developments in this field. The Council considered\nthat this report should be made available to all ABU members and copies\nof it are therefore attached. I would like to draw attention to the fact\nthat this report is mainly concerned with non-engineering aspects of the\nuse of space communication for broadcasting and will therefore be of\ninterest to the senior administrative and programme officers of your\norganisation.\nAs a result of the report from the Study Group on Space Communication\nand other information made available during its meeting, the Council\nadopted a number of resolutions requesting action by ABU members.\nDetails about this matter will be sent to members in the near future."
