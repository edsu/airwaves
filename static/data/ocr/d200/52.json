If you didn’t keep carbons\nof same, it’s just your tough luck.\n1. Precisely.\n2. Yes, I think we should get the Executive Committee together fairly soon.\nWe need to discuss this whole fund raising project and also the ramifications of\nthe ETV production controversy. It's not any too early to begin making preparations\nfor the agenda in Philadelphia.\n3. I would be glad to have the benefit of Alan Miller’s thinking. How do you\nsuggest we involve him? I don’t suppose he will be attending the Philadelphia\nmeeting.\n4. Yes, I know about the telecommunications network plan for Turkey, Iran,\nand Pakistan. At the moment, this is purely a technical development with RCA\nhaving the general contract. Our participation would have to be in connection with\nsome sort of training program in these countries and we are already in contact with\nTurkey and Pakistan on these lines. However, this particular hookup, as I understand\nit, is not related to education or general broadcast service so much as it is to\nnational defense and common carrier transmission.\n5. So when do you suggest the Executive Committee meet—and where ? Because\nof Ken’s distance, Chicago might be best.\n6. I will be here August 6-7 and waiting.\n7 . Yes, indeed. Let’s!\n8. Oh, yeah ?\nI direct your attention to the current issue of the AASA. It reproduces a speech\nby Frank Pace, Jr.; I think you would be interested in his remarks and, in particular,\nthe flowery introduction testifying to his prominence. I did not realize , until now,\nthat Pace is also Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on National Goals\nand a member of Kennedy’s super Foreign Intelligence Board, which is the watchdog\nover the entire intelligence activities of the U.S. So, look out!\nCordially,\nWilliam G. Harley"
