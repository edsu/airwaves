I believe I\nknow you too well to suppose you would exhibit the extremely poor taste to\nuse an NAEB letterhead and your office in the NAEB to refer to ncn-NAEB\ndifferences we have had. In any case may I assure you that I am not aware\nof any \"communications\" from which I should like to withdraw a single line.\nYour last paragraph pays tribute to the NAEB's desire to serve all educational\nbroadcasters. I have heard much talk of this. Action, however, for ETV\nstations, has been hard to get. I shall await with considerable interest\nthe action, or lack of it, of a Board which I now believe will (finally) con¬\nsider some proposals to aid educational television.\nSincerely,\nJohn C. ichwarzwalder\nGeneral Manager"
