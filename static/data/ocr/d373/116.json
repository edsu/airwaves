The people of\nAppalachia, as much and possibly more than any\nother Americans, need effective mass interÂ¬\ncommunication of information which they will\nfind valuable in their lives. They need it as\nsoon as possible.\"\nThe title of Mr. Fellows' report is \"Educational\nBroadcasting As A Tool For Appalachian Development\",\nand was written in June of 1966."
