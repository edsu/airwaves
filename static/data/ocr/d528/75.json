Quayle\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York City, New York 10022\nDear Don:\nThis is a response to your May 19 letter re PBS and radio*s\ninvolvement therein. You asked for my comments re building in\nradio or insuring that strong provisions be made to include radio\nat some future time.\nIt seems to me the June 11 working paper prepared by CPB titled\nThe Public Broadcasting Network adequately insures that radio inter¬\nconnect!^ andneHTorOi’ngwrTT’emerg e. The language in part I-B is,\nin my mind, satisfactory. It says that PBS(N) fcAfcfutogelude radio —\nand that is all that is necessary at this time.\nHow we go about insuring the inclusion of radio is, then, the\nkey factor. Currently, we are in a holding action and there is no\nreason to expect or hope that developments in TV will be slowed,\ndelayed or halted while radio \"catches up\". That isn't realistic\nand Isn't going to happen — nor should it.\nThus, It seems that PBN-TV will continue to move ahead of\nPBN-Radio activity* No one concerned with radio should be alarmed\nso long as I-B is concurred in by all concerned.\nNow, then, do we get at this matter of Interconnection and\nnetworking. Some steps suggest themselves, and I list them for you.\n1. Identify \"public” radio stations by an appropriate set of\ncriteria.\n2. Initiate discussions on free or reduced rates for interconnec¬\ntion of all public radio stations.\n3. As step two is taken, form a planning group to develop\nprogramming concepts. Perhaps the Radio Advisory Council performs\nthis function.\n4. Establish production capability for network programs including\na news and public affairs bureau.\nff. When the reduced rate negotiation indicated in step two is\ncompleted and the production center has program materials ready for\ndistribution, begin networking.\n'’V"
