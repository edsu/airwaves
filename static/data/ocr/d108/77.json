Lerch\nIfey* Warfare Dot. 8239\nAPO 500\nc/o fbstmster\nSan Francisco, Calif.\nDear John*\nEnclosed you will find the result of your letter of August 20\nregarding promotion of your series. I trust what I have done is\nsatisfactory to you. Incidentally, though it is not enclosed, I\nsent (attached to the photo) an explanation of the picture.\nIf you wish to do another show in place of the cherry blossom\nprogram, it is perfectly all right with us, as I am sure we can\nchange the order of distribution. However, if you do a show on\nNew Tears over there, I would have to have the program by the\nfirst of December in order to get it to the stations in time for\nNew Yearns Day broadcast.\nThere is the possibility - and a very distance one - that the\nstations will hold the cherry blossom program until the spring}\nas a matter of fact, I wouldn*t be surprised if many stations\nheld the whole series until after the \"aw Year. Not very many\nstations carry the programs at the time we distribute them, most\nof them being anywhere from a month to a year behind us.\nI repeat, however, that if you wish to do another program, we will\nbe glad to distribute it and inform the stations of the timely\nnature of the cherry blossom program. Think it over, and let me\nknow what your decision is.\nI certainly was impressed by the announcement cards. The ordering\ndeadline is next Monday, and as soon as the votes are counted. I'll\nsend you a list of the stations taking the series.\nCordially,\nREU/ok\nEnclosures\nRobert E. Underwood, Jr.\nNetwork Manager"
