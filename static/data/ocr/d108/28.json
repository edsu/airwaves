Higgy, Director\nDr. Harry Skornia\nNAEB\nUrbana, Illinois\nHoward L. Bevis, President\nCOLUMBUS Id\nOctober 17\n1955\nDear Harry: *\nMany thanks for your good letter of Oct, II. What with\ncholera, tetanus, and typhoid raging through my system along\nwith wind-up details here at WOSU, you can imagine I’m slightly\nfeverish. Departure date from Columbus is now set at Oct. 25.\nI very much want to do the series mentioned on life in\nJapan; and as soon as I get to Tokyo will outline a few programs.\nIncidentally, they will be taped either in the Dept, of the Army\nradio station or at NHK, to insure good quality.\nRoughly, the format that I've been thinking about is this:\nMAIN ITEM: News in Japan ( approx. 5 min). A current topic\nor subject that is known in the US and of vital\nconcern in Japan. Timely and durable]\nSECOND ITEM: Key Figure Interview: 4-5 minute talk with an\nofficial, artist, architect or notable whom I\ncould meet let's say at the new International House\nbuilt by the Rockefeller Foundation.\nTHIRD ITEM: What's new in Japan: products, ideas, marketing methods,\nthis last a 5 minute feature department that underscores\noff-beat stiff be it music or pottery making in Kyoto.\nI plan to send the first tape to Mr. Seymour Siegel\nat WNYC; and I hope to have it properly \" produced” in Tokyo.\nNaturally, I'll let you know my address as soon as I\nhave it. Meantime, the permanent stateside address is: 1240\nBryden Road, Columbus, 5, Ohio.\nWould you kindly advise me of the best way to\nexpedite tape shipment through customs. If I label them ” for\neducational use, non- commercial” wouldn't they clear faster.\nc. Mr. Seymour Siegel"
