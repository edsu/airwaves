Since\nseveral thousand dollars of the increased annual NAEB expenses, as\nwell as your own, are due to the higher shipping charges this year for\nsound tapes beyond Zone 3, which represents nearly 2/3 of the tapes\nshipped to and from our Headquarters Office, some or all of you may be\ninterested in carrying on with this. The next to the last paragraph\nof Marcus0 October 13 letter explains why the NAEB as an organization\ncan not bring any pressures to bear in this instance. This does not\nprevent individual members from getting together outside the framework\nof the NAEB to see what can be done to get tapes and records, as well\nas films, to qualify for the lower rates which last year went into\neffect, but were not applicable beyond Zone 3*\nenclosures\nccs NAEB Officers\nCohn and Marks\nDAVI"
