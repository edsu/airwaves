Bee!\nNAEB Research Cj\nTelevision CeaefCer\nState Uniyp#sity of Iowa\nIowa Iowa\nNovember 22, 1961\n>am:\n1>J\nIn answer to your letter of November 15, I think that Harley's idea\nfor NAEB to set up a national audience survey office in Washington, D. C.\nis essentially a good one. The only question I guess I would have is why\nsuch an office should be limited to \"conducting surveys for local stations\nto determine the special requirements and wants of their audiences\". I am\nsure that this is a legitimate and often helpful kind of research activity\nbut I would think that an organization which was set up with broader research\naims and development might be better than one which was limited to audience\nresearch alone.\nIn terms of developing a possible NAEB research center, I think it\nmight also be well to consider the stated interest in research which has\nrecently come from NAB. President Collins of NAB, I believe, has set up a\ncommittee (with McGannon as chairman me thinks) which is presently discussÂ¬\ning a NAB sponsored Research and Training Center. This committee is now\nengaged in some conference and discussion regarding the research needs and\nproblems in broadcasting and whether such a center should be established at\nsome university or in Washington, D. C. or some other metropolitan area.\nThe Association for Professional Broadcasting Education has been quite\ninterested and active in this NAB development. If NAEB is going to develop\na research center, I think it might be well for Bill Harley to consult with\nand perhaps coordinate activity with Bruce Linton, President of APBE at the\nUniversity of Kansas and/or with someone who is involved with the parent\nNAB Research Committee."
