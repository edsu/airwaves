This probably\nwill be the only available answer to these enigmatic conditions.\"\nCarey B. Stabler, President\nLittle Rock University\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\"Our experience with operating Channel 71 has lead us to conclude\nthat.low-power, multiple channel broadcast television is a rela¬\ntively low cost solution to many of the problems which we face\non the campus. For example, our present enrollment of approxi¬\nmately 10,000 full-time students is expected to double in the\nnext decade. We will have to depend upon television to enable\nus to provide first-rate instructors to many of the classes.\nThe ubiquitiousness of broadcast television is a great asset in\nmeeting this problem.\"\n0. Ray Olpin, President\nUniversity of Utah\nSalt Lake City, Utah\n\"Through the experience of existing educational channels in\nMadison and Milwaukee, it has already been established that\ntelevision has served well the instructional purposes of educa¬\ntional agencies in a variety of ways and of all instructional\nlevels. With the increasing demands for educational opportunity\nmanifest in mounting enrollment and a growing interest in adult\neducation, we feel certain that television will prove to have\ncontinuing utility as an instrument of education.\"\n\"In Wisconsin, we anticipate particularly the future need to\nprovide for the sharing of educational resources through the\ninter-linking of the Madison campus to the University of Wis¬\nconsin campus at Milwaukee and with extension centers and state\ncolleges throughout the state. To accomplish this, it is our\nconviction that the best possible television channels must be\nmade available to the forces of education.\"\nL. H. Adolfson, Dean\nUniversity Extension Division\nUniversity of Wisconsin"
