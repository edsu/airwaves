(Occasionally,\nwesve had a series submitted rather casu almost apologetically, sub¬\nmitted—and immediately accepted by the ttee.)\nFrom time to time we receive letters from various stations and organiza¬\ntions outside of the NAEB which tell us of some series they contemplate\nproducing, and asking if we have any suggestions to make the series more\nsuitable for the Network* In such cases, m can say that our member sta¬\ntions seem to want quarter-hour shows* And now and then we hear of some\nseries of quarter-hour shows which might be of interest to NAEB Radio Net¬\nwork stations, and we can request a submission*\nThis is about as far as we at Headquarters can go to \"find many more quar¬\nter-hour programs*n After they are submitted, they must be passed on by\nthe Acceptance Subcommittee of the Radio Network Committee* And it may be\nthat any or all of the shorter programs submitted aa a result of our en¬\ncouragement will be re jecied—because such programs usually are weak* But\nsince the desire of our member stations for such programs is now explicitly\non the record, I don»t think we can ignore it* Perhaps we shall not be\nable to satisfy the desire, but I think we are bound to at least try*\nSincerely,\nJHscr\nJohn Holt\nNetwork Manager\nCC: Executive Director\nAssociate Director\nRadio Network Committee"
