In further discussions with NEA, they\nfeel the coverage would be premature.\nIn the case of the German elections, we have ascertained\nthat the program will be available to NERN without\ncharge. We have not yet decided whether or not the\nelection will be broadcast. It is clear that adequate\nsupport is available from sources other than CPB.\nIt was good to talk again on May 1. The NER Board will\ntake a number of actions at its meeting on May 13-14 that\nwill be of interest to the CPB staff.\nSincerely,\nRobert A. Mott"
