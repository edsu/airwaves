Y.\nJanuary 26, 1951\nMr* Graydon Ausmus\nWUOA\nUniversity of Alabama\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Graydon:\nI have Just returned from Washington to find your\nletter of January 23. I want first to tell you how\ngrateful I am to you for sending me copies of the letters\nyou received from Senator Sparkman and Representative\nElliott. You are doing a magnificent Job, and you should\nfeel extremely satisfied with it.\nYou probably have been reading the trade press about\nthe bomb-like effect which the NAEB TV study had, not only\non the Commission but also on the industry. The last word\nwhen I left Washington was MLet*s roll with this punch! \"\nI have asked Stuart Haydon to send you a copy of the study,\nwhich is an extremely impressive demonstration of the Smythe-\nHorton effort. This represents an expenditure of more than\n#4000.00 by NAEB, and as soon as I have the exact figure, I\nthink I should obtain formal approval by the members of the\nBoard. What do you think? This will be the only expenditure\nthat I have authorized outside of the funds authorized in the\nminutes of the last meeting.\nI shall eend invitations to all of the members of the\nCommission to be present at our Ean convention. These will\nnot go out, however, until I have some tefinite^i^ormation\nconcerning our financial status. I feijp*that wejmbre likely\nto obtain their presence if we offered to defray their\ntraveling expenses.\nOne of the sessions which I would like to see you run\nat the Fall meeting is a panel including George Rosen of\n\"Variety,” Jerry Francken of \"Billboard,” Frank Burke of\n\"Radio Daily,\" and possibly even the great Sol Taishoff of\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational AM and FM radio stations, workshops, and production centers,\nowned and operated by colleges, universities, and public-service agencies."
