Approximately 150 students are included in the station\noperation.\nThe number of hours of broadcasting has been steadily increased since\n19h2• At the present time, the AM transmitter is on the air 1? hours per day\n(7 a.m. to midnight), 365 days per year. The FM is used for simulcast\nfrom noon to midnight. The volunteer students operate the station while\nschool is in session. During vacation periods, a 6 man staff is paid\n$25*00 each per week to operate the station.\nTechnical Facilities\nOhio University operated a carrier current system which was discon¬\ntinued in June 1957* This system served most of the campus but was\nunsatisfactory for residential Athens. The transmitter operated on a\ncarrier frequency of 51*0 kilocycles. Radio frequency energy was carried on\nA.C. power lines for purpose of distribution. This system did not produce\nenough radiation into space to require a radio station license.\nWOUI-FM operates on a carrier frequency of 91*5 megacycles with an\neffective radiated power of ID watts. The transmitter designed by Gates\nis capable of high fidelity reproduction. The primary coverage extends\nto the city limits of Athens.\nWCUB operates on a carrier frequency of 131*0 kilocycles at a power of\n100 watts. The transmitter is a new Gates 250 watt transmitter. Application\nhas been filed with FCC to increase the power to 250 watts. This trans¬\nmitter is capable.of high fidelity AM broadcasting. WOUB has a primary\ncoverage of 390 square ijiiles within this area, serving a population of\n58,15k people. The secondary coverage is approximately 6 counties or\na 30 mile radius."
