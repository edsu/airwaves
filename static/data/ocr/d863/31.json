Preeminently Jefferson\nwas an apostle of freedom and economic freedom was no exception\nto his credo. Although Jefferson was more realistic than many have\nsupposed, the road to happiness for all sorts and conditions of men was\nharder than he thought. Here and there throughout the statesman's\nwritings is evidence -- much of it highlighted in this broadcast -- that\neconomic freedom was basic among the rights of man.\nV/ladimir Selinsky has composed and conducted the\nmusic for the score of \"Freedom to Work\", as usual using musical\ninterpretation to give emphasis to pertinent spoken passages of the\nwork and to help separate ideas. Frank Papp was the producer and\ndirector.\nThe narrative is based on the research, writings and\nadvice of Dr. Dumas Malone, Professor of History at Columbia University.\n3:"
