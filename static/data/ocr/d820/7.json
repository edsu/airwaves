Rickard\nPage 2\nNovember 12, 19A\nIn view of the capital outlay required to accomplish multiplexing at the\npresent tins, perhaps it would be well to survey the present Wisconsin edu¬\ncational FM network* We could also investigate the results obtained by\nsome of the consaercial regional FM networks used to transmit sports broad¬\ncasts, such as the Standard Baseball Network and also the Carling’s Foot¬\nball Network which originate in Cleveland, Ohio. These sports networks\nhowever do not provide the superior broadcast quality you mention since\nthey ensplcy Class \"IT telephone circuits to accomplish soiao of the longer\nhops.\nI realise that all the above is rather vague, however it does indicate\nthat we have not entirely forgotten your request. If you wish, I shall\ntry to get further information on transmission over FM networks, not nec¬\nessarily multiplexed, which on a regional or state basis might provide\nthe benefits outlined in your letter. Obviously there would be program¬\nming and coordination problems to be solved in addition to the technical\nones.\nYours very truly,\nCecil S.
