It is not so clear what\nproportions of these funds should be supplied by available sources, such as increases\nin tuition, individual gifts, corporate contributions, and appropriations by local,\nstate and federal governments.^ We urge The President’s Committee to study this problem\nand to make appropriate recommendations to the American people. We are confident that\nwhen the need is understood, the people will support a sound program of action to\nsupply the essential funds."
