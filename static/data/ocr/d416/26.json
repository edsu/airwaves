I just donH believe many stations thought\nthis through* I do regret the apparent intention to find ”many more quar¬\nter hour programs” for the Network. Since for the most part our stations\nare not concerned with commercial commitments, a large number of fifteen-\nminute programs just doesn^t make sense to me*\nAgain, congratulations for conducting the questionnaire* I think it shows\nthat all things considered, we are a rather orderly lot after all*\nSincerely,\n/s/ John\nJohn Young\nManager\nY/fx\nCopied at NAEB Hqs* on Mar, 15, 1955-cr"
