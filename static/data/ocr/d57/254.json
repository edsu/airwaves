Y.\nSept. 30,1957\nMr. Robert E* Underwood,Jr.,\nNetv/ork Manager,\nNat’l Association of Educational\nBroadcasters,\nUn. of Illinois,\n119 Gregory Hall,\nUrbana,Ill.\nDear Sir:\nYour letter of August 12tb. was laid\naside for reply after I had received word of\nacceptance or rejection of the radio progra\nThe Friendly Philosopher. Having had no in¬\ndication of the committee's reaction, I now\nfeel I should write you anyway.\nYour letter stated that neither your\nassociation nor its member stations can assume\nany costs in obtaining these programs. In turn,\nI am puzzled— hov^ do the producers who supply\nyour shows pay for them? Are they privately en¬\ndowed? Or are all these replays of shows which\nwere originally sponsored? I had assumed that\nyour group was backed or sponsored by a founda¬\ntion, which assumption appears false. If you can\nspare the time for a line or two, please en¬\nlighten me.\nOf course, your committee may find the\nprogram unsuitable,in which case our discussion\nis academic.\nThank you for your courtesy. I diall\nlook for the return of my tape and script,and,\nif possible, a note from you.\nYours sincerely\nGene von Hallberg\nfor Harmony Hall,Inc."
