In-school programs. How best to handle this problem? How to dis¬\ntribute them?\nSo Library service on old series and other items for which we can get\nnecessaiy clearances?\n6. Technical quality. We have a study under way of the means whereby\nwe can achieve a level of quality satisfactory to all concerned. We\nhope to publich a lengthy treatise soon on the subject which will estab¬\nlish as firm a set of standards as seems possible. Any suggestions?\n7» Should we have a firm policy on Governmental Information Office\nprograms? Or judge each on its merits? We currently have HOLLAND\nCALLING and the first of a Swiss series, A TRIP THROUGH SWITZERLAND.\n8. The proposed Air Forces program to be done by the Training ^ommando"
