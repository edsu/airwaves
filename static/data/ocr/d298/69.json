We have no point of view in the sense\nthat w© are categorically opposing the national Association of Broad¬\ncasters, but we do believe a statement demonstrating both the necessity\nof preserving free speech and at the same time pointing out the real\nresponsibilities attached to owners and operators of radio broadcast\nfacilities. I have in mind hsre some of the thinking of the Chicago\nfreedom-of-tl express report and also the \"scarcity theory\" which I\nbelieve exists and which the NAB denies.\nI wonder specifically what Fred Siebert could contribute to the preparation\nof a brief here in addition to whatever you yourself might suggest. I\nthink it might be possible if this interests you at all to arrange a\nChicago meeting with some people from Minnesota, Illinois, and the\nUniversity of Wisconsin to consider this further.\nI am writing Frank Schooloy in this same mailing and am asking him to\ncontact you. There is a small problem of relationship involved here as\nyou understand. *\nAnother and separate request, Wilbur, is with respect to the rather\nvoluminous and wordy report which I wrote for you on \"Serious Radio\".\nHave you had an opportunity to check it yet and. advise the registrar\nat Iowa City! There is no rush about this matter, but any time you do\nhave a moment to chock it, I would appreciate your reactions.\nSincerely,\nR. B. Hull\nPresident\nRBH:rmm"
