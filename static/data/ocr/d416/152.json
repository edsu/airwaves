Skornia\nDATE: September lh, 1955\nBy Board action a special Network assessment rate is now available to School sta¬\ntions. For one-half the rate normally charged for the full general network service,\nsuch stations are now eligible to receive the In-School series offerings of the NAEB\nRadio Network, plus a maximum of one hour per week selected from the general offer¬\nings. For example, a school station whose regular Network assessment is now $800.00\nper year (but which has been unable to use the full service and thus had difficulty\nin justifying payment of the full rate) may now subscribe for $1*00.00 per year in¬\nstead. For this latter sum the entire In-School service may be ordered, plus one\nhour per week of \"non-in-school\" programs.\nIt is of course our hope that as many as possible of you will take the full service.\nPlease let us know, on the chart below, which service you elect, and, if you have\nalready paid the full fee and now select the reduced service, how you wish to have\nyour overpayment handled.\n.X^)^xBBBBBBBBBBBB>BBB)BBBBBBBBBBBX-XBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBXBBXBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBX->BXBBBBBBBBBi-\nStation City .... _\nPower _ Address\nReport by __\nDo you wish to continue the regular service (if so check here_) or to take\nonly the half-rate service outlined above (check here^_J?\nDo you wish to have your overpayment, if any refunded (if so check here_),\nor credited to next year*s account (in this case, check here_J?\nIf you have not paid, or wish to join or rejoin the Network, and wish to have a\n(new) bill issued, please check here (_).
