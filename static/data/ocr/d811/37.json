  "text": "-7-\ncore of broadcasters, a nucleus for a truly professional association,\nand Insurance against a repetition of the earlier fate of educational radio.\nAs will be noted, many of these seminars and workshops had to be conducted by\nthe NAEB itself, with funds from. the W. K. Kellogg and the Ford Foundations,\nbecause of the absence, in educational institutions, of mechanism,\ncourses, personnel, and curricula for tills type of training. In this role,\nhowever, the NAEB has sought to serve mainly as a catalyst and example\nto provide the stimulus for the introduction of such courses in the curricula\nof educational institutions, themselves. To supplement this catalytic\neffort, in recent years, grants-in-aid were awarded to colleges and uni¬\nversities to permit them to up-grade radio and television workshops they\nwere by 1958 beginning to hold, by adding outstanding consultants or staff\nmembers to what they would otherwise have been able to do.\nThe results of these efforts, particularly in the areas of production,\nprogramming and technical operation, are now encouragingly apparent.\nAs this objective approaches realization, as it now does. In nearly all\nareas except the training of teachers —* both those who broadcast and\nthose who utilize broadcast-lessons — in accordance with the uncompromising\nstandards which the NAEB has sought to establish by example, the NAEB\ncan once again concentrate on the achievement of its role as a professional\nassociation of these professionally-trained individuals with the highest\nstandards which a respected profession can devise. This involves the\ndevelopment of standards, qualifications and classifications for indi¬\nvidual NAEB professional membership as described later in this document."
