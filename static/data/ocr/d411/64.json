Since 12% of the total sample\ndidnâ€™t answer their phones, it can be assumed that they were not\nat home, and therefore not listening to their radios,\n2. There was an apparent lack of ability on the part of the\nrespondents to estimate the number of hours they listened to WOJI\nper week, (question 2a) There is also a known prejudicial effect\nwhen a person is asked about a specific station before he estimates\nthe number of hours he listens to that station as was done in the\ncase of question 2a. Both these factors tend to minimize the\nstability of the response to this question.\n3. It will be noted in answer to question 2b that the majority of the\nlisteners listen to \"vOUI on AM. This may be due in part to the\ninability of respondents to know whether they listened on AM or on\nM. It also may be due in part to the fact that some of the\nhones in Athens were able to receive the signal of the carrier\ncurrent on the standard AM receiver."
