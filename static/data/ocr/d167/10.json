I hope that you, Roy Johnston,\nHolt Ridoleberger and l (we’ve lost James Petersen to Ohio\nUniversity) can get together during September for preliminery\nRegional Council Committee meeting before full session at\nNAEB convention in Washington.\nThose who would encourage \"area conferences\" do NOT\nMEAN TO DOWNGRADE REGIONAL CONFERENCES* As YOU NO DOUBT KNOW,\nsome Regions do not hold annual conferences and others, given\nthe OPPORTUNITY AND THE FINANCING FOR SOME SPECIAL NAT lONAL—APPE AL\nSESSION, WILL COMBINE THEIR REGIONAL CONFERENCES WITH OBJECTIVES\nHAVING A BROADER APPEAL, INCLUDING MEMBERS IN AREAS NEAR THE\nConference site* Our National Board needs to do some discussing\nANO COORDINATION OF CONFERENCE DATES TO AVOID TOO MANY MEETINGS\nAND TOO MUCH DUPLICATION. THIS NEED NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON OUR\nRegion Two 1966 Conference — in which, incidentally, Region Three\nIS NOT INTERESTED BECAUSE IT HIS ALREADY SET ITS DATE FOR MaRCH 24-\nWE ARE COUNTING ON YOUR GOOD PROGRAM-COORDINATING IDEAS\non the \"Regional Council\" which is the name that the Constitution\nsays our \"Executive or Steering Committee\", established at\nWilliamsburg, must have. I*m going to try to call you and the\nother members of the \"Council\" together before too long — as\nsoon as we can get ETS to formally disignate Holt Ridoleberger\n(reportedly satisfactory to them) as the ETS Region Two Council\nMEMBER *\nLooking forward always to working with you.\nSincerely,\nJim Etheridge\nJPE/hs"
