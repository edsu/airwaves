Glad you stand by your gune.\nMy fear re so many video tapes: Marshall would never get that many\ndone (unless they were pretty inadequate). Or else there would be\ntoo many of them to test adequately on several different groups.\nLike you, my fingers ache from being kept crossed on this. I do\nhope Foshay has specific items of testable nature.\nAs I expect you agree, I can't revise the contract, because I still\ndon't know costs, etc. I agree it must include a qualified researcher\non the team â€” but am not sure they'd expand it that much5 in that\ncase we'd need to add researcher(s) on consultant basis.\nYou're no more tired of this than I, I assure you. Let's hope\nMarshall comes up with something soon.\nBest,\nHarry J. Skomia\nExecutive Director\nHJSsJp\nCC: Mr. William G. Harley"
