Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nI have finally completed the European trip expense\naccount which is enclosed. I trust it will be processed\nrather quickly inasmuch as I have quite a bit of money out\nfor travel and more trips coming up in the near future.\nThe Board had approved up to $300.00 for this trip and\nthe total, $199.39, is well under that amount. The hotel\nand food in connection with the Paris trip are not strictly\na part of the Brussels meeting, but I would have spent as\nmuch or more had I stayed in Brussels for that weekend so I\nfeel justified in including this. Naturally, I have not\nincluded the difference in transportation which I paid but\nhave simply listed the round trip fare from London to Brussels\nand back to London.\nI have listed hotel charges in New York both going and\ncoming and limousine and taxi charges while in New York and\nam taking care of the round trip fare from home to New York\npersonally. Although I received $1,000.00 from Mr. Fletcher\nfor the London trip, I am short on actual expenses about\n$150.00 above the approximate $100.00 which I spent for gifts\nand for personal items. Even though I can ill afford to do\nso, I am perfectly willing to lose the $150.00 for the\nsatisfaction I got from making the trip. The items under\ntaxis and tips are rather staggering in their total number\nalthough the totals are not high. You know as well as I,\nhowever, the difficulties of traveling by street transporta¬\ntion in a foreign city and you are also aware of the cursed\ntipping demands involved in European travel.\nMore details on other business later.\nMy kindest regards.\nGA/jeh\nSineerely,\nGr* „\nPresident, NAEB\ncc: Members of the Board"
