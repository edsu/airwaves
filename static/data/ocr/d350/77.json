What little I know of Earl and some of\nthe few contacts that I have had with him, he impresses me as being\na pretty solid individual. I had thought of him in connection with\nthe position but quickly dismissed it when I felt that he had\nundoubtedly too good a position there at North Carolina. I do hope\nthat you will find all of his references satisfactory for I certainly\nwould be heartily in favor of Earlls appointment to the position.\nI trust by now that you have received the Memorandum which Cousin\nParker sent out through Cousin Burton. Incidentally, I hope that\nyou chastize him for not dating the memo. This does not please\nme in the least and I shall and will speak vigorously against it\nfor I do not think that it takes care of the existing problem one\nbit. I think it is a very half-hearted and namby-pamby attempt\nto solve a pressing problem. I am taking along plenty of money\nto Minneapolis so I can bail myself out of jail in case I talk\ntoo much with the gentleman from New York. Of course, I don’t\ntake Si to seriously but it is a funny thing to me that he has to\njump on everybody in the organization from time to time in an\nattempt to swing the ”big stick”. The fact that he has gone to\nEurope and is in New York doesn’t impress me in the least. So\nI believe there will be some very warm sessions in the pre-con¬\nvention clam bake. See you then.\nCordially yours.\nJohn W. Dunn, Director\nEducational Broadcasting Services\nJWD/bg"
