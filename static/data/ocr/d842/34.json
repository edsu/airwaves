Go around the room and give each person, in turn, an opportunity to state what\nstruck him as the highlights of the program. Pause briefly to give other persons\npresent an opportunity to comment on each statement.\n2. When this \"round robin\" has been completed, open the discussion for anyone to\nraise additional questions hanging over from previous programs.\n3. The recordings presented certain \"universals\" which exist in all human socie¬\nties. Can everyone in your group identify these universals? Do they agree\nthat these are the universals?\n4. Finally, one last question. Do you agree that you can't change human nature?\n39"
