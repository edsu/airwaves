  "text": "A HE Asia Foundation is a non-political,\nnon-profit organization incorporated under the\nlaws of the State of California. Its main office is\nlocated in San Francisco, with a branch office\nin New York City. Representatives are main¬\ntained in a number of Asian countries.\nThe Foundation was organized in March,\n1951, by a group of San Francisco citizens as the\nCommittee for Free Asia. In October, 1954, its\nArticles of Incorporation were revised and its\nname was changed to reflect the organization’s\ndevelopment and the Trustees’ conviction that\nthere exists a continuing need for the type of ac¬\ntivities in which it engages.\nThe Foundation therefore invites the con¬\ntinued support of Asians and Americans in the\npromotion of its purposes as set forth in its\nArticles of Incorporation:\na. To make private American support\navailable to individuals and groups\nin Asia who are working for the at¬\ntainment of peace, independence,\npersonal liberty, and social progress.\nb. To encourage and strengthen active\ncooperation, founded on mutual re¬\nspect and understanding, among vol¬\nuntary organizations—Asian, Ameri¬\ncan, and international—with similar\naims and ideals.\nc. To work with other American in¬\ndividuals and organizations for a bet¬\nter understanding in the United\nStates of the peoples of Asia, their\nhistories, cultures, and values."
