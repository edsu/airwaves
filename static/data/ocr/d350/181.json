Please let me have your ideas concerning\na successor who wou'd be prepared to carry the project\nthrough for a period of four years.\nWith best wishes.\nSeymour N. Siegel\nPresident\nSNSjLG\nP.S. The pressings of discs in the Jefferson series are\nnot meant to exclude the use of tape in the distribution\nof the programs to our member stations. Discs are basically\npromotional items which might also be income producing\ninsofar as commercial stations are concerned. 1 agree\nwith you that we ought not to delay things. A guy called\nEdmund Burke said that \"The only thing necessaiy for the\ntriumph of evil is that good men do nothing\". Tou say it\nin a much more succinct manner.\nHave a good vacation,"
