  "text": "This beguiling fact, attested by many who have known Japan\nbest and longest, was impressed on me when I returned to\nthis country a few months ago. On the boat were people who\nhad lived in Tokyo for many years, and others coming here\nfor the first time. Both groups had visited many of the\nfabled places of the world—from Europe to kHongkong.\nIt would have been difficult to decide which category of\ntraveller vras the most anxious to get ashore. The strange\nlure which Japan exercises on so many minds is in evidence\naround the world — I've met many people in many lands\nwho knew Japan in former days and upon whom this country\nhas left a deep and abiding imprint. For you see, there is r\nsuch a thing (call it a cliche if you will) as the \"lure\nof the Orient\". By comparison with most of Europe — and\nstill more so the well-to-do cities of the United States-\nJapanese towns are dirty, drab, over-populated, and lacking\nin elementary facilities. The country’s roads are for the\nmost part not worthy of the name. Tokyo’s stores are colorful,\nbut a sad letdown after the States.\nYet, the fact remains that the magnetic tug of Japan triumphs\nover these disadvantages, and large numbers of Westerners\nsee this country as a most fascinating and attractive land —\na nation in which they can feel more completely at home than\nin many of the better-endowed places of the earth. People\nwho can turn their backs upon the cities of Europe without\na qualm, admit they seldom depart Japan’s shores without\na certain sadness of parting — and return here with a\nwarm inner feeling of contentment. The explanation of this\nphenomenon lies, I believe not in the material but the\nmental sphere - in the atmosphere created by the Japanese\npeople and the nation’s conduct of its daily life.\nReturning to Japan after two years in the States, 1 am (again)"
