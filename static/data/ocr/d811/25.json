Director\nNational Ass'n. of Educational Broadcasters\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nAs we review your proposal for a continuation of financial\nsupport we are wondering if you have taken any steps to\norganize your Association so that it can receive and administer\ndirect Foundation funds which would entitle you to a certificate\nfrom the Internal Revenue Service indicating your qualifications\nfor receiving tax exempt funds. I notice that throughout the\nperiod of our grant the University of Illinois has served as\nyour fiscal agent. Is it also serving as your fiscal agent for\nfunds which you receive from other foundations? Perhaps your\nAssociation has a policy with respect to a development which\nwould lead to your own certification from the Internal Revenue\nService.\nSincerely,\nMFS/fh\nMaurice F, Seay"
