Fellows\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashingtoh 36, D.C.\nMiss Morris\nDear Jims\nAs Marjerie is currently scheduled to leave the U.S.\nand return to England on Wednesday, 3 July, she would be\nvery grateful if you could arrange for her check for the\nsecond half of her June salary and that for her travel\nexpenses on the Washington trip to be mailed to her this\nFriday, 28 June, if possible, so that she can cash them\nbefore she leases.\nMarjerie has indicated that it may be possible for her\nto devote another month to this project, either here or in\nEngland* She has done excellent work so far, and it would\nbe highly advantageous if she could continue to work with\nme until the end of July, when the 39â€”script intonation,\netc. series is due to be completed. Retaining her would\nsave locating and breaking in someone else, and would help\nto insure a consistent development throughout the series.\nIf she remains in New York, we could continue to work\ntogetha: just as we have been. (There would be no visa\nproblem, because the Immigration Service extended her visa,\nwith permission to work on this project, for six months.)\nHowever, we have worked out an alternative system which\nshould be quite satisfactory, should she return to England\nand do her part there.\nI would therefore urge you to continue her employment\nfor an additional month if she does prove to be available.\nShe expects to be able to state definitely within the next\nfew days whether she can give us the additional month, and\nI will wire you as soon as she decides.\nSincerely.\n0. Dean Gregory"
