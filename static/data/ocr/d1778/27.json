Do things that will\npay off by doing things that will convinoe the right people.\nPre-school level:\nAlways a call for educational programs for this group. We find\nthat children choose and prefer cowboy shows and the like in spite of\nwhat we may do to provide ’’good” TV programs. KUHT has one of the best\nstorytellers for pre-school listeners, but the program has a very small\naudience. Very little pressure is brought to bear to make children\nwatch Mgoodn ETV.\nSchool systems have little space and budget to devote to pre¬\nschool work. Maybe television can offer an answer. Form regional city\nkindergartens each with ten or twelve children under a part-time teacher.\nThese groups could meet in churches or other non-school buildings and\nwatch a TV series of on-going educational content in which eaoh show\nbuilds on the others. Pre-schoolers would get well planned instruction\non TV and have a good social and physical environment. This would free\nthe kindergarten classrooms in every school building. No teacher would\nbe put out of work. Local live production would usually be needed under\nsuch a plan.\nElementary Level:\nTeachers on the early elementary level are supposed to be\nexpert teachers, child psychologists, professional musicians, artists,\nand so on. Television oan help out in many of the specialized activities.\nWhile the classroom teacher is working directly with one seotion of a\nclass, another section oan be receiving useful instruction by television."
