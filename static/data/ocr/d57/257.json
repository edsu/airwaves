The series LIVIRO AMERICA has\nn^, I regret to say, been approved for distribution tooour member stations.\nAfter reviewing the submission, the ccomittee felt that idiile the subject\nmatter was vital and significant, the method of presentation was open to\nquestion, the order of questions being too diffuse and Inocncluslve. Further¬\nmore, since this lype ot interview series is being done over many local\nstations with great effectiveness, the committee doubted that such a series\noffered <m the imtwxk would ffnd much response. Therefore, the coBaaittee\nrecoDBsended that we not offer this series.\nAnother unfortunate ineid^t regarding tads scNries is that two of the three\ntapes sent to us by Mr. Seidner have been lost in the mail idiile in return\nto us from committee aembCT^s. Since we assuzas fUll responsibility for this,\nwe are returning the remaining audition tape plus two brand now reels of\ntape. Please accept our apologies for this.\nSincerely,\nHEU/dfo\nRobert E. UUderwood, Jr,\nNetwork Manager"
