SIEGEL, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\nBEFORE THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF MUSEUMS, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, MAY 31, 1951, S PM\nMr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:\nI know a great many museum people. None of them really have horns. It*s true\nthat I have never Been able to forgive the architects of museums who seem always able\nto construct cold and cheerless marble halls where one is supposed to enjoy oneself\n*\nlooking at pictures or exhibits.\nI still have one fallen arch that cannot be attributed to military service,\nbecause museum people seem to enjoy subjecting all of us to such tortures of foot\nweariness as no one even in the Army should be forced to endure.\nFurthermore, museum curators seem to obtain some special sort of pleasure\nby denying people the simple solace of a smoke — no one can talk above a whisper\nin a museum — and it‘s sheer heresy to indicate that there are mighty few museums\nsmart enough to install a friendly little bar somewhere on the premises.\nThen there*s the slight little indignity of being counted as you go in through\na turnstile — and the X-ray checking you as you go out. In between, of course,\nthere are special guards who are perfect examples of FBI people on the trail of\nespionage agents-Just how happy can you expect ordinary people to be under such\ncircumstances? How can people really like what they see under these terminal con¬\nditions?\nIt is for these reasons that the media of mass communications present an\nopportunity and a challenge. They reverse the situation completely by substituting\nall the comforts of home as the learning environment. It is because radio and\ntelevision are tools which you can use to accomplish what I think is your aim that\nI hope to be able to give part of the answer to the problem of education ... which\nis tonight*s topic."
