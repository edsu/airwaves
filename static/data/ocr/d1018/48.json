Hess(continued)\nDivision, realizing these problems, has met again since the\nmeeting in Columbus, and Charlie McIntyre is currently preparing\na \"Newsletter\" to send to memberÂ© of the Instructional Division\nexplaining plans for member services. He is also preparing a\nquestionnaire to go to non-members to determine what services\nthey would like to see the NAEB provide. The Board will then\nevaluate the responses as they plan for new services for the\nInstructional Division.\nI hope this letter does not appear to be defensive. I certainly\ndo not intend for it to be that way, but am merely trying to\nexplain some of the problems being faced by the new Division and\nindicate some of the steps they have already taken.\nI am sure that Dick Jbewls and other members of the Board would\nwelcome any ideas you have. You can be sure that the staff will\nattempt to do some missionary work on the West Coast*\nThanks for your help, Gary. We appreciate your keeping us\nabreast of the situation.\nCordially,\nHarold E. Hill\nHEH/alm"
