Mien these facilities are tied to the teaching functions of a specific\ndepartment, that department usually is responsible for the facilities and their\nuse. The audio-visual director frequently acts as consultant in the selection,\npurchase, and installation of equipment*\nAn overview will be given in this section of audio-visual facilities for\n(1) classrooms, (2) auditoriums, (3) teaching materials centers in schools of\neducation, (U) reading clinics, (5) speech and hearing clinics, and (6) modern\nlanguage laboratories.\nClassrooms\nEven when teaching materials and equipment are available on a campus,\nthey may go unused if classrooms are not equipped to insure easy and satisfac¬\ntory use. This is particularly true of audio and projected materials.\nIt is seldom possible to adapt all classrooms in older buildings on a\ncampus at one time for the use of modern teaching tools. A starting goal\nshould be the equipping of at least one classroom on each floor of each class¬\nroom building. Each year a few more classrooms can be adapted."
