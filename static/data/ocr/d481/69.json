Harley\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nDuPont Circle Building\n131+6 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Bill:\nIt was with great regret that I was unable to attend the Board\nof Directors meeting during the past week in Milwaukee; however,\nI am certain that Ken Christiansen relayed my message to you that\nit was impossible because of a Board of Education meeting in\nDenver. As you probably know, this body takes priority over ANY\nmeeting.\nFirst, I wish to indicate that I heartily concur with the stand\nyou have taken regarding the many ramifications concerning the\nposition of the NAEB in the Wilmington conflict. I have studied\nthese communications and recognize that you have handled this\nmatter in a very diplomatic manner.\nI have one suggestions regarding the activities of your office\nconcerning relaying of information to the various members of\nthe organization. I have been asked regarding details of certain\nconflicts that have arisen and have purposely not answered. I\nfeel it is unfair to the organization, as well as the officers,\nfor any single board member to be the dissemination factor\nregarding such controversies. Very often information gained from\nseveral sources is of detriment to any organization.\nI sincerely hope that relaying of information of this type\nshould be submitted from the central office rather than from its\nvarious elected representatives. You may wish an approval from\neach member of the Board regarding your suggested communication\nfor your own protection, but I feel this is a much better method\nof giving information than for each board member to submit details\nto his particular constituents.\nMy best wishes for your continued success in a job which you are\ndoing very well.\nHLJ:pm"
