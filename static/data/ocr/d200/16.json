Skornia\nProfessor of Radio and Television\n24 Gregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nReferring to your semi-literate scribbles of September 17th,\nI will take them up in order—insofar as I can decipher them.\n1* I will be in a JCEB meeting on October 2nd but will be\nfree on October 4th when you return. If you can come to the office\nthen, I can take you to the airport. Or meet you at the airport.\nOr whatever is most convenient on that afternoon. Perhaps you can\nphone the office when you arrive on the 2nd and leave word. In\nfact, since Warrenton is not too far away, I might even be able to\ndrive down one evening, if you are not going to be busy every night.\nI was down in Warrenton last Saturday—mighty pretty country.\n2. I don’t know what to do about the UNESCO nominations, since\nthe Committee only named one, as per my understanding of what was\nrequired. I have written to Hull to ask for his suggestions.\nFrankly, I would like to succeed you in this position but I am\nhesitant about pushing my own candidacy.\n3. I have written to Jean Eicks and will take her up on her\noffer to introduce me to the Director of the Asia Society. I will\nalso suggest to Burton, as Vice Chairman, that he hold a meeting\nof the International Relations Committee at Philadelphia.\n4. We hope to set up arrangements with AID for TV and radio\nfor training of foreign nationals and such an arrangement would\nprovide for subcontracting with member institutions in such ;a way\nthat funds would be provided for secretarial and other administrative\ncosts involved. I take it you never composed a memo along this line.\nI will look forward to seeing you in connection with your visit\nto Warrenton and Hope we have 5the opportunity for a good chat.\nCordially,\nWilliam G, Harley"
