Other logical steps that would\nbe appropriate as funds become available include the\nre-establishment of the NERN Public Affairs Bureau,\ndevelopment of a national production center, initiation\nof live radio networking to a group of non-commercial\nradio stations.\nA revised proposal to replace our submittal in Sept¬\nember, 1968, requesting funds for the NERN Public Affairs\nBureau is now being prepared and will be in your hands\nin the near future.\nI look forward to seeing you on January 28.
