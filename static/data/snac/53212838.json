The collection primarily focuses on Schooley's forty-three year career in educational and public broadcasting at the University of Illinois and his professional involvement in various organizations. Frank Ellsworth Schooley started his distinguished career in educational broadcasting and journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1929.  Soon, he was given the daily responsibility of running the radio station WILL.   In 1948, Schooley succeeded station manager Joseph Wright.  When WILL-TV began in 1955, he became Director of Broadcasting, a position held until 1972.  Schooley's other professional activities included a long affiliation with the National Association of Educational Broadcasters.  His positions included executive secretary, president, treasurer, and board member.  He also served on the Joint Council on Educational Television in the 1950s.  Finally, in 1968, President Johnson appointed him to the Board of Directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as the only educational broadcaster.
