Realizing\nthu.s, the NAEB conducted, in 1952, a School Broadcast Seminar which dealt with\nthe general problems of in—school broadcasting. In 195U the Association conducted\na seminar for writers of in-school programs. During the summer of 1958 a Seminar\non the Instructional Uses of Television and Radio was held for producers of in—\nschool programs and for representatives of teacher-training institutions con- ^ t\\\ncemed with teaching methods courses, (See section VII of this request for\npertinent recommendations made by the participants in this seminar).\nIn cooperation with Purdue University, the NAEB held a seminar on instruc¬\ntional television, at the university level, during the summer of 1958; and earlier-’\nin the year participants in an NAEB Research Seminar voiced concern over the lack\nof coordinated efforts in this area and the lack of definitive guide posts and\nresponsible experimentation on a national scale.\nCommendable as these first efforts have been, they were only tentative\nand exploratory first steps in what must be many successive and adequately\nfinanced efforts in this field, if the best knowledge of the nation is to be\nshared, and if new techniques are to be developed by practice and demonstration,\nwith actual teachers involved. There is a definite and urgent need for a\nconcentrated program of experimentation and training as proposed here. The\nproblem becomes more acute as more educational stations and closed circuit in¬\nstallations begin operation, and as more and more new teachers are pressed into\nservicec"
