But media study must go on*1 And so far the only advice is\nto shut up*\nIt is sometimes said that my approach to media is philosophical*\n1 hope it may soon be seen to be scientific. For a long time philosophy\nhas been associated with systems, with world-views, weltanschaungs, and\ngeneral pictures of things. Since the Renaissance most methods and pro¬\ncedures have strongly tended toward stress on the visual organization\nand application of knowledge* Printing gave enormous stress to such\nvisual process, to differential calculus, and to statistics*\nBut since the early nineteenth century with the arrival of electri¬\ncal problems and processes, mathematics and physics have moved away from\nvisual organization and statistics towards dynamics, time organization,\nand what psychologists refer to as \"auditory space.\" (Auditory space\nis that sphere of simultaneous relations created by the act of hearing*\nWe hear from all directions at the same instant* This creates a unique\nunvisualisable space.)\nTo ask whether either the Renaissance achievement of statics or\nour modem conquest of dynamics is a good thing or a bad thing seems to\nmean: \"what will this do to me?\" The question seems to be a request for\napplied knowledge, but knowledge applied on one level, and for one per¬\nson ££* *!*■"
