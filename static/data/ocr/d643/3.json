Executive Committee asked\nthree or four questions reg rding future status of Journal* 1*11\ntry to give my best guesses, or state my personal opinions relat¬\ning to questions and problems.\nI believe the Journal ought to pay for Itself. I believe it\ncan pay for itself. I believe it will take a little time before\nwe can be sure, or get it to place we are sure it is and will\ncarry its own load.\nI believe that Journal should be able to count on ’i3«25 from\neach subscription and from each individual membership for Its own\nuse. This is an arbitrary figure, selected by me because it is\nthe base figure used when agencies get subscription discounts,\ni.e., agency pays only #3*25 for each sub, keeps 75 cents.\nI believe subscription list can be built up materially—in\ntime.\nI believe product can always be as good as now, and I actually\nbelieve it can be Improved.\nI do not believe we can count on much advertising income\nwithin the forseeable future. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't\ntry. Bight now full-page rate Is £100. That's ten cents per\nreader per issue, and that's TOO high.\nBelated to Journal are individual memberships, and I shall\ncomment more fully in relation to Miles' committee letters. In\nbrief, I believe we can build up greatly.\nAlso, I repeat I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to carry\non where we are now going with Journal and with individual memberships.\nFurther, I believe we can carry on. Improve, and build up.\nRegards,\nFrank E. Schooley\nFES: rib\nCC: Skomia"
