Other aids produce the effect of tiny waves, or\nassist in the building of stone walls.\nThe trays on which the landscapes are displayed are generally\nrectangular> though sometimes oval-shaped. Superior ones\nare of bronze. The trays have low legs but no holes, and\nore placed on slightly larger wooden boards. Isnâ€™t this\ncorrect, Mr. Tnkcnaka?\nYes it is. Japanese make the landscapes while in a sitting\nposition on the matted floor. The troy is placed on a small\ntable about two foot in height, two foot long, and one and\na half wide. In the table are two or three drawers, and it\nis especially designed with a revolving top to enable the\nmaker tc turn the tray without lifting it, as the sides\nand back of the landscape are supposed to bo equally neat\nand attractive.\nJapan is rich in mountains, so we find on many trays mountains\nof some description. Mount Fuji, of course, is again and\nagain represented, and the Japanese never tiro of it.\nFujisan, although seen so often in reality and in picture,\nis difficult to execute due tc the subtleness of its peak\nand slopes.\nThe beautiful red of the shrines\nand torii could not bo made bettor, iill the many different\nbuildings boar the closest examination, inside and out,\nsome are particularly interesting for realistic touchos,\nsuch as a doer with loose hinges or a fallen roof tile.\n( 6 )"
