  "text": "course, in such a mutual organization as ours, this is the\nwrong order of things. We'll only get what we ourselves\nplan and pay for. Nor has our failure been as much in the\npaying as it has in the planning. We're not sure of what\nwe want. I think it is partly because we are not sure of\nwhat we are.\nHaving thus come full circle X am about to quit. It is my\npicture of ourselves that despite our nominal allegiance to\na national concept of educational broadcasting, we tend\ntoward isolation from each other in respect to group will and\neffort. We speak constantly of the need for a national net¬\nwork to strengthen our programming while most of use are\npurchasing at least a» muclg programming from ether agsneie^ ^ ,\nPerhaps this is the easy way out . . . getting the best\navailable for the best price. However, we splinter our\ncause and dilute our product this way. Our only salvation\nas a national force is to direct our own program destiny.\nWe must devote talk leading, hopefully, to action to construct\na national network mirroring our educational broadcasting\nimage. t would seem logical to begin with a search for the\nimage.\nI did not mean to launch into such exposition, Ken and others on the\npanel, but rereading it I find it does cover the ground I, for one,\nhad in mind. I leave it to you to order the agenda for Friday after¬\nnoon. I hope you311 help me then to reorder it for Saturday morning\non the basis of Friday’s discussion.\nLooking forward to seeing you at Tampa.\nMost cordially.\nX Leonard Press\nOLP/es"
