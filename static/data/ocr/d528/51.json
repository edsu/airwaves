Hulsen\nDirector Radio Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n1345 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York City, New York 10019\nDear Als\nThanks for the thoughtful note to Miss kandreth regarding\nthe NERN quarterly offering* Reaction has been quite favorable\nnationally*\nSorry your Canadian trip makes it impossible for youtto\nattend the open house* 1*11 give you a one minute summary when\nI see you next at our meeting with the BBC people. Please let\nme know what you. Frost and Gillard come up with in Toronto.\nFor some advance thought X want to advise you that in all\nprobability, the NER Board of Directors will be increased from\nsix to eight effective January 1, 1970* This assumes that the\nNAEB membership votes a by &aws change adjusting membership on\nthe ETS and NER Boards. Purpose of the change is to provide\nfor a simple means of moving from the division board to the\nNAEB executive board.\nThe impact of this on CPB is that it would enlarge the\nRadio Advisory Council by two starting in 1970. I wanted you\nto be aware of the change* It is something we should discuss\nbetween now and convention time.\nSincerely,\n%\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:kh\nccs Fellows\nEstell"
