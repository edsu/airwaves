Hurlbert\nGeneral Manager\nAlabama Educational Television Commission\n807 Protective Life Building\nBirmingham 3, Alabama\nDear Ray:\nI want to tell you officially how much I enjoyed being\nat Atlanta for the NAEB Region II Conference, even though my stay\nwas unavoidably short. The evidence of advance organization, and\nthe very good turnout, combined with the nature of the discussions\nwhich I was privileged to hear, all augured well. I took the oc¬\ncasion to report to our staff meeting this morning that, so far as\nmy observations led, the NAEB's officers and staff and its volunteer\nleaders had done a first-rate job on this meeting.\nI hope that in one way or another my presence indicated\nmy own personal interest and that of the Center in continued co¬\noperative efforts toward our common goals.\nBest regards.\nSincerely,\nJames Robertson\nDirector of Station Relations\nJR:bv\nWilliam G. Harley\nHarry J. Skoraia"
