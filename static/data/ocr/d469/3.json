(Section 392(c) (1) and (2).)\n(b) State educational television or radio agency may itself be an\napplicant for a facilities grant under P.L. 90-129.\n(3) By letter dated October 15, 1968, the Commissioner of Education has re¬\nquested each Governor to inform his office of the agency officially designa¬\nted to act as the State educational television or radio agency. In order\nto assure efficiency in planning and coordination of educational broadcasting\nprojects at the State level, the designation of a single agency with responsi¬\nbility for both radio and television has been encouraged.\n(4) The counsel and comments of many State educational television agencies\nhave proved invaluable in past administrative experience during the life of\nthe original ETV Facilities Act (P.L. 87-447). As telecommunications needs\nand demands for spectrum space increase throughout the country for a multitude\nof communications purposes, the role of a State educational broadcasting\nagency assumes increasingly greater importance. In the administration of the\nEducational Broadcasting Facilities Program (Title I, P.L. 90-129), State\nplanning conducted by such agencies, and the counsel of such agencies\nwith respect to the merits and priorities among applications from a given\nState will continue to be given serious consideration in the determination\nof grant awards. In addition to fulfilling the requirement that applica¬\ntions must be filed with the appropriate State agency, applicants are\nencouraged to coordinate television and radio planning and Federal grant\nrequests with such agencies."
