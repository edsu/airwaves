Put another way,'\nthis means that there was a 4 per cent, gain at the level of actually volunteering\nthe correct meaning and a further 7 per cent, at the level of merely recognising\nthe right word (i.e., if it were seen). The score for factual knowledge rose from\n9-1 out of twenty-nine to 10-1 (a gain of about 5 per cent.). Examples of the\nquestions asked have already been given and it may be taken that the score of\n9*1 means that viewers had, prior to the broadcast, a reasonable grasp of-a little\nless than a third of the facts on which questions were asked.\nA number of' circumstances appear to have contributed to the relative\nsmallness of these gains—-circumstances which, it is important to note, are likely\nto dominate or to condition those teaching programmes which are meant to reach\na wide or general viewing public. In the first place, ‘ Bon Voyage ’ was presented\nwithin the context of a larger, regular Tuesday programme for housewives.\nWhile this gave it a wide audience, it seems unlikely that the persons exposed to\nit tuned in specially for the teaching aspect of this somewhat a-typical section\nof the full programme ; they appear, rather, to have been quite ordinary house¬\nwives, undistinguished by any particular desire to improve their French—as\ndistinct from, say, an adult education class in French. In the second place, to\nhold this wide audience, the programme had to be a piece of genuine entertain¬\nment and this put an obvious limit upon the rigorousness of the teaching method\nwhich could be used. Thirdly, while there was no progressive fall in the size of\nthe audience seeing successive programmes in the series, there was relatively"
