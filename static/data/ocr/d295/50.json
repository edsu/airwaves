Harley\nPresident National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters\nDuP&nt Circle Office Building\n1346, Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nU.S.A.\nDear Bill,\nAs you know we have a regular contact with\nMr. Burrows in Ann Arbor,\nTo our dismay we learned that reception during\nthe last weeks was far from ideal. I spoke to our technical\ndepartment and the result you find enclosed in this letter.\nNow just to avoid any misunderstandings:\nWe are quite aware of the fact that we in the Netherlands\nhave no special knowledge in the technical radio field which\nis not available to your technicians. On the other hand there\nis always a possibility that there might be something in it\nwhich strikes a chord. In short: if you think it is useful\nto send this paper plus leaflet to all stations concerned,\nplease let me know and we will do it. If you think there is\nnothing new in it, do not hesitate to say so.\nI trust everything in Washington is all right.\nWe still remember the wonderful time we had here during your\nstay. Greetings from De Mulder Bonello, Van Eijndhoven and\nall the others.\n/Cordially,\nSDEELAND WERELDOMROEP\nJohn W. Acda\nDirector Central Programme Service\nEnclosures"
