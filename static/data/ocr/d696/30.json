Hill\nNational Association of\nEducational Broadcasters\nSuite 1119\nDupont Circle Office Building\n131*6 Connecticut Avenue, N. W.\nWashington 6, D. C.\nDear Harold:\nI would like to circulate among our Public Relations Committee the minutes\nof our meeting in Columbus. Try as I will, I cannot remember too much\ndefinitive action so I am sending you (with a copy to Betty) a tentative\nset of minutes which I would be glad if you and Betty would criticize,\namplify, and shoot it back to me. Then I will get out the definitive set\nof minutes for circulation to all of the committee members.\nIn all honesty, I am somewhat disappointed as to the caliber of the\npeople on this committee. I don't mean anything personal by this, but\nthe group in Columbus revealed almost a 100$ vacuum of public relations\nknow-how, though one member was certainly not remiss when it came to\ntalking up about the matter. One of our best potentials on this commit¬\ntee, namely, Marion Corwell, had to be absent because of a conflict. I\njust wish she had been there because I am sure we would have something\nmore constructive to emanate from our meeting. When I send out the\nactual minutes, I am going to ask Marion to let me have her ideas in\nconsiderable detail.\nIt was great to see you in Columbus and I am sorry we didn't get to gab\n’more frequently.\nBest wishes.\nRadio and Television Communications\nEGS:mm\ncc: B. McKenzie"
