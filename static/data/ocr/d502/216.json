H.\nGriffiths of our staff and from a letter dated December 13, v\n1954 from Dr. Harry J. Skornia to Mr. Griffiths, that this\nservice is proving somewhat more economical than had been\nanticipated. It appears therefore that the unexpended\nbalance of the grant will permit continuation of the\nservice to June 30, 1956.\nIt is my pleasure to inform you that the Fund has approved\nan extension in the term of the grant to June 30, 1956. In\nall other respects the provisions and terms of this grant\nwill be the same as those set forth in my letter of\nApril 16, 1954 to Mr. Ausmus.\nMr. Griffiths will continue to be in close touch with you.\nOur Board would like to receive a progress report on this\ngrant by May 1, 1955 la time for its meeting later that\nmonth. An audited financial statement at the end of your\nfiscal year would also be appreciated.\nWe trust that this grant is enabling the National Association\nof Educational Broadcasters to render important consultation\nservices to local educational television and radio stations.\nSincerely yours.\ncc: Dr. Harry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director, NAKB"
