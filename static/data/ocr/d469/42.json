This\nis not the place or time to comment at great length on the\nformation of a state radio agency (if your state doesn't have\none) - but it is obvious that such agencies will play aft\nincreasingly important role in the implementation of the\nBroadcasting Facilities Program. It is our hope, of course,\nthat in each state the officially designated agency will\ncombine responsibilities for both radio and TV - so that we\nat the Federal level will not have to referee contentions\nbetween state agencies as well as between applicants. We\ntrust that this point will come across str6ng, and that you\nwill fully understand the need for close coordination and\ncooperation with your state agency in developing your plans\nfor applications under this program,\nDEADLINES FOR SUBMITTING APPLICATIONS\nOne more area of comment - and then Iâ€™ll turn Stu Hallock loose. I\ncannot tell you when we can start to receive applications for radio\nprojects, except that it will be as soon as regulations and application\nforpjs are published and sent to you. But I can tell you that a deadline\nor \"cut-off\" date will be established for the submission of applications."
