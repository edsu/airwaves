And Please\nDon't Forget Radio\nBy JACK GOULD\nIN All the lofty and stimu¬\nlating concern over the\nfuture of non-commercial\ntelevision, there has been\nA persistent and ill-considered\ndisregard of an older and\nequally deserving medium:\nnon-commercial radio. Radio\nhas been a victim of discrim¬\nination that surely should\nbe corrected in any long-\nrange consideration of de¬\nveloping broadcasting’s cul¬\ntural resources.\nWhile millions of dollars\nare casually dispersed in the\ncause of educational TV, there\nhas not even been a thought\nabout some nickels and dimes\nfor the sound medium that\nhas so much to offer and can\ndo it at a tiny fraction of\nthe cost of improving the\nhome screen.\nThe sturdy champions of\nnon-commercial radio have\nreason to be discouraged.\nCongress passed the Educa¬\ntional Television Facilities\nAct to award Federal funds\nfor construction and improve¬\nment of ETV plants, but the\nmeasure made no mention of\nradio. The Carnegie Commis¬\nsion on Educational Televi¬\nsion, as its title implies, did\nnot even concern itself with\nthe problems of educational\nradio. It urged the establish¬\nment of a “Corporation for\nPublic Television,” apparent¬\nly without so much as a\nthought for the more ade¬\nquate alternative of a “Cor¬\nporation for Public Broad¬\ncasting.” The Ford Founda¬\ntion gave a bit of passing\nlip service to radio, but the\nfund basically is all wrapped\nup in the glamor of TV.\nPrecisely because such au¬\ngust bodies have fallen under\nthe hypnotic spell of video,\nit is not an exaggeration to\nsuggest that non-commercial\nradio could face a crisis more\nsevere than the multitudinous\nproblems confronting educa¬\ntional TV. Congress is sched¬\nuled to act again this year\non the Educational Facilities\nAct and, if radio is omitted\nonce more, the sound medium\nmight never get its foot in\nthe door again. Non-commer¬\ncial radio clearly belongs on\nthe agenda of the Senate\nCommerce Committee when\nhearings on non-commercial\nTV are held.\nE. G. Burrows, chairman of\nthe National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters,\nwho is manager of the radio\nstations at the University of\nMichigan, said last week that\nhis organization would press\nfor favorable Senate con¬\nsideration of the. needs of\neducational radio.\nThe contrast in the econo¬\nmics of educational tele¬\nvision and radio are little\nshort of startling. The Car¬\nnegie Commission, for in¬\nstance, suggested that $45,-\n000 might be the cost of one\nhour of qualitative educa¬\ntional TV. On a budget of\n$60,000 for a full year, Na¬\ntional Educational Radio, the\ntaped network of non-com¬\nmercial stations, turns out\n1,200 programs from its head¬\nquarters in Urbana, HI.\nMr. Burrows is not on# to\nindulge in guesses as to what\neducational radio might need.\nBut when it was noted that\nmost everyone thinks educa¬\ntional television ultimately\nwill need at least $200-mil-\nlion to do a respectable job,\nhe was asked what $l-million\nmight mean for educational\nTV. He was practically\nspeechless. “We could do so\nmuch I couldn’t spell it out,’*\nhe said.\nAt the' moment, there are\napproximately 350 licensed\nnon-commercial radio stations\nof all types. Some are\naffiliated with churches, such\nas WRVR in New York;\nothers are arms of city or\nstate school systems and a\ngreat many are providing an\noverall community service\nunder the auspices of major\nuniversities and colleges.\nCivilized Belief\nOperating on veritable\nshoestring budgets, many of\nthe stations have registered\nremarkable achievements in\npublic service, in alert cover¬\nage of controversial issues\nand in substituting imagi¬\nnation for lush production re¬\nsources. Especially in areas\nwhere the caliber of commer¬\ncial radio has not been\nnotably diversified, it has\nbeen the non-commercial sta¬\ntion which frequently has\nprovided an oasis of civilized\nrelief with a schedule of clas¬\nsical music, talks by univer¬\nsity faculty members and\nrcDortape of local affairs. Tf\ngrass roots broadcasting is\nconceded to be a laudable na¬\ntional goal, much of it is now\nactually going on without\nsalute or cheer.\nIt would be foolhardy to\nassume that only television is\ncapable of educational broad¬\ncasting. There are many types\nof programs where visual il¬\nlustration is not necessary\nand the exciting idea or the\nprovocative dissertation can\nbe distributed with great ef¬\nfectiveness by radio.\nThroughout the country\nsome of the non-commercial\nstations, most of which are\nin the FM band, are linked\ntogether either regularly or\noccasionally by a live state\nor regional network. But\nwhen it is thought how much\nmight be done with regular\nlive coast-to-coast network¬\ning in national and interna¬\ntional news—and for almost\npennies in comparison with\nTV’s overhead—the potential\nof the neglected medium of\nnon-commercial radio falls\ninto exciting perspective.\nNational Educational Radio\nat present is farther ahead\nin tapping the rewards of in¬\nternational broadcasting than\nany other American radio or\nTV service; it regularly ex¬\nchanges tapes with overseas\nbroadcasters. With suitable\nyet modest financial aid, it\nis within the realm of pos¬\nsibility for educational radio\nto span oceans and continents\nvia the satellites. Sampling\na night of Japanese radio or\nBritish radio as the news\nhappens is a new horizon for\nthe sound medium and could\novercome the erratic condi¬\ntions now suffered in short\nwave transmissions.\nAs chairman of the\nN. A. E. B., which embraces\nboth the television and radio\nbranches of educational\nbroadcasting, Mr. Burrows\nsees the two media as hav¬\ning a vital role to play in\nthe use of the airwaves for\naudience enlightenment and\nenjoyment. But he is dead\nright in stressing that the\nadvancement of educational\nTV should not entail any in¬\nadvertent stunting of the\ngrowth of non-commercial\nradio. It would indeed be\nshort-sighted to leave the\nsound medium out of the\nforthcoming deliberations in\nCongress or the overall dia¬\nlogue on educational broad¬\ncasting. Educational TV prob¬\nably is bound to get 90 cents\nout of every philanthropic or\ngovernmental dollar commit¬\nted to the cause of improved\nbroadcasting; but the 10 cents\nleft over could make a huge\ndifference for non-commercial\nradio."
