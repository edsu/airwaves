When properly prepared, it opens many doors\nto important classroom learning activities. By its very design, it enlists\nthe active and indispensable help of the classroom teacher.\nThe film and supporting materials which this kit contains have\nbeen designed to demonstrate that utilization is not an artificial \"someÂ¬\nthing\" \"tacked-on\" to the instructional lesson as an afterthought but a\ndynamic process which develops naturally from elements carefully and\nskillfully incorporated into the lesson structure.\nThe activities which precede, accompany, and follow the lesson\nitself are part of a blend of pupil experience and behavior which has\nlearning as its sole objective. A properly prepared television lesson\nrecognizes this fact.\nTelevision lessons are utilfzed most effectively when they have\nbeen developed for specific purposes in answer to existing classroom\nneeds. The success of the television lesson will depend upon how well\nit does the job which needs to be done . The success cannot be measured\nsimply by watching the lesson on screen, no matter how impressive the\npresentation may seem to be. The final proving ground is the classroom,\nand the ultimate criterion is what happens to the students.\nIn preparing the television lesson, those who participate in the\npreparation must achieve a balance between presentation and content.\nD-3"
