Indeed, it is not\ninconceivable that the expansion of educational television\nservice in the future might require or be substantially aided\nby the use of VHF boosters. Nevertheless, it is the interest\njJ\nof the public as a whole ^hich must ultimately determine the\nresult of this proceeding, and the NAEB is of the view that\nthe VHF booster is the least desirable of any of the proposed\nmethods for bringing television service to underserved areas.\nConsequently, it feels that if the Commission authorizes such\na service it should be severely restricted in scope in order\nto prevent degradation of television service generally. For\nthe reasons set forth above, the Commission should restrict\nVHF boosters to those situations where a clear showing can be\nmade that no other method can attain the desired objective.\nRespectfully submitted,\nTHE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF\nEDUCATIONAL BROADCASTERS\nBy___\nLeonard B.
