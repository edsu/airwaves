Skornia,\n14 Gregory Hall,\nURBANA, Illinois,\nU.S.A.\nDear Harry:\nTo-day arrived a note from Irv Merrill to re-assure\nme lest I had felt there were some antagonisms toward me\nin the committee. Actually, I enjoyed myself quite well\nand, as you know, my one concern is to get the utmost help\nfrom the committee and to provide the maximum in exciting\nmaterial and project to be tested.\nThe Chicago meeting assured me that I can work quite\nhappily with the committee, and can learn a great deal from\nthem.\nHaving to speak at the General Electric Management\nCentre right after the Chicago meeting, I hastened on to New\nYork to confer with Wells Foshay. We had several hours\ntogether and some of them were spent with Louis Forsdale\nalso being present.\n^ I explained the proposal of Sam Becker*s committee that\nI prepare a syllabus, at once, for experimental teaching\nin a variety of classes. (i asked at General Electric\nManagement Centre whether they would consent to try out the\nsyllabus among their executive training classes, and they\nsaid it was entirely agreeable to them. This would mean\nhaving an adult group of august dimensions indeed^\n^ Foshay saw no difficulties in this pattern and said that\nhe would be glad to provide a list of objectives in the course\nthat would be feasible for testing, since he understands my\napproach on my terms and is willing to translate it into\ntester terms. But he emphatically assured me that there was\nno need to use the syllabus for any such period as a full\nsemester in order to have what he called K.O.R. (Knowledge\nof Results). He insisted that one or two weeks, at most,\nwould give adequate K.O.R. He said it would mean teaching\nand testing single concepts of a medium or of the interaction\nof two or more media.^\ncontinued..."
