Skornia\nExecutive Director\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nlh Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Harry:\nFinally I am enclosing not a rough draft of the\nminutes of the Utilization Committee meeting as I said\nin my December 2nd letter, but the revised copy of the\nminutes • These have been checked by the committee mem¬\nbers and, to the best of our knowledge, is the correct\nrecord of the meeting.\nOn this business of using some Title VII funds to\ndevelop out Utilization Kits; the more I think of this\nthe more I feel it is a definite possibility* I still\nhave not heard from Jim McPherson, of the U.S. Office,\nconcerning the method of introducing your proposal\non Part B of Title VII.\nDEC 1 0 1953\n7\"&|9|10(11|12|1|2,3|4|5|9\nl\nIf you can take the time to discuss this with the\npeople there, perhaps something can be gotten underway\nsoon. I would like to work on this project and it-appears\nto me that the first stage will be to get around to some\nof the areas doing school programming to line up material\nfor the Utilization Kits• I have the time now and will\nnot get involved with our local problems until sometime\nin February.\nIf money could be made available so that I could\nspend some time during the month of January getting the\nproject started, then the rest of the year would be time\nenough to actually produce the kits. I’m sure I do not\nneed to point out to you that these have to be planned,\nand certainly parts of them produced,while children are\nstill in school.\nfl<-- “ft\n•sSfS"
