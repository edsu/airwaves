Illustrated.\n1,070 pp. New York: Appleton-\nCentury-Crofts. Two volumes, boxed.\n$12 the set.\nBy ADRIENNE KOCH\nTHE star of Thomas Jefferson\ncontinues to rise. Ameri¬\ncans, made conscious in this\ngeneration of the real and po¬\ntent danger of tyranny and\ntotalitarianism, turned in the\nThirties, with the logic of self-\ninterest, to the inspiration and\nworks of the finest democratic\nmind in this nation’s history.\nWhat began there in the way of\nfresh studies of Jefferson’s\nmind and his “lengthening\nshadow” of democratic influ¬\nence, was keyed to new maj¬\nesty with the preparation of the\nfull writings of Thomas Jeffer¬\nson.\n“The Papers of Thomas Jef¬\nferson,” four volumes of which\nhave already appeared, is con¬\nceived on the grand scale of\nfifty-two, volumfla.^t the-same\ntime.fDumas Malone^ compre-\nhensivfe^five-VQlunrrebiography\n(the second volume was pub¬\nlished in October) is breaking\nnew ground, departing from ac¬\ncepted myths and distortions\nabout its complex and ever-\nfascinating subject. It is hard¬\nly surprising, in this atmos¬\nphere of recrudescent demo¬\ncratic theory, that even those\nwho originally gave their hearts\nto Hamilton experience some\nhistoric impatience with the\nspecialized contribution of that\nimportant figure, and seek\nbroader vistas such as Jeffer¬\nson, the humanist, can provide..\nNathan Schachner, whose in¬\nterest in history is combined\nwith journalistic talents and\nstatesmen: “Alexander Hamil¬\nton” and “Aaron Burr.” Per¬\nhaps his Hamilton, once warmed\nby the author’s obvious admira¬\ntion, has been superseded in\nhis affections (since men do\nchange) by the man whom\nHamilton detested—a solid ha¬\ntred that was sincerely recip¬\nrocated by Jefferson.\nAnother approach to un¬\nderstanding Mr. Schachner’s\nprogram of work may be con¬\nnected with the tough problem\nof biographical writing. To\nmake the subject of a biography\nattractive, how far should an\nauthor go in coalescing his\nviewpoint sympathetically with\nthat of his protagonist in the\nnarrative ? It is difficult, on\nthe basis of these biographies of\ntwo arch enemies, to decide\nwhether Mr. Schachner, once a\nHamiltonian, is now a Jeffer¬\nsonian; or whether this last\nstudy represents his core of po¬\nlitical beliefs, while the earlier\none was a conscientious work of\nwriting a biography for which\nthere was market and need.\n\"One should not infer that the\nassumption behind these re¬\nmarks is that the modern Amer¬\nican democrat must limit him¬\nself either to Hamilton’s inspi¬\nration or to Jefferson’s—but not\nboth. On the contrary, we are\nall inheritors of the good works\nof both men. The question at\nissue is how, in the sharp and\nexplicit conflicts of Jefferson\nand Hamilton, the same author\ncan present both men as cham¬\npions, implicitly conceding that\neach one is right.\ntraining, has to his credit ^study or an independent ap-\n(among other works) two pre¬\nvious biographies of Am °rican\nPresident, and his busy retire¬\nment. Mr. Schachner borrows\nheavily from the impressive lit¬\nerature—both biographical and\nintellectual history — that al\nready exists on Jefferson, and\nhe brings, in addition, a respect¬\nable knowledge of valuable pri¬\nmary manuscript sources.\nSince these two handsome vol¬\numes are more comprehensive\nthan any previous biography in\nthe twentieth century (Ran¬\ndall’s larger “Life of Jefferson”\nbelonging, in more than the\nchronological sense, to the nine¬\nteenth century) they will surely\nearn themselves a considerable\nreading public. They will not,\nhowever, satisfy students of Jef¬\nferson with anything approach¬\ning the degree of intellectual\nsatisfaction that-H^umaF^lJar;\nlone’s “Jefferson ahdt His Tilfie^\nis creating. In Malone’s work\none finds a combination of the\nmost meticulous scholarship, the\nmost courteous acknowledgment\nof debt to those who have pro¬\nvided materials or interpreta¬\ntions of Jefferson, and the most\ngenuine maturity of judgment\nand interpretation—a combina¬\ntion that together with gracious\nprose promises to produce the\ndefinitive biography of Jeffer¬\nson for our century., . .\n| N any event, Mr. Schachner’s\naccount, while not an original\nMiss Koch is the author of\n“Jefferson and Madison: The\nGreat Collaboration.’*\npraisal, is a story clearly told.\nThe reader is invited to follow\nJefferson from his light-hearted\nyouth, through his% early matu¬\nrity as author of the-Declaration\nof Independence, to his reign as\nI NDEED, in our time when so\nmuch has been done on the sub¬\nject of this biography, it is a\nlegitimate expectation that the\nreader of a new study will en¬\ncounter not only a well-written\nchronological account of Jeffer¬\nson’s life but an illumination of\nthe areas of his personality\nand career that were hitherto\nmarshy, imperfectly known, or\ndownright obscure. This expec¬\ntation is not entirely appeased\nby Mr. Schachner’s study.\nTo give examples: We need\nbetter knowledge abr^ut the\nbookish and intellectual influ\n(Continued on Page 38)\n6"
