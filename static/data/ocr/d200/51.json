I don't know whether he is interested\nin so short an assignment as is open at this time.\nI have just received the report of the Airlie House\nSeminar. As yet l have not had a chance to read it. As soon as\nthe doctoral candidates and a masters candidate wraps up the\ndissertation and thesis respectively, I'll get a chance to go\nover the document. The report of the Conference came as a complete\nsurprise. I had not received one word about the Conference - any\nof its planning or anything about it during its developmental\nstages. I don't know where communications broke down. I should\nthink members of the Board would routinely receive information\nof this kind.\n7l?|9|Lp,U|;\nKAC:mt"
