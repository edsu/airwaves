All Americans tend to stereotype others out\nof ignorance and instinct. There's a pervasive pattern now in\nwhich many Negroes generalize excessively about the attitudes and\ncallousness of white Americans. Perhaps more intensely, there\nis an excessive tendency by white Americans to regard the Negro\nas a figure of either listless subservience or one of criminal vio¬\nlence.

This can be done\ndozens of different ways and through dozens of different channels:\nchurches, clubs, organizations, etc. This may all sound vague,\nbut the suggestion is instrinsically simple. What I'm talking about\nhere is a simple need for Negroes and whites to sit down once in\nawhile in informal situations and settings to talk, to eat together,\nto work together, to be together. The best application of such a\ngeneral suggestion must, of course, in specifics, be developed\nlocally.\n3.
