Programs were grouped according to\naudience preference (not dependent on the number of viewers) and audience size\n(not dependent on the preference of viewers). An attempt was also made to list\nspecific individual programs liked and disliked by the reviewers of the British\npress.\nFinally, the writer completed a special breakdown of first-run newsreel pro¬\ngrams (not repeats) on the BBC television service intended for both children and\nadults. Sixty-six stories in adult newsreels were covered, as were 14 stories m\nchildren’s newsreel programs. These were analyzed to see, in the writer’s judgment,\nwhat countries or geographical areas they were primarily concerned with. Some\ncomparison as to the relative time it took BBC television news to cover a given\nevent was made possible through use of news log breakdowns for August 12—25, 1953,\nfurnished by the Columbia Broadcasting System of the United States for its Doug\nEdwards program.\nA cknowledgment s\nSeveral persons devoted much time and effort to helping the writer with his\nstudy. Among them are professor Arthur M. Barnes of the State University of Iowa,\nProfessor Dallas W. Smythe of the University of Illinois, and Robert Silvey,\ndirector of Audience research for the British Broadcasting Corporation.\nPublication and distribution of this report as an NAEB Research Project Report\nwas approved by the NAEB Research Committee, Robert J. Coleman, Chairman."
