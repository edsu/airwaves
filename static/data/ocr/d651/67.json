Harley\nPage 2\nMay 31, 1962\nIn addition to the above I QUESTION the value of production of\nTHE KIND YOU DESCRIBE, EXPERIMENTAL OR NOT, THAT DOES NOT\nCARRY WITH IT THE ASSURANCE OF DUPLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, AND\nUSE.*'*\n! WOULD HOPE THAT IF THE EXPERIMENT IS CONDUCTED THAT BOTH\nKINDS OF UNDERTAKINGS YOU BRIEFLY DESCRIBE MIGHT CARRY A\nSET OF SPGCIFI CAT IONS WHICH WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL\nNAEB MEMBER PRODUCING ORGANIZATIONS, BOTH FILM AND TELEVISION.\nUnder this concept any interested members could then submit\nTHEIR QUALIFICATIONS, FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, ETC,, AND THE\nACTUAL PRODUCER BE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF THESE.\nWhat I have said in this letter I am sure sounds negative.\nPerhaps this is because I am not well briefed on the backÂ¬\nground WHICH HAS LED TO THE NAEB BOARDfS MOTION. I ASSURE\nYOU I AM WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN FAVOR OF ANY NAEB ACTION WHICH\nWILL STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF OUR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION\nPROFESSIONALLY. PERHAPS AN EXPERIMENT IS NECESSARY TO\nDETERMINE WHETHER TELEVISION PRODUCTION IS THE PROPER BUSINESS\nFOR NAEB. If so,ul deeply hope that every possible step is\nTAKEN TO INSURE THAT THIS KIND OF PROJECT WILL STRENGTHEN\nRATHER THAN WEAKEN THE ORGANIZATION. *\nGLA:gj"
