This requires the\nrewriting of regulations, rather than merely amending them. It also requires\nestablishment of policies, and determinations of eligible projects which\nare not precisely identical with those for educational TV.\nThe eligibility of radio, projects also introduces into policy and\nprocedural considerations questions relating to state agencies, priorities,\nand total dollars available nationally and under the state limitation.\n(b) There's no use crying over spilt milk - and I dislike rubbing salt in\nopen wounds; but it ijs necessary to face up to the fiscal facts of life\nfor 1969 and 1970.\nYou are aware, of course of the stymie which has existed through the\nabsence of an appropriation for fiscal 1968. I'm sure you are also aware\nthat the appropriation for fiscal 1969 is $4,000,000 - and that the backlog\nof applications already on hand amounts to $33,000,000 requested in Federal\nfunds (among 73 applications) before radio applicants can even be heard\nfrom. That hurts - especially in a program which in previous years has\nenjoyed full appropriation of the authorized funds.\nThe authorized amount for fiscal 1970 is $15,000,000 - it doesn't take\nan expert at The New Math to conclude that the maximum possible two-year\navailability for Broadcasting Facilities would be $19,000,000 - insufficient"
