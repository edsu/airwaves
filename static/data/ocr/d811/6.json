The challenge which\ncame out of this first seminar was essential^^ develop trained^educationally^\nsound professionalism at the management and staff level of these stations—\nreplacing the engineers, English and speech teachers and others who had\ninitially first been \"tapped\" by their institutions to operafce this \"toy*\nor \"public relations outlet*\" Many of tbs stations, up to this time, were\noperated by single departments of the institutions owning them* Their\nuse as an instrument for tapping all the resources of the mother institution\nwas only vaguely perceived* Many were essentially \"amateur show\" operations,\nbarely distinguishable^except for the absence of commercials, from commercial\nstations. Unless a broader purpose was visualised for them, such stations\ndid not deserve to survive*\nFollowing the 19U9 Seminar, a request was submitted to the W* K,\nKellogg Foundation for finds to establish a national educational tape\nnetwork and a national headquarters for the NASS, with a paid permanent\nstaff* It was with the granting of these requested funds that what had\npreviously been only a dream began to becoms reality*\nWithin four years of the first grant, the NAEB Radio Network was\nself-supporting* The NAEB Headquarters, made possible by this grant, gave\nthe NAEB the mechanism which made possible the business-like administration\nof other grant funds in the slew but steady climb of the association\ntowards status as a respected service organization in educational broad¬\ncasting and the still slower progress towards achievement of the related\nrole as the professional association of those responsible, as management\nand staff members, for the operation of educational radio and television\nfacilities throughout the nation*\nIt is obvious that, before a profession can be developed,\nprofessional personnel must be created to fill it* During the past ten\nyears, to this end, the NAEB has conducted soma 2k Seminars and workshops"
