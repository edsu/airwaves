  "text": "The benefits are twofold: first, urban organ¬\nizations are linking themselves to farm com¬\nmunities; and second, civic groups are learning\nthe importance of unified action. Private or¬\nganizations in Burma, Ceylon and Pakistan have\nbecome interested in adapting this pattern of a\nrural action program and this concept of co¬\nordinated civic activity to their local needs.\nC O OPER ATI ON with other civic groups in\nvarious countries has contributed to: a women’s\norganization spreading knowledge of domestic\nskills; a women’s association helping destitute\nrefugees help themselves; a training program\nfor community development workers; a film so¬\nciety to promote the use of films by community\norganizations; a council to increase public inter¬\nest in world affairs; an association of private\nbroadcasters to promote improved broadcasting\nstandards and public service programs; and the\nestablishment of community centers.\nIn THE United States the Foundation works\nincreasingly with other institutions and groups\ninterested in Asia. This cooperation stems from\nthe belief that Asian-American understanding is\na two-way affair in which the Foundation can\nbe a helpful intermediary. This role has led to\ndifferent types of activities, including the ob¬\ntaining of grants or technical advisers for Asian\norganizations and the providing to the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters of a\nseries of radio programs, made in Asia and fea¬\nturing Asian leaders, for its some sixty member\nradio stations."
