This\ncould be expected from the analysis of occupational backgrounds of groups members\ngiven above.\nMeeting places.\nWith few exceptions, groups met in private homes. The same group usually\nrotated around among the homes of its members, although some groups met always in the\nsame home. Exceptions to the home as a meeting place were two groups in schools,\ntwo in churches, and one in a clubhouse.\nAge le ve 1.\nData were not collected on the age level. Observation, however, indicated\nthat most groups appeared to range between thirty and fifty. There were exceptions\nto this and one group included three persons over seventy.\nSurprisingly, high school students enjoyed the broadcasts as much as adults.\nTeachers in several high schools gave class assignments based on the program and reÂ¬\nported good results. There were also several reports of high school and college-age\nstudents meeting voluntarily to listen to the broadcasts.\nObservations on the discussion.\nPeriodic visits were made to ten of the groups selected for more careful\nstudy. The observers of these groups were all people with extensive experience in\ngroup discussion. These observer teams met before the visitations for briefings\nand immediately afterward to compare findings, nmong their general conclusions\nwere theses\n1. Discussion appeared to be mere vital in the friendship-type group than\namong the others."
