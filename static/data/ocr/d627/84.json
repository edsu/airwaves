She suggested a kinescope of a short broadcast followed\nby a kinescope of post~broadcast activities so that both the stimulation and the\nutilization could bo shown in their entirety. She suggested that we might be\nduplicating the effort of the group that is planning for airborne television\nand suggested that we get in touch with the people who are planning these series\nand the utilization of the broadcasts.\nJAMES M, WARD\nJim wrote that they do not have any material available which would fit\ninto the type of kit we could uso, but felt that with the facilities they have\nthere they could and would be willing to undertake the production of a utilization\nkit. He had one additional suggestion to make to those listed in the Information\nSheet. That would be the collecting into packages the various publications\nrepresenting the variety of newsletters, journals, etc. from such organizations\n.as NAEB, NET, JCET, etc., This could be extended to include publications about\nvarious TV equipment from dealers and manufacturersâ€¢ Another important addition\nto this printed material would be a collection of reprints or outstanding\narticles on ETV.\nEARL WYNN\nEarl referred the original letter to John Young but as yet John had not\nsent a reply. However, a note did come from Donald Dc Tarbet, Associate Professor\nof the School of Education, University of North Carolina. Don told me of a\nbook he had just completed and was now in the process of being published called\nTelevision and Our Schoole. He thought we might like to consider this a part\nof our material kit."
