The same sort of materials might be offered\nby us for use on RAX. Although George Wilson will be returning\nto Ann Arbor, Leslie Bassett will be heading for Rome in Septem¬\nber* 2 am sure he would be Interested in assisting in such a\nproject* Furthermore, it so happens that Robert Jones, a WUOM\nstaff member, will be traveling in Europe this summer. He plans\nto be in Rome about the first week of July and I have asked him\nto pay a visit to the American Academy to explore this matter\nfurther.\nIn the meantime, I would be happy to have your comments\non the feasibility of such an exchange. If you do not plan to be\nin Rome in July, could you suggest someone at the Academy and at\nRAI with whom Mr. Jones might talk?\nCordially,\nE. G. Burrows\nEGB/et"
