  "text": "-7-\nA third area I would like to discuss, briefly, with you, is one that is\nsomewhat different from the first two. j\nFor some t5„me I have felt that one of the reasons we were not yet using\nthe communications media to their fullest potential was because we have not\nbeen adequately prepared to do so. Most of us in the communications field\nhave come into it from either another discipline, have been educated in only\na small portion of it, or have been limited to broad and incomplete overviews\nof it.\nThere is not, in this country or anywhere in the world, a single center that\noffers to the student, to the communications industry, to government, to education\nto the professions, to all the varied fields needing communications expertise,\nthe kinds of communications training, experiences and services most vitally\nneeded today. There are so many needs: international service; socio-political,\nincluding urban, applications; management and industry production, distribution,\nsales, training; federal government agencies; state and local governments;\nnongovernmental professional and citizen organizations; many specialized fields\nsuch as medicine, religion, law; and others.\nIf we are to make greatest use of the potential of the mass media, we have\nthem\ngot to give / the resources, respect and prestige of other fields, and provide\nthsoiwith personnel of the highest quality. -=\nJust as the future scientist can go to M.I.T, or Cal Tech, shouldn’t\nthe future communicator also have a high quality University to learn\nin, in a field that is at least as important to the future of the world\nas are the disciplines now learned at MIT and Cal Tech?\nAbout a year ago X first proposed the establishment of a\nCommunications University to provide the needed education and services.\nIn the past few months, particularly, the response and support have\nbeen highly encouraging."
