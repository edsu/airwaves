  "text": "However, we suspect that the final, application form will very closely\nresemble this draft ** and that any changes made in the finally approved\nversion will not be substantively different.\nThat being presumably so, wa have decided that the most profitable\nthing we can do in tha 90 minutes available to us is to furnish you with\nthis information copy and walk through it with you. Our reasoning for\nthis approach is this:\n1) The application form is based on the Act and the proposed\nregulations. Included within it are all of the information\njustifications and assurances which will be required by the Act\nand Regulations. It is the vehicle by means of which those\nrequirements may be satisfied in making an application for Federal\nfunds - and therefore is a useful guide to the regulations\nthemselves.\n2) The application form is the instrument which you use in applying\nfor a Federal grant for radio transmission facilities. Obviously,\nyou will need to become thoroughly familiar with tha. Regulations\nand the Instructional Manual and the Eligible Equipment List,\nwhen these are available. But in applying for a grant, you don't\nsubmit the regulations - or return the instructional manual --\nyou submit a completed application. Thus, having this copy of the\nm form available, even though it is a draft and not yet official,\nwill give you the opportunity to study it and become familiar\nwith procedures involved."
