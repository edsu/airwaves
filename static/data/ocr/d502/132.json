Stephen Linck\nSpecial Services Division\nVogue Wright Studios\n237 East Ontario Street\nChicago 11, Illinois\nDear Mr. Linck*\nThis is in reply to your letter of February lh describing your meeting\nwith Dr. John Taylor and Mr. Jim Robertson of WTTW in Chicago and some\nof the problems they are facing.\nI am very sorry I am unable to give you any useful information in con¬\nnection with the reports you are preparing for one of your classes at\nthe University of Chicago on MUnion Regulations and Educational TV-\nAFTRA.\"\nFrankly, I don*t know if any formal statement of policy has been ad¬\nvanced by AFTRA with respect to educational television stations, and\nI am curious as you are about the rumored understanding which is\nsupposed to be afloat.\nThe thing that does strike me is that, with the fiscal situation in\nwhich most of these educational television stations find themselves,\nif anything other than if the \"you do not make money no demands will\nbe imposed” arrangement was considered it might very well be the death\nof them all.\nIt is possible, and again I do not know definitely, that Dr. Harry J.\nSkomia, who is the Executive Director of the National Association of\nEducational Broadcasters and who may be addressed at lh Gregory Hall,\nUniversity of Illinois, might have some information on the subject\nwhich you are pursuing.\nI will be interested myself in what you might find out.\nSincerely yours.\nRichard B. Hull\nRadio-TV Director\nRBHsdm"
