Becker, Chairman\nNAEB Research Committee\nDivision of Television, Radio, Film\nUniversity of Iowa\nIowa City, Iowa\nDear Sam:\nI’m sorry I wonTt be able to make NAEB this time,\nI’m especially sorry since I seem to have represented you and the com¬\nmittee on a couple of occasions, I think you’ve been informed of the\noutcome of the trip to Washington to \"advise” on the need survey. This\nwas the usual case of getting research advice after the fat is in the\nfire.\nI enjoyed the work session here and took quite a lot of time from classes\nto take part. The outcome in this case is represented by the statement\non research contained in our draft statement, dince this largely repre¬\nsented viewpoints expressed by me, I hope it meets with the committee’s\napproval.\nRegards to you and the rest. Sorry to be a poop-out.\nYours,\nBHWsbfm\nBr^ice H. Westley\nAssociate Professor"
