(The form used\nfor evaluation reports is attached as Appendix 3*)\nA) There was unanimous agreement on the value of this type of seminar; on\nthe gratitude of those involved, both members and staff, to the W. K.\nKellogg Foundation; on the need for this type of continuing training\nfor staff writers at educational radio stations; on the advisability\nof having further such seminars in the future, with the modifications\nsuggested below.\nB) There was general realization that the Seminar had provided the follow¬\ning desirable outcomes:\n1) A sharing of experience between school writers, coming from widely\nscattered geographic backgrounds, with wide variations in experience\nand a surprisingly wide spread in working facilities, experience,\nand station policies.\n2) Opportunity for personal evaluation of work, through listening\nto similar programs by tape from other areas, although a longer\nseminar, with more listening sessions, would have made it possible\nfor each member to have had one program of his writing auditioned\nand evaluated by at least one staff member and part of the group.\n3) A chance to verbalize one!s own writing philosophy and to re-evaluate\npersonal goals in specific areas, such as social studies broadcasts.\nh) An exchange of ideas and opinions, through discussion during meetings\nand in extra-curricular situations."
