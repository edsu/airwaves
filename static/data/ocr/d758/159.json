  "text": "Mr. Harold Hill\n-2-\nSeptember 23, 1963\nZM!L 16 -- Foundations. Not useful. Of historical interest only.\nIf this list were limited to grants made during the year, and some\nindication of recipient and amount of grant, it might have more value.\nPage 18 — CCTV. Very valuable. It needs annotation however.\nNumber of students served during the year. Operating budget last\nyear--something to give a hint about dimension. Perhaps a series\nof symbols could be used: R-140, S-l, C-2, N-3, 500 might indicate\n140 receivers, 1 studio, 2 cameras, serving 3500 students, etc.\nType of application could also be shown.\nPage 24 -- Same for military installations.\n25 — AF TV stations -- good. Add information on Armed\nForces radio and television network with names and addresses.\nPage 26 -- Networks - good.\nPage 28 — ETV stations - good. Add date of establishment.\nPage 33 — Stations under construction - good.\nPage 34 -- Applicants - good.\nPage 35 -- Courses. Almost everyone gives an orientation course\nnow. I suggest this be limitdd to schools teaching lab courses in TV.\nPage 42 -- Research. Good. List new research reports which have\nappeared during the year. List research under way if possible. The\nannotations are very helpful.\nPage 64 — Colleges granting credit, etc. — of doubtful value.\nPage 73 -- Schools making regular use -- a hint as to how much use\nin terms of programs per week and what kind of use, in terms of in¬\nschool lessons, school public relations on commercial stations, etc.\nwould be necessary if this is to have value. Again, symbols would do it.\nBrief bibliography of significant articles appearing during the year would be\nuseful. An editorial committee might make the selection, thus letting you\noff the hook."
