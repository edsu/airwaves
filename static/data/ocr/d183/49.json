This bodes well for the networks future*\nTOWARD A SOLUTION OF SOME PROBLEMS\nTwo important steps were taken during the past year to\nhelp solve some of the network's most pressing problems*\nIn January there met in Urbana a group of engineers and\ninvited electronics specialists. This group was concerned with the\ntechnical problems of tape recording and the mass reproduction of\ntapes* Tape recording is such a new process that the extant techni¬\ncal standards are incomplete. Thus it became obvious that techni¬\ncal standards would have to be devised fcy our own members* A pre¬\nliminary report was submitted. The standards are now being revised\nand will soon be published as a technical guide for the entire net¬\nwork operation.\nIn February there met in Lafayette, Indiana, the Tape\nNetwork Program Acceptance Committee and the In-School Programs\nCommittee. These committees were confronted with the problem of\nestablishing policies and evaluative criteria for programming the\nnetwork. A greatly increased mutuality of thinking on the subject\nof programs resulted. A report of these findings was published\nfor the information of all member stations. The In-School Programs"
