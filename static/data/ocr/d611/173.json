This study is well under way, analyzing instructional television and radio,\n!\nincluding broadcast, closed-circuit, CATV, ITFS, and two-way communications of\ndata! links and computers, and their relationship to each other and to instruc¬\ntional materials such as videotapes, films, discs, computers and other devices.\nIf the study results, as many people expect, in recommendations to Congress for\nlegislation and for an instructional communications act similar to the Public\nBroadcasting Act; if such legislation-~and sufficient appropriations-«are\npassed; and if these media, properly funded, are then used as the realistically «\nprincipal bases of communications in education--and not, as now used, as\nreinforcement of 19th century methods and techniques~~then v,Te may be on our way\nto one significant remedy for the urban crisis.\n/mother approach is evidenced in the recently released statement on national\npolicy by the research and policy committee of the Committee on Economic\nDevelopment. In a study entitled \"Innovation in Education:’ New Directions for\nthe American School,\" the CED recommends reorganization of the American school\nfor innovation and change, increased emphasis on research, dissemination and\napplication, use of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis in the schools\nand-~perhaps most immediately pertinent to our discussion here-~the establishment\nby Congress, as an independent, non-governmental agency, a Commission on Research,\nInnovation and Evaluation in Education. Such a Commission might very well\nprovide the impetus and even persuasion to change our educational system for\neffective use of communications--again permitting application of an important\nremedy to urban crisis."
