This amount would include $2$000 overhead designed to\ntake care of NAEBfs expenses and administrative costs.\nThe letter contains the following paragraph:\nt?The Board of Directors made one suggestion with which our staff\nconcurs. They felt that there should be some design*, plan or\npossibly theme operating in the assignment of these grants\nand directing in‘some measure the general nature of the content\nfor which such support will be given. It is necessary, there¬\nfore, for me to suggest that in connection with planning for\nthe grants this year procedures be developed to insure that\nsome°such pattern is made available. This, the Board felt,\nv/ould tend to place some limitations upon the nature of the\nprogram content for which the Center would make grants on\nthe recommendation of the NAEB and thus concentrate a little\nmore about some significant program needs in the offering,.\nWhile the Center has no desire to dictate the nature of this\npatterns we do wish to encourage its development,”\n1 recommend approval."
