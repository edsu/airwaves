Frankly, I still am after reading\nMorris® letter. I*m not obstinate (1 hope I'm not in\nthis case); I Just want to be sure. I believe I could\nbe convinced a lot faster in Tom's favor than I could\non lots of others. I write to assure you I am In\nsympathy with your general attitude regarding such\ncases. I believe my records of the years would orove\nme as one who practices such theory.\nRegards,\nFESsfrah\nFrank B. Schooley\nTreasurer"
