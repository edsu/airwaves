I am glad\nthat the decks have been cleared and that the\npeople are at work on the transmitter installation.\nThe sooner you are able to go on the air, the better.\nI hope the community is aware of the week to week\nprogress you are making. I canÂ»t help but feel the\nnext six months will be crucial. The pressure for\nFGG will be great. The high rate of the few stations\nthat have changed hands will make a lot of guys put\nup a fight for the few remaining channels, and the\nreserve educational frequencies are the easiest\ntarget.\nSo, lots of luck to you and it was good to have\nbeen of sane help.\nMSN/bmr\nMr. Richard J. Goggin\nGeneral Manager\nStation KETC\nSt. Louis 5, Missouri\ncc: Mr. G. Ausman\nMr. H.Skomia"
