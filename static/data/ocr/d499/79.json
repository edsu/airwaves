I realise that your members would\nneed to be consulted and that this may mean waiting for an annual meeting but\nI wondered whether there is any further information you may need about the ABU.\nIf there is, I hope you will not hesitate to let me know.\nWe have been working hard on the preparation for our second General Assembly in\nTokyo next month but the very distressing conflict between India and Pakistan\nhas cast a heavy gloom over our preparations. All India Radio and Radio Pakistan\nare two of our major members and, as you will know, one of our Vice-Presidents\ncomes from India. There is nothing for us to do but hope for the best and proceed\nwith the job in hand to the best of our ability. This we are doing I\nWith kind regards,\nYours sincerely\nCHARLES MOSES\nSecretary-General\nMr. W.G. Harley,\nPresident,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\n134^ ^onnec‘^icu'fc Avenue,\nWASHINGTON 36, D.C.,\nU.S.A."
