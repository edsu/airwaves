G. Selvig\nof the ninth Minnesota district, formerly head of the Crookston experimental station^\n\"Outlining the situtation and asking for the readjustment in the name of education\nin a letter to General Charles McK. Saltzman, chairman of the federal radio commission\nRepresentative Selvig says: ’Dear General Saltzman* A short time ago I received a\nletter from the comptroller of the University of Minnesota, in regard to the radio\nbroadcasting situation at the university. He asked me to take this matter up with\nyou in case I felt that the petition of the University of Minnesota, at Minneapolis,\nCarleton college and St. Olaf college of Northfield, Minn., was just and should be\ngranted.\n\">As you are no doubt aware, the University of Minnesota station, WLB, shares the\nbroadcasting channel with Carleton college and St. Olaf college. With these three\neducational stations is joined a commercial station in Minneapolis with the call\nletters WRHM.\n\"’The three educational stations have always been able to agree as to the apportion¬\nment of time. They are now broadcasting about 20 hours a week while ViRHM broadcasts\n104. You will understand that a commercial station that has sold its time will broad¬\ncast anything’to fill that time. The educational institutions, if they have nothing\nworthy to say, keep silent at their hour. For years they have suffered constant en¬\ncroachment from this commercial station and are now pinned down so that they hove no\nelbow room for the development of their trulv educational program.\n\"’Therefore the three educational stations have united in petitioning the federal\nradio commission to assign to them the full time of this channel, which means that\nthey will have to occupy 72 hours a week. They are agreed to do this provided the\nstation WRHM may be put off this channel and onto another channel. WRHM accuses\nWLB of not making full use of its time. This is obviously impossible under the pres¬\nent conditions because when anything worth while comes up to broadcast it is found\nthat there is not time in which to do it, as WRHM has already sold that time to an\nadvertiser. The University of Minnesota, St. Olaf and Carleton college officials\nbelieve that they can fill the full 72 hours, provided the radio commission will grant\neducation its rights on the air.’\",\nFROM DR.
