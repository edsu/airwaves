He\nwas assigned to the 10-inch mill, where he wrestled 450-pound coils\nof white-hot metal with a pair of tongs. At first he went back to\nhis room at the YMCA after work so exhausted that he seldom had the\nstrength to eat dinner before flopping into bed. The Burns physique\nwas equal to the challenge, however, and he stayed on the job for\na year. It is a tribute to his instinct for personal relations that\nnone of his fellow mill hands ever knew he was a Doctor of Science.\nRepublic's management, however, soon became aware of Mr.\nBurns' special talents. Prom the 10-inch mill he rose through the\nranks to become director of metallurgical laboratories, superintendent\nof large ingot manufacture, manager of the Grand Crossing Works, and\nsuperintendent of Republic’s wire division.\nAt this point a new opportunity presented itself, in the\nform of an offer from Booz, Allen and Hamilton. He left Republic\nand at the age of 33 moved from the day-to-day decisions of line\nmanagement to the more rarefied atmosphere of corporate management\nconsulting. As a BA&H partner he worked during the next years on\nstudies and reorganization programs for thirty of the largest manu¬\nfacturing and mercantile corporations in the United States. The\ncompany also helped streamline many of the executive departments of\nthe Federal Government, as well as a number of foreign governments."
