It is just\npossible that even if we had them today, we could not profitably discuss\nthem - because they are written in Federalesc, and it will take you a\nlittle time to learn to read that dialect c£ the English language.\nWo have, however, put together for you a package of materials which\ncontain just about as much as can be said about the program prior to the\nissuance of officially approved regulations. Those materials were\ndistributed to you as you entered the hall (if you haven’t received one,\nraise your hand and one of our staff people will deliver a package to\nyou.)\nAmong those materials in a sample and unofficial copy of the 6th draft\nof the proposed application form. You will note that every page is labelled\n“working draft only - not for official distribution or use.” That is\nliterally true. These copies have been provided for your information only,\nand may not be used in any official manner."
