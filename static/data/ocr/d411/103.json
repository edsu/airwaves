The reader has no way of knowing which dif¬\nferences might he attributable to chance.\nThis study has some interesting implications for educa¬\ntional institutions with FM stations or wired-wireless stations.\nX would certainly urge that you whip it into shape and send\nit off to the NAEB Journal editor.
