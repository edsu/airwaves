We overlook\nthe need to explain the basic facts and possibilities to others.\n(Schenkkan)\nAKSWERs Workshops for teachers were arranged at KMOX before we got the\nschool radio station. Leaders in educational radio were brought\nin and sample programs were assembled. The Board of Education\nand administrators were invited. More than 500 teachers attended\nthese workshops and gained an understanding of what they could\ndo with an educational radio station. (Fleming)\nCOMMENT: Remember that talking to educators about something they know\nchiefly as entertainment is like trying to sell people on the\npractical uses of electricity when the only known use is the\nelectric chair. Put yourself in the place of those you hope\nto sell and consider what they know and don*t know. (Steetle)\nQUESTION: What might you do at Abilene, Texas, to develop interest in ETV?\nANSWER: The three colleges in Abilene are private religious schools\nwith modest incomes. Cooperation will not be easy. (Ross)\nCOMMENT: Get some powerful people to run interference. The backing of\nkey people and leaders is needed. (Lambert)\nCOMMENT: People will ask what you will do with ETV. The usual choices\nare (l) teach courses or (2) perform community service through\nadult education. If you. say teach by TV, you face the misunderÂ¬\nstanding of the educators. If you say adult education, you can\ncite no proof that you can do this. (Arms)\nQUESTION: How do you convince the educators?"
