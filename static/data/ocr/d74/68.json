In other words, whatever the results\nshowed, these would be the ones reported,\n7o I estimate this would take $30,000 to set up such an office\nfor one year, for personnel, travel funds and incidental expenses.\nI know there is enough interest in this kind of thing on the part\nof the commercial stations so that I would have no trouble in raising\nthe $30,000 in advance to get such a thing on the road; I am also confi¬\ndent that this kind of a service, under such an educational mantle would\nfind many eager patrons. I have checked this idea with our legal counsel\nand he does not feel that it is inconsistent with our non-commercial\nstatus.\nIf we really believe what we say in our constitution that \"our pur¬\npose is to promote the dissemination of knowledge, information, educa¬\ntion to the end of the educational and cultural and practical benefits\nof broadcasting may be extended to all\", then assisting in meeting the\nneeds of the public through broadcasting, whether via commercial or non¬\ncommercial facilities, would seem to be an appropriate concern of the\nNAEB."
