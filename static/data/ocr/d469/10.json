CONSULTANTS MEETING, DECEMBER 12 AMD 13, 1968\nEDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING FACILITIES PROGRAM\nRECOIS-IENDATIONS\nWith respect to implementation of Title I, P*L, 90-129 during FY 1969,\nthe following positions on policy appeared to have general concurrence:\nI. Fiscal policy for 1969\nA.\nB.\nIt appeared to be the sense of the panel that fiscal \"goals\"\nfor the $4,000,000 available in 1969 would be desirable, expressed\nin terms of a distribution of funds among various types of\nsupportable projects.\nAfter discussion of several formulae, the majority appeared to\nfavor a target proportionment as follows:\n1. Up to 10% ($400,000)\n- to be initially \"reserved\" (but\nnot guaranteed) for support of\nradio projects, pending evaluation\nof radio applications to be received.\n2. Of the remainder ($3,600,000)\na. 65% ($2,340,000)\nb. 35% ($1,260,000)\n- to be initially reserved for\nactivation of new stations.\n- to be initially reserved for\nexpansion or improvement of\nexisting' stations.\nII. Educational Television projects\nA. Consistent with purposes of the Act, and assuming feasibility\nwithin the state limitation of $340,000 per state in 1969,\nactivation of new ETV stations should continue to have the\nhighest priority for approval.\n1. To the extent consistent with actual applications submitted,\nemphasis in approvals should be placed on states having no\nETV stations or having less than 25% of population covered\nby ETV signal.\n2. The activation of second channels in areas already served\nby an ETV station should have relatively low priority.\nw*-—\n********—-———W-- m*—- wm———— ~.. - ~ ■"
