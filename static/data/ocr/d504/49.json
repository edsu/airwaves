OA. 4248\nRADIO : THE PLACE OF DRAMA IN THE OVERALL PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK\nAs mentioned at item 7 of the Report of the meeting of Drama\nExperts, this Appendix contains a summary of information contributed\nduring the course of the meeting by the various delegations present on\nthe place which radio drama occupies within the programme schedules of\ntheir organizations.\nBELGIUM\nSince last summer, the RTB has been decentralizing its proÂ¬\nduction centres without any increase in the overall air time.\nMagazine programmes are on the increase particularly on the Third Channel\nwhere Drama is having to give way to them.

Within this framework,\nBRT is experimenting over the broadcast in their original language of\nplays coming from other countries. Additionally, Channel II broadcast\nlighter and more popular plays and serials.\nCANADA\nSRC's output has hitherto been limited by the fact that only\none channel has been available but this will alter next autumn when a\nsecond channel comes on the air.
