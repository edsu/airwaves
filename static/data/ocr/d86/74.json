We foresee the need for a great many more educational teleÂ¬\nvision channels in California than are now assigned, I would\nurge the addition of as many channels as engineering standards\nwill permit, feeling certain that demands will come from every\nquarter of public education to activate these channels in the\nvery near future.\nSincerely,"
