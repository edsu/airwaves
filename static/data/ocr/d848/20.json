What is done after the reading of the textbook\nmaterial is determined by the needs and interests of this particular class and its indiviÂ¬\ndual members. Basically, the same procedure applies to the television lesson, and\ngenerally speaking, says the Narrator, no television lesson should be used without\nsome form of follow-through., .just as it should not be used without some form of introduction.\nNow, what could you do, he asks the viewers, to follow-through on the condepts\npresented in the television lesson? You have all sorts of methods at your command,\nhe tells them.. .methods you have used frequently.. .some immediate.. .some long-term.\nFor pupils with an evident problem, you may want to try more reading..,in the\ntextbook or other references.\nHe may use hand-props to demonstrate these things, or he may want to use art to\nshow these activities taking place.\nPerhaps you have or know of some good films to clarify or extend certain points\nin the television lesson."
