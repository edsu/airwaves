  "text": "searched and carefully planned, the series was\nshot in a frenzy,” Harney recalls. “The dancers\nwere flown from New York to Boston on week¬\nends. Our production staff worked seven days a\nweek for nine weeks. We had what commercial\ntelevision would consider practically no rehearsal\ntime and an undermanned technical staff.” Yet,\nin the words of a typical review, ‘ ‘ There is about\nthe whole affair an atmosphere of ingenuity and\nimagination, of faultless taste and dry wit.”\n“Sure, there are handicaps in ETV,” says Har¬\nney. “You can never call the ‘talent’ your own,\nwhether it’s a professor or a ballerina. A director\ndoes four or five shows a week; in commercial tele¬\nvision he’d be doing two at most. But the handi¬\ncaps are compensated for by freedom from inhibi¬\ntions and by the air of experiment. ’ ’\nThis kind of ETV versatility is illustrated in\nmusic alone at WGBH not only by “A Time to\nDance,” but in offerings like the weekly series on\njazz, conducted by Father Norman J. O’Connor\nof Boston University, and the famous telecasts of\nthe Boston Symphony Orchestra. The latter, now\nin their sixth consecutive year, are masterpieces\nof the union of a new medium with a traditional\nart form. There are no television rehearsals with\nthe orchestra, but Harney’s colleagues, producer\nJordan Whitelaw and director David Davis, spend\nhours reading the score and listening to record¬\nings so that, as Harney puts it, “when the sym¬\nphony is telecast, Jordan and Dave play the cam¬\neras as the orchestra plays the instruments.”"
