These could only be from NAEB members\nthough. Think here’s one where ETRC needs to go thru* us because of our\nAssociation status, and membership in Prix Italia.\nFor non-ETRC ones, of course, we can and should proceed anyway—but\nthese will be rare, I’d guess. Present Radio entry limits are 25-85\nminutes. Have checked the files in order to react intelligently to pro¬\ngram length (page 4). I’d think our suggestions might be from 15 to 60\n(or maybe 90) minutes. We'd generally profit from having the ceiling\nlower—in competition with longer Network etc. one - shot documentaries\nwhich we could less often match.\nI'd hope you could get Uewbum concurrence orally on this, first, rather\nthan trying to write it all up. A follow-up letter of confirmation would\nthen, if necessary, be possible.\nI think we can meet all the requirements (i.e. submitting members can).\nTranslations are less a problem for TV.\nH. J.
