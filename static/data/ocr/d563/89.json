Finding other\nprops was little trouble, since suddenly-rich min¬\ning millionaires had vast appetites for gaudy fur¬\nniture and Denver is replete with antique shops.\nAlthough Morath is the focus, about twenty\nKRMA staff members have worked on the series.\nIts combination of painstaking details and essen¬\ntial simplicity reflects the direction of James W.\nCase,the station’s indefatigable program director.\nA thirty-two-year-old veteran of commercial tele¬\nvision, Case, who has directed such ETV network\nseries as “Redman’s America” and the soon-to-\nbe-released “Our Neighbor: The Moon,” insists\nthat rigid professional standards guide KRMA’s\nprogramming. He impresses the educational\nstamp of the station even on the fifteen-second\nstation-identification breaks between programs,\neach of which is a production in miniature. The\nstation’s letters are superimposed over reproduc¬\ntions of works of art, ranging from a Rembrandt\nor Picasso painting to a Frank Lloyd Wright\nbuilding. Classical music accompanies the break.\nKRMA’s sign-off at the end of the day may be a\nWalt Whitman poem or a folk song played against\na series of paintings, woodcuts, prints, and photo¬\ngraphs."
