C.\n22 March 19 61\nDr. Samuel L. Becker, Director\nDivision of Television, Radio, Film\nTelevision Center\n609 10th Avenue\nIowa City, Iowa.\nDear Sam:\nWe are setting up plans for the 1961 NAEB convention which will be held\nhere in Washington.\nFollowing the suggestion made by you and others we want to devote one\ngeneral session to the presentation of top-notch papers on important\nsubject, presented by men who are authorities in their fields and who\nwill command the respect of the audience.\nI would guess that we will want to have, say, four such papers presented,\nand we would like your ideas for specific subject matter to be covered\nand suggested persons to prepare and present such papers. I know that\nyour basic interest might be in the research field, and we will undoubtedly\nwant at least one paper from that area. However, you will probably be\nable to come up with other topics and authorities, too, and it is for that\nreason that I am writing to you.\nThe persons we get should very likely be outside our own ranks, don't you\nsuppose? I am also asking Vernon Bronson, as chairman of our NAEB\nProfessional Development Committee, for suggestions as to topics and speakers.\nSince arrangements for such things take quite a bit of time, I would appreciate\nyour writing me as soon as convenient. If there are some of the persons you\nhave in mind whom you know well enough to contact for us, please so indicate\nso that we will have that information should we decide on one of those persons .\nThanks a lot, and it was good to see you, even briefly, when you were in our\nHEH:jph\nHarold E . Hill >\nAdministrative Vice President"
