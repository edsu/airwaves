We must then go on to assume that if this role\nis to be played in Amerioa certain services will be needed (without regard to\nwho performs each) * * * ®We then should base our proposal on a picture in which we\npropose certain financing, and a recommended administrative setup®\nI* Assumptions:\nAmong the assumptions we must make is that the NAEB has a long-range future,\nthat it has a broad fiscal base which rests on the services it can provide its\nrrembsr stations partly defray able through service charges® It therefore has a\ntax base which emphasizes the need for both television and radio to be built into\nthe budget of regular educational stations® At this point Dick Hull quoted Harold\nLasswelX3s statement that in the twentieth century there is no still small voice\nwithout the resonance of twentieth century mass communicationso\nAnother assumption that must be made is that radio is here to stay for the\nforseeable future® In this assumption we must also visualize funds needed for\nat least five years, indicating what we think will be the status of ET?, educa¬\ntional radio, and the various projects at the end of these five years® This will\nbe covered in greater detail under financial and administrative structure below®\nIIo Jobs To Do:\nAmong the jobs which must be dona and functions performed are notably the\nfollowing:\n1) Ways of meeting the fiscal crisis, both for education as well as the com¬\nmunications media, need discovering® In this respect the analogy of\nGerman community stations which are as independent as community ET? sta¬\ntions in the U® S® are to be® Hoever the German stations have a regular\nbase of fiscal support in the form of the taxes paid by each set owner\nwhich gives them an adequate and regular budget®\n2) Another job to be done involves the exchange of ideas, exchange of mate¬\nrials, and doing whatever is necessary to be sure that better programs are\nsecured® We need a center to distribute programs, as well as sources of\nprograms for both television and radio® We need reports for ET? and radio\nbefore Congress, and throughout the nation, as well as abroad®"
