Schooley\nStation WILL\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Frank:\nUpon my return to the office yesterday after a week at the Land Grant\nCollege meeting in Washington, I found your several reports dated\nNovember 17. I hasten to answer.\nFirst off, I am voting «yesw on both matters relative to the treasurer.\nI have one slight question however; shouldn*t the bank account be set\nup so that some other officer could sign a check in the absence or in¬\ncapacity of the treasurer? I recall we did this several years ago when\nthe late W. I. Griffith was treasurer, and it would seem a reasonable\nsafeguard. After all, we live in a dangerous age, what with motor cars,\nairplanes and what have you, and it might be good to have the president or\nsomeone authorized to sign checks against these funds if necessary. This\nmay be something which is already taken care of, but I mention it for what¬\never it is worth.\nRelative to the inquiry on committees, I fear I am the one director who\ndidn*t respond (see paragraph 2 of your report number 3), but this was\nbecause I had previously written you about this, and not because I didn*t\ngive the matter a thought. Actually I approved your suggestions, for which\nreason I didn*t comment on them further.\nI shall bring myself up to date on the subscription television problem in\nthe next few days and offer a comment as to whether or not I believe NAEB\nshould take a position on it.\nIt is good to see that you are getting in to matters so well. I hope to\nbe of every assistance possible.\nWith best personal regards.\nBurton Paulu\nManager of KUOM\nBPsdg\nhnc."
