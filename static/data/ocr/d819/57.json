Y.\nJanuary 23, 1952\nMr. James Miles\nGregory Hall\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Jim:\nYou will recall that at the meeting last weekend\nauthorization was provided for the expenditure of NALB funds\nto subscribe for Television Digest so that I would be able to\nuse it as a source of information in editing the News-Letter,\nwould you be so kind as to put through a requisition for it,\nrequesting that it be addressed to me here at KUOM.\nI received in the mail today notice of the January edition\nof their TV Factbook, which I presume would be distributed to\nregular subscribers. I wonuer if in placing the order you would\nrequest the subscription to include this.\nIt also happens that my HA&B subscription to Variety and\nBillboard have run out. I must say that 1 have not found\nBillboard helpful enough to justify its purchase from our funds,\nbut I would like very much to have Variety continued. If you\ncan properly do so would you requisition a Variety subscription\nfor me too?\nYour telegram Ccrae this morning relative to the meeting in\nLafayette on February 7, 3 and 9. You can count on me to be\nthere. I assume Lawson was included in this and accordingly\nhave checked with him; he will be able to make it too.\nYours sincerely.\nBurton psulu\nSecretary and Publications editor\nBp/arp\nCopy to Seymour Siegel\nFrank Schooley\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
