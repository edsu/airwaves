Becker\nJ4.6U Riverside Drive\nApartment 6l\nNew York 27, New York\nDear Sam,\nSorry to take so long getting back to you, but it’s\nbeen for good reason I think. Ifve passed your\nsuggested research plan to a number of our staff\nmembers and can now come back to you with a group\nreaction rather than mine alone* I*m also enclosing\na number of very recent commercial study results in\nwhich I think you* 11 be interested*\nRegarding your co-incidental study proposal, the\nreaction here was very favorable. The specific\nreactions have been obtained from James Robertson,\nDonley Feddersen, and myself. We agree that you\nhave outlined very clearly a sensible and very-\nworkable research plan. Answering your specific\nquestions, (a) yes, we believe most anyone could\ncarry out this study using this paper as its sole\nguide; (b) we can think of nothing to add to improve\nIt; and (c) we agree that this paper and others like\nit should definitely be made available to educational\nbroadcasting stations.\nWe would all like to commend your rationale for this\nkind of study in paragraph two of your paper. We\nhope that it will be understood properly and used\nwisely. Regarding our own WTTW use of a telephone\nco-incidental study, however, we all agree here that\nwe will probably not get into this in the forseeable\nfuture. The reason is that we can now beg, borrow,\nor steal identical information, or at least similar\ninformation from the commercial study people, as you\nknow.\nI»m enclosing to you some rather interesting infor¬\nmation which we have just begged, borrowed, and stolen\nfrom the commercial study people. Herein you will find"
