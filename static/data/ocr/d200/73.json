This will\npermit the separate Beards (Radio and TV) to meet from 9:00 a.a. to 11:00 a.m., if\nthey so desire. (We had earlier a request far information re the possibility of a TV\nBoard meeting - when we thought our Beard would meet on Tuesday - and had suggested\nTuesday morning, because we thought the full Board would meet starting at 2:00 in the\nafternoon on Tuesday. Kris was based on the premise that the USRT sessions, would start\nWednesday at noon, with luncheons, as they have in the past.)\nWe will begin to put together the Board agenda within e few weeks. Therefore, -we would\nappreciate it if you would send any suggested agenda items to me not later than April\n1, together with any background information you feel should be included in the prepared\nmaterial.\nMeetings of the Radio and TV Board will, of course, be called by the ebairaaea of same,\nif they desire, and they will prepare any inform! agendas to be used. Therefore, if\nyou have suggestions for items to be considered by the separate Boards, perhaps you\ncould send them to either Hurlbert or Khger.\nTo recap:\nTV and Radio Board (separate meetings) if desired - 9:00 ~ 11:00 a.m., Wednesday\nMay 2.\nFull Board - 11:30 a*®.- 4:30 p.m., Wednesday, toy 2-\nHEH/mlm"
