Does he fear that we511 compete? Were they\nfriendly agreements? Was he pressured into building them? Did\nhe simply build them as experiments, as test models?\n2© If we suddenly came up with 11 good heads someihere, wuld he then\nbuild for us? This is about what happened with the Canada deal©\nHe said that he was impressed when the fellow showed up with\na dosen Presto heads©\n3o Would Toogood weaken if he felt we were going to get someone\nelse to build the duplicator for us?\nko Would it expedite matters if he were offered a retainer fee\nfor the year following the installation of the duplicator to\nreln^mrse him for any attention he has to giv© the machine©\nSo Would it ease his mind if the machine were rented from him\nrather than purchased? Therefore he could reclaim the machine\nif it were used in competition with him-?\n6© Is it possible that since we are a very good customer of 3M\nand sine© Toogood depends upon 3M a great deal that some pres-\nsure could be brought to bear on Toogood by 3M?\nFrankly I have not made any headway with Toogood in the last six months©\nI believe some decision should be mad© at this time as to which course\nto follow,,\nRobert H© Johnston\nRecording Engineer"
