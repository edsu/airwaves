Any representative would be better than none if the\ndirectors couldn’t come.\nSkornia: We have to work through channels and the director or delegated -TAE3\nrepresentative is the one, naturally, whom we contact. We must observe organisa¬\ntional protocol. In many places this was too rough a weekend even for those to whom\nthe invitation was passed on to come. The men on the committee really worked\nhard at it, and failure of several members to be represented is not their fault.\nShoehalter: Perhaps it should be designated in the initial announcement that\nin case you can’t come, send a representative.\nWheatlev: I would like to move a special commendation on the speech of Mr.\nNovik on the History of the NAEB* and to support his suggestion that there be an\neffort by Headquarters to actively gather the material from the founders of NAEB\nand make it an official record in history. (Calls attention to the Harold Hill\nhistory and to previous efforts already in this regard.)\nSkornia; Is there any further discussion on this? (Motion carried unanimously)\nMartin: Has the same kind of resolution been passed for the hosts of the\nmeeting?\nSkornia: I shall now be very happy to entertain such a resolution.\nMartin: I move that the delegates of this meeting unanimously extend a vote\nof thanks to the hosts of this meeting, specifically Tony Zaitz, ‘’Wooster” Smith,\nand Harry Lyle. (Motion carried unanimously)\nShoehalter: Is it true that members of our profession in commercial broad¬\ncasting may become NAEB members?\n* Unfortunately not available, since it was made ad lib from notes."
