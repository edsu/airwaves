Miner\nMarket Planning Manager\nAmpex Corporation\n93l Charter Street\nRedwood City, California\nDear Bob:\nI ean*t restrain myself from expressing our enthusiasm, pride and\ngratitude to Ampex for the wonderful plans you've come through with\nfor the Convention, and the splendid special NAEB Convention mailÂ¬\nings you've sent out. This is the kind of co-working we like. More\npower to your fine firm, and all of you there.\nA minor post-script: no word yet from the Foundation, Probably\nnot for a long while have we more prayerfully tept our fingers\ncrossed, He'd love to have an announcement and press release by\nConvention time. But, being a bit superstitious on this point,\nI can only report that, at this point, our hopes are sinking a\nbit at the absence, so far, of word, following the late September\nBoard meeting date listed in Mr, Brown's letter of acknowledgment.\nI'd guess, at this late date, there's nothing more we can do. Let\nus know if you think of anything.\nMeanwhile, see you at Detroit.\nSincerely,\nHany J. Skornia\nExecutive Director\nHJStJO\nBlcc: ^William Harley\nRichard Hull\nFrank Schooley\nJanes Miles\nRobert Sc he nick an\nHarold Hill"
