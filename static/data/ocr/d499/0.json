I con¬\nfess that I haven’t had a chance to do more than riffle\nthrough them, but I will get around to a more deliberate\nstudy during the Holidays.\nI would very much liked to have been there at the Singapore\nmeeting, but its Juxtaposition so close to our own national\nconvention made it impossible. We had a very successful\nmeeting in Denver with over 3,500 people in attendance and\na special greeting direct from the White House By the\nPresident.\n1 am sending you a copy of a special convention issue of the\nnewsletter and directing that you be put on the mailing list\nso that you will be kept abreast of our activities.\nSincerely yours.\nWGH:lm\nWilliam G. Harley"
