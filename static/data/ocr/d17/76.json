But since I’m leaving today for Alabama and won’t be in\nmuch before about September 6, I’ve made a couple of marginal notes and passed\non to Schooley, in case anything occurs to him, if he has more time than I do\ntoday. If so you’ll hear from him direct.\nDetails! l) two iaillian(s) lire (p,l)\n2) I assume (p,2) only NAEB member ETV Stations could broadcast under\nArticle 6c?\nArticle 10 s Only NAEB is involved from the U* S, Right?\nI assume the Organization can distribute prize money (Article 19)\nas it sees fit.\nLooks carefully and fairly done. Hope we can hit it sometime.\nOur best,\n\\\nHJSidfc\nHarry J, Skoraia\nExecutive Director"
