Mott\nExecutive Director\nNational Educational Radio\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nDear Bob:\nI've just been looking at Memo to Managers No. 73, which asks about\nthe effect on CPB-supported stations of the proposed amendment\nrequiring stations to \"keep records, including audio recordings, for\na reasonable period of time of each program broadcast which involves\nan issue of public importance.\"\nWe have been under a regulation like this laid down by the Board of\nRegents at the University of Minnesota ever since World War II, and\nhave never found the requirement particularly difficult. In fact,\nmuch material of that type is broadcast from pre-recorded tapes\nanyway; and when this is not the case, we make recordings. In fact,\na certain amount of this is just good management, whether or not\nrequired by law.\nIt could be that the three month requirement* would be difficult--\nalthough I suppose with government matters moving as slowly as they\ndo, this is about the shortest time that could be required.\nAnyway, my opinion is that this would not be a restrictive amendment\nnor difficult to comply with for KUOM. Whether it would be for a\nvery small station, with only one or two tape recorders, is another\nmatter. But from my point of view, it would present no problems.\n.-ly\nBurton Paulu\nDirector\nRadio and Television\nBP: da"
