Every effort should be made to carefully audition all individual programs before\nthey are distributed to member stations » Such auditions will be conducted by a\nresponsible person*\n3o Based on the auditions indicated in 2, the Network Manager will:\na. Withdraw any undesirable pro grams •\nb. Notify stations well in advance of any material that may raise questions\nof taste, obscenity, ethics, and similar problems <>\nc. Notify stations in all cases where individual programs have not been so\nscreened•\nU. Network headquarters will solicit, secure, and distribute available scripts\nand other descriptive materials about series and individual programs# This\nshould include all materials useful in the promotion of NAEB programs.\nThe above measures will apply within the limits of time and personnel#\n6c None of the above is designed to relieve station managers of any responsibilityo\nThe network cannot guarantee that all programs will conform to individual sta¬\ntion policy or to the strictest rules and regulations in all cases# Both\nlegally and morally the broadcast licensee assumes full responsibility for\neverything broadcast by its transmittero This is intended to be assurance that\nnetwork headquarters will do all it can to make the editing job as easy as\npossible."
