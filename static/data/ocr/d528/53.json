Hulsen\nDirector Radio Projects\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting\n555 Madison Avenue\nNew York City, New York 10022\nDear Als\nThis is a brief narrative on the status of the $65,000 CPB\nprogramming grant to NERN. The first financial report is not due\nuntil December 31, but I want to keep you apprised.\nAs I reported in Madison, procurement of tape to permit hour\nlong program distribution has been completed. This more efficient\nservice will begin in October.\nSeveral programs have been procured for network distribution,\nI am akking Miss Landreth to send you a copy of the October-November-\nDecember offering and identify those programs and series made\navailable through CPB funds.\nThe general observation X want to make is that I think the NER\naffiliates are receiving andamazing bargain in the quality and\nquantity of programs the network staff will procure or produce as\na result of this grant.\nWe are keeping a balance in the funds to insure that we can\nduplicate and distribute the series being produced by the direct\nstation grants. As I understand it, not many of those will be\navailable for the next quarter offering.\nIn summary, we forsee no difficulties or problems with the\nprogram grant and feel that, as of this date, all is well.\nSometime when you are in Washington you and Miss Landreth\nshould spend a few minutes reviewing program matters. I am delegating\nthe network operation to her, and she is much better qualified than I\nto review the details of this grant with you.\nPlease let me know if there is additional information needed at\nthis time.\nSincerely,\nRAM:kh\n<r?f i T.anrtrofh\nKobert A. Mott"
