Would you say that the growth of political democracy (extension of the suff¬\nrage, etc.) tends to increase the likelihood that aristocrats of talent and\nvirtue will he elected to high public office? If not, why not?\n8. What do you think Jefferson's reaction would be to the attacks in our own\ntime on \"brain trusters\"? What would Adams say about them?\n9. Consider the following quotation from Adams: \"The fundamental article of my\ncreed is that despotism ... is the same in a majority of a popular assembly\nan aristocratic council, an oligarchical junta, and a single emperor-. Equally\narbitrary, cruel, bloody, and in every respect diabolical\" (p. l64 in radio¬\nscript) . Apply this to our own country or any other at the present time, to\nshow where the greatest danger of despotism lies.\n10. What do you think Adams meant when he recommended a \"balanced government\" as\nthe best means to prevent any of these tyrannies? Do contemporary conflicts\nin the United States between the legislative and executive branches of the\ngovernment have any bearing on the question?\n11. What means did Jefferson suggest to assure the election of \"the wise and good\"\nto public office? Can you suggest any others?\n12. Spell out \"wise and good\" in the light of our own times. That is, what sort\nof qualities should we look for in our leaders and what sort should we avoid?\n13. Can you think of anything in our time which would discourage desirable lead¬\ners from assuming public office?\n14. Do you agree with the statement of Adams that the science of government has\nstood still, while all other sciences have advanced? If so, what is your ex¬\nplanation?\n15. Make any suggestions you can about bettering the practice of government.\nSuggestions for Reading\nRadioscript in The Jeffersonian Heritage, Ch.
