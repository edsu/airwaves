If we are considering the education of children in\nmany raid-west towns, it is probably not possible for them to talk\nto Spanish children in person or to see live Spanish dances* Per¬\nhaps here is a place to use television or film; *1111 these do the\nsame job? Axe they better than other methods which might be employed\nin such communities to foster feelings of wonderment or to stimulate\nintellectual curiosity? tfe are now coming closer to defining re-\nsearchable questions* If the analyses have been carefully carried\nout, good educational questions are bound to be generated because\nwe then know the dimensions of our problem and the content, methods,\ngoals, and media to be investigated* By knowing the specific con¬\ntent and the methods which are to achieve each goal, refinement of\ntesting procedures is made possible*"
