Y.\n7 October 1952\nMr. barker wheatley\nWGBH, Lovell Institute\nBroadcasting Council\nBoston, Massachusetts\nDear Barkeri\nBoth of your letters arrived this morning (Oct. 6). I think\nI have arranged to handle this in the most expeditious way possible.\nHere are the details.\nI do not have a full and up-to-date list of MAS* members.\nMiles, however, does have one down at Urban*. I investigated and\nfound that the University of Minnesota and the University of Illinois\nare both connected by teletype and that I could have the text of the\namendment teletyped down to Urbana for a couple of dollars. I\narranged, therefore, to have this done and meanwhile called Miles*\nsecretary in Urbana asking her to be reedy for it, to duplicate it\nand to mail it out this afternoon, and to get it touch with me by\ntelephone or telegraph if there should be any snafu in the trans¬\nmission of the amendment.\n1 hope that all goes well and that it reaches the members in\ntime, strictly speaking, thirty days are supposed to elapse between\nnotification and voting so that if this doesn't reach the members\nby October 8, they might object to voting on it November 5. However,\n1 think it should be distributed in time.\nI hope that this works out satisfactorily.\nI m sorry about this business of receiving your call collect.\nIt isn't difficult for tm to make calls out and charge them to ay\nhome phone and then reimbursing myself with NAhh funds. But to\nreceive a call collect from outside at a university number and have\nit charged to some other number than that one is just too dam com¬\nplicated! Please forgive me for turning the charge back on you.\nWith best personal regards,\nfours sincerely.\nBPtcjm\n__ Burton Pauiu\n'\"Secretary and Public aTIdns '\nEditor\nRepresenting non commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
