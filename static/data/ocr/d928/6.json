Skornia\n(\nMany times Bob Underwood, Jesse Trump and I have discussed the predicament of the\nNAEB Network in the event of a serious breakdown of one of our two Ampex Model\n300 recorders. As you know, these are used in making “masters1* from the program\ntapes which we receive. This dubbing is necessary because of the varying head\nazimuth found on the program tapes. We adjust azimuth on the playback machine\nto give maximum high frequency response while the recording machine^ head align¬\nment has been set with the standard alignment tape used on the Multitape Duplicators.\nWhile this dubbing of “masters“ 12QOQC mates: makes an additional generation\nof the tapes, we believe it will always be necessary. It could only be discon¬\ntinued in the event that we recorded the original program tapes so that all\nX recording and playback head azimuth alignment could be maintained.\nThe present Ampex Model 300 Recorders were purchased in March, 1952, nearly\nfive years ago. Since that time they have been in continuous daily use and are\nin need of a major overhaul. The reel spindles of the playback machine have\nbecome so worn that they must soon be replaced* This means replacing take up\nand rewind motors - a major operation. We do not believe this step should\nbe undertaken without having a stand by machine available.\nTherefore we are recommending the immediate purchase of at least one Ampex\n^fodel 300C Tape recorder so that the present machines may be given a complete\noverhaul one at a time without the possibility of interrupting network service.\nWe understand that funds are available which could be used to cover the purchase\ncost. The price quoted is f2,216.00 which may be subject to an educational\ndiscount.\nSincerely,\nCecil S. Bidlack\nRobert E. Underwood\nCSB :dfc 2/1/57"
