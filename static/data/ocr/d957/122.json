SIEGEL\nWNYC, Municipal Broadcasting System\n2500 Municipal Building\nNew York 7, N. Y.\nOctober 1, 195>2\nDear Allen:\nThere seems to be some confusion and doubt floating\naround as to Tom Rishworth's worth to educational\nradio now that \"he is rendered impotent by the strain\nof emotional crises.\" I would like to go on record\nin support of Tom and state my views and reasons why\nI think, along with others, that Tom is entirely\ncapable of maintaining and upholding any educational\nradio office offered him.\nIn doing so, perhaps a brief sketch of the recent\nupheaval at Radio House is in order.\nThe issue was so clouded that not even Tom, as I see\nit, can be exactly clear on what happened. However,\ntwo points do seem clear: two psycopathic personali¬\nties were involved—one a woman in the script office,\nthe other a man in the general office. Both people\nplayed heavily on Tom's bigheartedness to hold their\njobs. That Tom should have fired them, or at least\none of them, is probably without question. The woman\nin the script office had tried to undermine Tony\nLumphin, Elithe Beale and A1 Chapman. They left their\njobs before she \"got\" them. Hers is a feeling of \"to\nkeep my job secure, I've got to discredit the top man.\"\nIt was a challenge to Tom to get along with her.\nExamine her case in this light. After complete re¬\nwriting at times by Gale Adkins, at times by Tom, other\ntimes by me, some of her \"scripts\" won national re¬\ncognition—in her name. Neither the Radio Committee\nnor the Presidents Office could fully understand firing\na woman with such nationally recognized ability. But\nask Gale Adkins why he thinks the scripts of \"Leather-\nbritches\" looked good to the Peabody people, or check\nv/ith A1 Chapman on the background of \"Healthy Living\nIn Our Country.\" These are but two examples! So,\nTom's decision was that if he couldn't have support\nin firing her, he would get along with her. And for\nsix years he didl In those six years he made Radio\nHouse a nationally known and respected institution.\nThe situation which made it necessary for Tom to\ncompromise with, instead of getting rid of this woman,\nis a University of Texas situation; not a Tom Rishworth\nsituation. To support this point I merely ask you to\nanswer the question: Why was the Radio Committee, in\nthe period from May to September of this year, unable\nto find anyone willing to step into the untenable\nsituation there?\nRepresenting non-commercial, educational, radio and television stations, workshops, and production\ncenters, owned and operated by colleges, universities, school systems and public-service agencies."
