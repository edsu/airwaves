Con.\nIstanbul\nSPORT :\nCOMPOSITION AMD ROLE OF PROPOSED SMALL WORKING PARTY ON THIS SUBJECT\nThe Bureau felt that there would \"be considerable advantage\nin the Committee having available to it a small working party on\nsport which would establish a calendar of forthcoming sports events,\ndecide on which of these would require EBU action and, generally,\nalert the Committee on any pertinent sporting question.\nGenerally speaking, the Bureau envisaged that such a group\nwould undertake its consultations either in writing or by telex or\nby telephone, though obviously there would be occasions when it would\nbe necessary for it to meet. The Bureau felt that it should be as\nsmall as possible and therefore now proposes to the Committee that\nan ad hoc working party of radio sports experts be constituted under\nthe chairmanship of Dr S. Molo (SSR) with one representative each\nfrom ARD, BBC, ORTF, RAI and SR. The Secretary of the Committee\nhas sought the approval in principle of these organizations and so\nfar has learned that the ARD representative will be Mr Rudi Michel\n(SWF), the BBC representative Mr Robert Hudson and the SR represen¬\ntative Mr Per-Olof Wester. The Secretary expressed the hope that\nthe Committee’s sports advisor, Mr Giorgio Boriani (RAI), might be\nmade available for this purpose.\nThe Committee is invited to consider the above and, if\nit agrees with these proposals of the Bureau, to put forward a\nformal recommendation to the Administrative Council in respect\nof the creation of this Working Party."
