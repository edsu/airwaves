Hull\nChairman NAEB Foundation Committee\n14 Gregory Hall\nUrbana, Illinois\nDear Dick:\nThanks for your good note of March 1st. I shall he\nhappy to talk with any or all of you about the NAEB situ¬\nation at your convenience. 1 am also glad to have word\nabout the projected meeting late in May which you are\nplanning to hold. So far as 1 know the three days you have\nselected do not conflict with any other commitments al¬\nthough there is a possibility that 1 may have to be out of\nthe country at that time.\nAt a risk of being a bore I can only reiterate one of\nthe observations which I made to you when you were in the\noffice a few days ago. With respect to the meeting 1 should\nsay that I am much less concerned with the auspices and\nthe mechanics of invitations and sponsorship than I am with\nwhat may be accomplished therefrom. Whether or not the\nmeeting is a success seems to me to depend on whether\nor not the agenda is addressed to fundamentals more than\nwhether specific organisations or indeed even individuals\nparticipate.\nIt was good to have the opportunity to talk with you\nand I trust that it will not be so long before we get together\nagain.\nSincerely,\nJohn K. Weiss\nEducation Program\ncc: Burton Paulu\nFrank Schooley\nHenry Cheydeyne\nJames Miles\nHarry Skomia"
