And dazzling white sand ground fine by the ages\nfrom granite, drapes the long shore lines of the Inland Sea,\n£THEME2 „ JJP AND OUT BRIEFLY\nFor a discussion of themes and perspectives in modem Japanese\nliterature, Mr. Lerch has invited the distinguished author and\nteache r, Mr. Hisaka zu Kaneko.\nIt is a privilege, indeed, to have Mr. Kaneko with us. First\nof all, Kenyon-educated Proffessor Kaneko teaches English in\nTokyo at St. Paul*s Episcopal College. Right now his book,\nManiiro. the Man Who Discovered America is causing much favorahw\ncomment. TIME, July 23, 1956, devoted considerable space to It\nSuppose, however, we let the author make domofc6nments on it\nand tell us how he came to write it„\nThe story is well known in Japan, but not in America,,\nMoving from your very interesting book, Mr, Kaneko which I\nbelieve will establish better understanding between Japan and\nAmerica, Ifd like to ask you who are the best known authors\n(American authors) in Japan?\n(2) Do you think that these modern American writers have\ninfluenced Japanese writers?\nWitness this book we have before us, Mr. Lerch, ID DERM JAPANESE\nFICTION by John W. Iforrison.. .which, is a fine, scholarly,\ntreatment of themes, ideas, and the overfall history of modern\nJapanese fiction.\nIn the current state of Japanese letters, would you say that\na certain pessimism a certain confusion exists in this post\nwar period. Or how would you characterize the new writing?\nIs there anything over here to match the esoteric experimentallsa\nof the French with their existentialism? * Or other intellectual\nschools of thought?"
