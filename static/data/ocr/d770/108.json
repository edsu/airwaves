SYDNEY\n7th February 1968\nDear Mr Harley,\nSome time ago Sir Charles sent to all ABU members a questionnaire\nrequesting information about the number of copies of the ABU Statutes,\nas amended at the last General Assembly, which your organisation would\nlike to have,\nWe^not appear to have received your reply and, as the reprinting of\nthe Statutes has now been completed, we are sending one copy to you\nwith the February issue of the ABU Newsletter, If you would like\nto have more copies, we will happy to send them to you.\nThe new Statutes have a gray cover, to make it easy to distinguish\nthem from the earlier edition which had a pale yellow cover. We\nwould like to suggest that your copies of the earlier edition should\nnow be destroyed, as they are out-of-date and their continued existence\nmight cause Confusion,\nSir Charles also sent to all members last November a questionnaire\nasking about the number of copies of the Proceedings of the last ABU\nGeneral Assembly they would like to have. In this case also we\ndo not seem to have your answer, so I am enclosing another copy of the\nquestionnaire.\nYours sincerely,\nBETTY COOK\nAssistant to Secretary-General\nMr William G. Harley,\nPresident,\nNational Association of Educational Broadcasters,\n1346 Connecticut Avenue N.W.,\nWASHINGTON. D.C. 20036,\nU.S.A."
