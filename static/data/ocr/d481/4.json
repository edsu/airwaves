Naturally, this being an NAB group, no one from\neducational broadcasting was there. But I think this is something\nwe ought to work on. Maybe Leonard Marks, who seems to know his way\naround in Democratic political circles, could arrange, either to\nget us in on another event of that kind, or better yet, arrange a\nspecial session between some folks in &AEB and President Kennedy.\nThis would be a tremendous prestige gesture for educational broadcasting.\nIncidentally, I know very well the principal assistant to\nSenator Humphrey, Bill Connell, a^d would be glad to ask him to\ngive some help on this if you should need some.\nWith best personal regards,\nYours sincerely,\nBurton Paulu\nDirector of Radio and\nTelevision Broadcasting\nBP:kk\nP.S. With me back on the board, you’re going to hear from me often.’"
