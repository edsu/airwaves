Associate membership is\navailable to such institutions who do not own teismitter facilities but\nregularly produce educational programs over commercial outlets* Affili¬\nate membership is open to any individual or organisation interested in\neducational broadcasting. Carrier current, or wired*wireless stations\nare not eligible for Active membership*\nActive members pay dues, based on transmitter power, ranging from $15.\nto $100. Associate and Affiliate members pay dues of 10 annually. All\nof these dues include an annual subscription to our monthly Newsletter.\nI do not have a greal deal of information about the use of carrier-current\nstations in high schools and elementary schools, but I do believe that\nsome such stations are in existence. In addition several school systems,\nand even individual high schools and junior high schools, operate regu¬\nlar broadcasting stations, and most of these are members of our Associ¬\nation*\nAt the present time there are not a large number of positions open in the\neducational broadcasting field, although such openings do appear with some\ndegree of regularity. Our Association operates a Placement Service to\ninformation and would like to file an application with the Placement Serv¬\nice, please direct your inquiry to Mr. Robert Underwood at this same ad¬\ndress.\nSincerely,\nHarold S. Hill\nAssociate Director"
