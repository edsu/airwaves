However, in the\nlow price field, there is now available a 3 -2 pulldown projector suitable for color,\nor black and white, having either optical or magnetic sound available, manufactured\nby Bell & Howell, and called \"The Jan\" Bell & Howell projector. It costs under\n$2,000 and requires servicing only every 2000 hours off operation, as opposed to the\nnormal 100 hours between servicing on most other projectors,. This projector,\nalong with one manufactured by Page, was seen in use at most of the low cost\ninstallation demonstrations c\nNEW AM TRANSMITTERS:\nOne of the exhibits at the RCA 1 th if the n.^TD chaw featured a\nspecial tube - A RCA 6671 multistrand thoriated tungsten filament high power tube\nfor AM transmitters. This tube is featured in a new amplitude-modulation process\nRCA is introducing and which RCA says will revolutionise AM broadcasting as\nmuch as did the high-level modulation circuit of a few years ago.
