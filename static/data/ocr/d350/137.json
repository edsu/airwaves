Thus we shall have a\nhouse ready for his successor.\nMy advice to you is that you do not plan\nthe large seminar type of meetii^gJToj* mid-October, but\nrather postpone it until after th| convention.\nMy further advice is that you call together\nthe committee on the directorship in mid-October only\nif by that time you have two or three strong candidates\nwho look as though they would be satisfactory and whom\nyou could call in at the time of the meeting for an\ninterview. If you do not have such candidates by that\ntime, I suggest that you postpone the committee meeting\nuntil the days just before the convention.\nFinally, I hope you will let me know if\nyou have changed your mind about your own availability.\nWith very best wishes, I am\nSincerely yours,\nWilbur Schramm\nDean"
