In Thornton Wilder’s words, \"every good and excellent\nthing . . . stands moment by moment on the razor-edge of danger. \" The\nincreasing demands for new skills and higher scholarship, coupled with the\ngrowing shortages of teachers and facilities, give a surgical urgency to the\nnation’s educational needs.\nWhat must be done to alter educational television’s fragmentized\ncharacter, to move its electronic signals into classrooms from coast to\ncoast, to link its varied elements in a planned program of growth?\nMuch has been written and spoken of educational television’s\nbright promise in terms of individual experiments, but I believe its ultimate\npromise can be realized only from an overall approach, because the individual\nexperiment is too small to show the way.\nFor this reason, my discussion today will be directed at outlining\nsuch an approach, estimating its cost, and suggesting possible steps to\nimplement it. Perhaps with this as a background, some of the fertile minds\nin this room and elsewhere in education and broadcasting, can refine and\nimprove my suggestions in order to bring the most urgent necessity of our\ntimes into being more quickly."
