It\nlearns how to visualize sound in a variety\nof ways.\n(g) The phonetic alphabet was a further tech¬\nnological step. It divorced the sounds\nand visual forms of letters from \"meaning”.\nIt created a means of having \"average sounds\"\nfor a wide range of actual speech patterns.\nThis happens again to-day, with words\nthemselves, when we try to build a trans¬\nlating \"machine\" or language computer. The\nmultiple meanings and shades of words must\nbe averaged as we learn in Information Theory.\n(i) The phonetic alphabet, with its structure of\naverages, gave the West the power to\ntranslate into its sign system any language\nat all. It became a means of cultural and\npolitical conquest and control.\n(See H. A. Innis, Empi re and Communic at ions«\nOxford University Press, 1950).\n(j) Why Is similar conquest not possible for\nother kinds of writing such as the Chinese?"
