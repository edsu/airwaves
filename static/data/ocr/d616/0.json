W* Early\nAss1t Mgr* Recording & Record Sales\nRCA Manufacturing Company, Inc*\nCamden, Hew Jersey\nDear Mr. Early;\nPlease accept my thanks for the Information you sent\nregarding the broadcasting of Victor and Bluebird records\nby educationally owned and operated radio stations. I am\npassing along the data regarding yoxir willingness to give\npenalscion for use of records until such time as definite\nlicense agreements can be worked out.\nMay I urge that when your license agreements are made out\nthat you make special provisions for the educational radio\nstations. As you perhaps know these stations now enjoy\ncomplimentary licenses from A.8,0.A.P* an the Society of\nRecording Artists because they are operated on a non~\ncommerolal basis. I feel sure RCA will wish to make similar\nprovision for the educational station.\nCordially yours,\nFrank E. bohooley"
