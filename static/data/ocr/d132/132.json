You will certainly\nhear from me again in a week's time or less.\nI understand that Mr. Levy has been working with you for one month on a\ntrial basis# I would appreciate it if you would indicate your feelings\nabout his work. Perhaps you can also give us an account of what has been\ndone of a concrete nature on the \"basic\" course materials. I think it\nwould be wise to tell Mr. Levy that we canâ€™t continue to employ him\nbeyond this point until we are all agreed on the results of the trial\nmonth.\nSincerely,\nJAF:sc\nJames A. Fellows\nAssistant Director"
