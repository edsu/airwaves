  "text": "-3-\nDuring my tenure as Executive Director we held the first regional con¬\nference of the NAEB in Norman, Oklahoma, and the second in Chapel Hill, North\nCarolina. Shortly after I returned to Purdue, we had the third Regional Con¬\nference at Ann Arbor, Michigan. Having been able to attend all of these, the\nConference of REGION VI was my first miss. I regret this on two counts,\nfirst, that I wasn*t able to visit with all the good people there, and sec¬\nond, that I wasn*t able to get across the GREAT DIVIDE. 1*11 rectify the\nlatter but the former is lost forever.\nI was glad to see that Ausmus, Skornia and Schooley were present. The\nNAEB certainly owes a debt of gratitude it will never be able to repay to\nthese three individuals.\nThe mixture of old timers and newcomers was good, too. You have been\nwith the organization for a long time as have Jimmie Morris, Ed Adams and\na number of others. Pat Greene and Ed Barrett 1511 remember for their con¬\ntribution to the Allerton House School Seminar, Slimmer of *£2, Therefore,\nnames were not just names to me but very real personalities. I could almost\nhear each individual say what the written word says they said.\nAs usual, I find it difficult to argue with Ausmus. His opening state¬\nments in this case certainly set the proper tone. This together with the\nplanning evident in the organization of the Workshop gave those attending a\nsense of real direction. I can?t help but smile every time Graydon mentions\nthe \"Fifth Largest Network\" but I realize how true this really is. I realize,\ntoo, the truth in his statement that this is a cooperative organization which\ntaps the outstanding resources, talent-wise and production-wise of our major\ncolleges, universities, and school systems, not only in the United States,\nbut also throughout the world. On these two pillars the NAEB rests. There\ncould be no better foundation. This, I agree with Ausmus, must be maintained."
