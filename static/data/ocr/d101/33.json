You were included in the roster of\nthis Committee which I originally seat to Chatman Seeker,\nbut somehow in transmitting the information on all the committee\nmerabers to headquarters your name was inadvertently omitted.\nAnyway, it*s good to see you*re already working as a rseraber\nof the Committee and making your usual valuable contributions.\nThis note, then, is just to provide official recognition of a\n’situation in being'\"' and extend my personal welcome and appre¬\nciation for your willingness to serve.\nWilliam C.
