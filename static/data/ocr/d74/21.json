The rest of\nthe enclosures are descriptive material\nand a questionnaire which I hope you\nwill either respond ^o, or direct to\nthe proper persons with regard particuÂ¬\nlarly to Iowa University.\nTime and funds prevent all the\npersonal visits which, ideally, should\nbe made. I wonder if there would be\nany possibility of arranging for\nseveral Iowa-area people to meet at\nsome reasonably central point in the\nstate? Is the IJCET scheduled for a\nmeeting soon? Or x^ould a visit with\nMr. Dancer serve the same purpose?\n/lUJWW\n(W fjf\nrtm ollcma tfflosvn\nT~;'4M}$Tlnr\na J. STANLEY"
