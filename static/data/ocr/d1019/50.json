Bob\nBrooks, with a letter requesting approval of the NAEB of his question*\nnaire and asking for comments on the questionnaire* I thought it might\nbe better if I replied to you rather than to Brooks, and then you can\ndelete any suggestions which you don't like before you pass it on,\nsince he is your candidate*\nIn response to his first question, 1 see no reason why the NAEB should\nnot approve of this* I think Skomia should be contacted for official\napproval, but I think that it's a good thing to do* I would suggest\nthat you ask Skornia if it is all right to indicate that the results\nwill be distributed to all member stations through the Journal or the\nNewsletter* This, too, would increase response*\nI have noted my reactions to the questionnaire on the form itself,\nwherever thoughts have occurred to me. As I indicated above, you can\nthrow these out or pass them on, as you see fit* I think that he will\nget the most good data out question 7*\nHave a good Sumner*\nBest,\nSamuel L* Becker\nDirector, Division of\nTelevision-Radio-Film\nSLB:ks\nEnel: Questionnaire"
