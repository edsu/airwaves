  "text": "After Seeing the Program:\n• What did you think of the program in terms of interest, clarity,\ntruth, beauty, /ura?\n• What new ideas or information did you gain?\n• What did you get from the program that we can all use at school\nor in our daily lives?\n• Was there something you didn’t understand?\n• Where can you get additional information?\nEncourage and assist children to extend the film information\nthrough the use of such resources as books, periodicals, encyclo¬\npaedias, films, filmstrips, pictures, maps and globes.\nChildren will be stimulated by the programs, so teachers should be prepared to\nguide them to undertake further interesting activities such as reading, writing songs,\npoetry, stories, plays, programs, modeling in clay, painting, dramatizing, making\nmodels, experimenting. The class might go on an appropriate school journey or\ninvite a specialist such as a fireman, nurse or scientist, to talk to them. A bicycle\npractice session could be held on the school yard to demonstrate bicycle and pedes¬\ntrian safety. Children could check their own homes for fire hazards, etc."
