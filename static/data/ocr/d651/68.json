Harley, President\nNational Association of Educational\nBroadcasters\nDuPont Circle Office Building\n1346 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington 6, D.C.\nDear Bill:\nIn reply to your memo of May 25th rfe experimental television production,\nu I stand behind my statement at the Board Meeting that I would favor NAEB\ntrying television production on an experimental basis. I share many of\nthe doubts and concerns of Loren Stone on this matter, but think that the\nonly way to prove the value of such a service to the NAEB and to the\nmembers may be to set up a trial run and see how it goes\nA brief discussion with Jack White indicated no opposition or hostility on\nhis part to the NAEB proposal.' In fact, John Schwarzwalder's fears I think\nare completely groundless. If anything, I get the feeling that this clears\nthe air so far as both organizations are concerned â€” with both now being\nfree to do what they want to do in whatever field they chose.\nThis may pose problems for those of us who hold membership and affiliate\nstatus with both organizations; but at least on the administrative level\nthe situation has been clarified, h\nWith best wishes .\nSincerely,\nHartford N.
