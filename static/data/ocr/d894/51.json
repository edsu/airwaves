Free speech requires not only that men\nhe free to speak their minds hut that they, in this 30th century of mass audience,\nhave access to technical facilities to speak their minds.“\n“That those who sit in the studios and master control rooms of our stations and\nnetworks must never forget their status is a trustee. By virtue of his great\ndegree of control over this major means of mass communication, the broadcaster\nspeaks more loudly than any single citizen. He must not use this privilege to\nshout the citizen down. And, If as a trustee, he betrays this trust, then he\nhas made mockery of that privilege he has fought to gain, and should bear the\nconsequences. *\n\"That this and the other freedoms are fed and preserved on principle and concern\nfor the common welfare, and not by additional rules and regulations—that censorship\nis always vicious and bad—that the broadcasters who seek the right to editorialise\nand who now maintain that the FCC is violating their constitutional rights, must\nwell remember, if the privilege becomes theirs, the burden of protecting free\nspeech has then become their major trust. They will have then become not seekers\nand supplicants, but administrators and stewards\nTours sincerely.\nHBHsmp\n&& : All NAEB Officers\nA111NAEB Directors\nEdwin Helman, WBO®\nWilbur Schramm\nHarold Engel, WHA\nDitto copy to?
