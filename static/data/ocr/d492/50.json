S. Jalker of Florida, in an inaugura\nADDRESS OF DECEMBER 20, 1865, PRAISING THE NEGRO FOR\nHIS FAITHFULNESS TO SOUTHERN WHITES, IN WAR AND PEACE\nThe Governor notes that it is not the Negroes’ fault\nTHAT THEY ARE FREE. He A, DDS, ,?BUT THEY ARE FREE*\nThey are no longer our happy contented slaves, with\nAN ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF F 0 00 AND CLOTHING FOR THEMSELVE\nAND FAMILIES, AND THE INTELLIGENCE OF A SUPERIOR RACE\nTO LOOK AHEAD AND MAKE ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR\nTHEIR C OM FO R T ’. The IDYLLIC PICTURE OF THE NEGRO’S\nCONDITION UNDER SLAVERY IS, TO PUT IT AS MILDLY AS\nPOSSIBLE, VERY nFpATAotc, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HER\nof is the Governor’s bland assumption of the\nSUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE OF WHITES. It SOUNDS AS IF\nTHIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF ARGUMENT FOR HIM\nAT ALL.\nIT STRIKES ME LOU, THAT THIS SORT OF AN IMAGE. ..THE\nONE OBVIOUSLY HELD BY GOVERNOR WALKER...IS A SURVIVAL\nOF A PRE-CIVIL WAR IMAGE.\nIT IS, AND THERE’S A POINT TO BE MADE HERE, THAT IS\nTHAT THE PRE-CIVIL WAR IMAGES, PARTICULARLY THOSE\nANTAGONISTIC TO THE NEGRO WERE RE-ENFORCED AND AUG¬\nMENTED by Reconstruction conditions and experience.\nB . \"Ci. .Truman., at jdur^ia l i st who, after thef.C i v i llWarl -■\nREPORTED ’.ON CONDITIONS) I N !
