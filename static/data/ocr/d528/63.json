  "text": "NER/PS would continue to be a corporate entity of the NAEB.\nThis would continue the NAEB/NER/NER/PS identity and, incidentally,\nwould make possible membership in the professional-trade association\nactivities of NAEB/NER by all institutions. Legal restrictions on\nmany tax supported institutions deny membership in professional\nassociations. The program service as a part of the professional\nassociation would overcome this difficulty for radio stations.\nContinuing present policy, NER/PS would be available only to\nthose stations holding membership in NAEB/N1R.\nAll classes and types of stations are eligible for NAEB/NER\nmembership in accord with the NAEB constitution. An overt effort\nto increase radio station membership in NER is a responsibility\nof the NAEB.\nFees and assessments for membership and the library cannot be\ncalculated at this time. The parameters should include; (1) Low\nenough cost to encourage membership and maximum utilization of the\nlibrary. (2) Charges adequate to make the service viable and effective.\nIt continues to be the judgment of the NAEB/NER staff that support\ngrants for NER and for NER/PS will be required. Consideration of this\nfactor is related to the schedule of dues and fees and will be\ndeveloped at a later date.\nThe long range goal will be the development of a tape library and\na public radio professional association that is self sustaining. Both\nNER and NERN are presently supported at a level that allows both to\noperate with a modest supplus. It should be understood, however, that\nNER and NERN services are curtailed by the limited means now\navailable.\nRAM:kh"
