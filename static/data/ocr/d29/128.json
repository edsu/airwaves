That is why\nJohn Wain, the distinguished\nEnglish novelist, describes Mar¬\nshall McLuhan as “the most\nconsiderable social philosopher\nof our day.'\nMany others are prepared to\ndeclare themselves devotees of\nMarshall McLuhan I suspect\nthat one reason for this is his\nwillingness to accept and tin\nderstand people aid their qual¬\nities without tryisg to compare\nthese people o>- oualities with\npreconceived standards.\nLike so many clever Cana*\ndians, he is mee-there is -*1\nother word.

Dr. McLuhan has\nstudied this question for a long\ntime. It Is not merely because\nchildren are interested in tele¬\nvision; children net interested\nin television normally also re¬\ntain more when they are taught\nsomething “through’ s televi¬\nsion set.\nn lies in the\nthrough” — the lesson\ncomes “through” tie set and\nthe receiver is the student.\nThe television screen Is not\nmerely a reflection airfare; it\nis a source of light that forms\nintelligible images \"inside” the\nstudent.\nBut this is a later and more\nla ted a good deal of proof that\neach medium seems te have a\nnature of its own, a nature that\naffects the subject matter that\nis being taught or transmited\nand affects also the whale lift\nof the recipient.\nTelevision Is closer in spirit\nto intimate participation in the\nlife of a small community. It Is\nsimultaneous” in\nthat one is seeing something at\nfirst hand, one is part of it as It\nhappens, whereas in a newsreel\none sees a record, and this\nseems to have little to do with\nthe timing of the telecast—a\nnewsreel shown on a television\ngives this same feeling\nabout how to perform a pat*\nticular operation when they\nwatch It on closed circuit tele¬\nvision—this is another of tha\nfacts Dr. McLuhan has been\naccumulating. The medical stu¬\ndents say they feel they have\nperformed the operation them¬\nselves.\nA teacher teaching In the\ntraditional way out of a mart\nprinted textbook cannot com¬\npete, especially when his stu¬\ndents have been exposed to\ntelevision. There is no point In\ndeploring this fact. The point Is\nhow best to use television or\nother modern media in the elasa*\n>om.\nObviously tha potentialities of\nthe medium are wasted when\nonly an ordinary lecture Is pro¬\njected—a real documentary on\nthe same subject would be much\nmore effective.\nStudies show that an even\nmore effective method may be\na dialogue — having an expert\nInterview an expert on tele-\nvision.\nHow expert should tho ex¬\nperts sound for each age group\nthey teach? What should thoy\nput their emphasis on? Which\nparticular aspects of television\nstimulate memory, help people\nlearn things and which stimu¬\nlate analytical thinking?\nMarshall McLuhan is going to\nproduce the answer, to write a\n\"grammar” on the use of media,\non when to use which medium\nand his work may well lead to\ncomplete overhaul ef tha\n!Ii .»l»<orvra*l,y terhnlcal -lory; suffice it te say N o r t h American educational\n«f thlv ho hasUhat Dr. McLuhan has acc«mu- ‘system. *mer,can educ*»°nal"
