  "text": "STATEMENT OF PROGRAM ACCEPTANCE STANDARDS\nThe following statement is Intended as a guide In the selection\nof programs for use by the Tape Network* Obviously few programs can\nmeet all the standards listed below; some programs excellently suited\nfor the Tape Network may meet only a few of them*\nThe Network as now constituted is to a large extent an outgrowth\nof the first Allerton House Radio Seminar of 195.9; therefore it is\nfitting that the committees should accept the basic educational\nprogramming principles determined at that meeting. As phrased by\nRobert B © Hudson* \"The Allerton seminar asserted that the aims of\neducational broadcasting are the broad alms of education:\n\"••eeducation in a democracy has the responsibility of\nlifting the level of understanding and appreciation of\nthe people* of giving the individual a knowledge of him~\nself and his society, and of the tensions and perplexities\nin each;\n”o*.In a free society it is essential that the Individual\nhave a continuing sense of belonging and participating* of\nkeeping up with a complex and fast-moving world;\n\"®®*it is the responsibility of education to foster and\nfurther that feeling of belonging and counting®\"A/\nThe committees further agree that programs chosen for the Tape\nNetwork should meet certain minimum standards as to: (1) network\nsuitability; (2) engineering standards; (3) audience appeal;\n(I4.) subject matter; and (5) presentation*\n1. Network Suitability• The programs distributed should\nbe of widespread interest and should be selected to\nsupplement the program resources of individual stations *\n2® Engineering Standards** The engineering standards of the\nprograms distributed shall conform to the standards\ndrawn up by the NAEB Tape Network Engineering Advisory\nCommittee®\n3® Audience Appeal® The programs should attract and hold\ntheir Intended audiences®\nSubject Matter. The programs - again in Hudson’s words -\nshould be t! distinguished by.® .high concern for integrity\nIn the selection®..of materials* and by®•.consistent\ndedication to social purpose.\" Subject matter chosen\nshould have the effect of:\n\"(1) informing*\n\"(2) stimulating the individual to organize and give\nmeaning to Information*\nIT Robert B.
