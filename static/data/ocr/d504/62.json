  "text": "- 2 -\nITEM 12 contd.\n(EDP) equipment in its respect.\nThe SR has received material from the ABC (Australia), BBC,\nDR, NOS, NRK, ORTF, RAI, RTB, YLE, the West German Sound Archives and\nthe Czech Radio. It has also been promised contributions from IBA and\nORF. Unfortunately, for financial reasons, SR has been compelled to\ncurtail all its EDP projects and at the present time there is no in¬\nformation available as to when these will be resumed. Mr Lindberg\nreports, however, that it is apparent already that there will be so\nmuch work to do in establishing a comprehensive list of the many\navailable recordings that it will almost certainly become necessary\nto engage a special person for this purpose. The task is much heavier\nthan originally envisaged and SR estimates that it will take one person\nat least 5 or 6 months of whole-time work to produce the finished\ncatalogue. SR is not itself able to provide such a person without\nsome financial assistance and when the Bureau of the Committee was\napprised of this fact it decided to ask its small expert group (for\ncomposition see sub-para, (b) above) to meet and bring forward a\nrecommendation on what should now be done. It certainly seems that\nsome financial contribution from members will be necessary if this\nimportant project is to succeed and the Committee therefore is asked\nto consider this new aspect and to decide on whether or not to pro¬\nceed and, if so, on how and to what extent the project shall be\nfinanced. The expert group plans to meet to consider this matter,\ntogether with other Sound Archive points, at the end of April and\nconsequently will require a clear directive from the Committee."
