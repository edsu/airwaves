C. 20036\nDear John:\nThe CPB Newsletter for Speteraber, 1969 (Volume I Number 3) is an\nexcellent public relations effort on the part of the Corporation staff.\nI would like to call your attention to the continuing misuse of the\nterm public broadcasting in the lead article, ’’Reaching for the Earth\".\nAs you know, the Kettering sponsored conference at Wingspread was a\npublic television conference. The newsletter article says that it was a\npublic broadcasting conference.\nThe term public broadcasting includes both radio and television.\nThe use of the term public broadcasting when only one medium is involved\nis confusing and misleading and creates a negative reaction. My hope is that\nthe Corporation staff can organize its vocabulary so that the terms public\nradio, public television and public broadcasting are used appropriately.\nCordially,\nRobert A. Mott\nRAM:kh"
