Kartin lias requested that I contact you regarding\nthe physical facilities for both membership and publicity disks for ADRT\nin the lobby of the Deshlei^Kilton during convention weak.\nI think the raost desirable situation fro© our point of view would be\ntwo separate tables, each large enough to comfortably seat two or three\npeople on one side. This would allow us to operate the membership desk\na foot or two assy from the publicity desk, in order to avoid congestion.\nIf this is not feasible, one large table would do. It should, hewever,\nbe a library or large office siae table, big enough to seat five or six\npeople on one side. Then, of course, we would need five or six chairs,\ntoo.\nIs there any possibility of our obtaining two canals which we would\nuse iy—t to the two tables in order to make a small 8AE!Sr unit**? If such\nis possible, then I will plan to bring scans large posters to display on\nthese easels\nI would appreciate it. Dr. Tyler, if you could let »e know as soon\nas possible just what facilities we can plan on so that we may make our\narrangements accordingly.\nThank you very much.\nSincerely,\nJohn Adams Rourke\nNational Membership Chairman\nA EHT\ncc: Professor Dale R.
