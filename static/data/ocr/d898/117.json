The time\ndelay is the factor at issue.\nThe question of the willingness of licensees in key markets to\ncommit their stations to all-network programming should be\nresolved.\nBefore the model is developed, firm commitments should be obÂ¬\ntained from key stations in a minimum of ten markets. To\ntest the model the fewer key affiliates would result in a\nlimited national reaction.\nInitiating a public radio service on a nine hour per day level\nminimum (as proposed) would create an economic and cultural\nshock that would prove detrimental to long range goals.\nMoving quickly from zero hours to nine or more per day would\nresult in these inherent difficulties:\nA. Funding. What sources, if any, are available\nto support the model? Network costs should relate\nto potential sources of support."
