Box 2002\nUniversity, Alabama\nDear Graydon:\nI was very happy to hear from you and to know that your group is\nconsidering Gale Adkins for the Executive Directorship of the National\nAssociation of Educational Broadcasters.\nAs you know, Gale has been connected with the University for 6 or\n7 years. Although I did not know him before the war, I have come to\nknow and appreciate him very much since my return from the Air Forces.\nWe have found Gale to be a capable administrator and exceptionally well-\nqualified in educational radio. I understand that he has completed all\nof his work toward the Ph. D. degree except the dissertation. He is a\nyoung man of very pleasant and congenial personality, cooperative, and\nindustrious. It is my opinion that he would make an excellent Executive\nDirector and would bring into the position a superior ability, particuÂ¬\nlarly in dealing with education people.\nDr. Dolley sent me a copy of the letter he wrote you in regard to\nGale, and I should like to add one further fact here. As Acting\nDirector of Radio House, Gale has indicated again an excellent ability\nin administration and in coordinating the efforts of the various members\nof Radio House.\nIt is a pleasure to recommend Gale to you as a person of excellent\nability and very good potentiality in the field of educational radio.\nCordially yours\nT.
