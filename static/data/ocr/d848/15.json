The teacher is at her desk, studying\nthe Guide.. .making notes.\nThe Narrator points out that there is more to beginning the use of a television lesson\nthan adjusting the blinds and turning on the set. Suppose you, as a classroom teacher,\nare making ready for such a lesson. Is the communication between you and the tele¬\nvision teacher complete? Did you acquaint yourself with the lesson plan sent out by the\ntelevision teacher?\nThen you know that the teacher is going to explore the living things around us and\nnote changes occurring in these things due to environment. What could you do as an\nintroduction? Let's look at a few minutes of such a lesson.. .and you decide what you\ncould have done.\nWe see a portion of the television lesson.. .and then come back to the Narrator.\n\"What could you have done to introduce this television lesson?\" asks the Narrator.\nThat depends on your purpose, doesn't it, he asks. And what was that purpose? We\nmight have a recap look at the premise and the generalization. With that in mind,\nperhaps, says the Narrator, you could have done some of these things.\nWe see on screen a bulletin board display.. .headed: \"What's Wrong with This\nPicture?\" It shows, let's say, a giraffe on a treeless plain.• .an elephant in ice-\ncovered mountains. • .a hairless chihuahua in Alaska, a \"husky\" in some tropical\ncountry., .a monkey in low river-brush country. • .a stag with many antlers in the jungle.•\na water It ly in the desert.• .a cactus in a swamp.. .an orchid by a frozen stream."
