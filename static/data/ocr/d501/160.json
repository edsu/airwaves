Since I understood that you*re now de¬\nvoting more, rather than less, time to problems of the aged I1a taking the liberty\nof sending you the attached outline.\nIt appears that funds may well be available for a few series in areas we recommend\nto the Educational Television and Radio Center. The ones I’m working on, and push¬\ning, are:\n1. Industrialization: i.e. American Democracy, under capitalism. This is visu¬\nalised as having considerable export value in explaining our dynamic system in\nways which people, now “taken* with Communism, might understand.\n2. Mental, Health: How much we really know about it, and how to establish and\nmaintain it; we can do things on radio here (preserving the anonymity of patients\netc.), which TV can’t do. This, like industrialization, w© don’t yet have really\nadequate outlines on.\n3*\nAll of these are in a sense functions of the others, and products and influence#\nrelated to the others, of course. Some package, isn’t it?\nWould you still be willing to work with us and the Center? And have you any quick\nadditions you can make, without my imposing too much on you, or your time? I’d\nappreciate a quick note, when you have a couple of minutes.\nAnd more power to you in your new job. Hay you prosper and find great satisfaction\nIn it.\nSincerely,\nHJS:jy\nEnclosure\nHarry J. Skornia\nExecutive Director"
