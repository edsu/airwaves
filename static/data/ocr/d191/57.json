Skornia\nPage 2\nSeptember 1, 1954\nI talked to Mr. Toogood in Chicago for a few minutes\non August 11, and he stressed the importance of cleanli¬\nness for proper operation of the machines. If at some\nfuture date the duplicating setup is moved, the duplica¬\ntors should be placed in a room separate from the room\nwhere tapes are wrapped, packed and unpacked. I believe\nthat we should have plastic covers made for the machines,\nand they should be covered at night or when the room is\nbeing swept. We should also have buildings and grounds\nkeep the window wells clean so that dust is not blown\nin from this source.\nThe following is a list of tubes to be replaced.\nThose in the duplicators check low but not so low that\nimmediate replacement is required.\nJohn Holt Magnecorder\n1-6SN7 - e\n1.31\n1-12SJ7- e\n1.12\nNew Duplicator\n1-5881 - A\n2.95\n1-6SL7 - a\n1.48\nOld Duplicator\n1-6SL7 - ®\n1.48\n1-12AT7- A\n1.62\nroc\nThe following lists tubes used and recommended spares.\nTubes Used\nPrice\nSpares\n5U4G-2\n.98\n2\n1.96\n5Y3-3\n.75\n2\n1.50\n6SL7GT-2\n1.48\n2\n2.96\n6SN7GT-1\n1.31\n1\n1.31\n6V6—7\n1.90\n4\n7.60\n6X4-1\n.84\n1\n.84\n12AT7-6\n1.62\n3\n4.86\n12AU7-3\n1.34\n2\n2.68\n12AX7-1\n1.40\n1\n1.40\n12SJ7-1\n1.12\n1\n1.12\n807-2\n2.40\n2\n4.80\n5879-5\n1.75\n3\n5.25\n5881-2\n35“\n2.95\n2\n5.90\ntnr.is\nWe should also have at the minimum one spare playback head\nand two recording heads.
