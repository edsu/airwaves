In the stories about his retirement, no one pointed up any\ncontrasts between Gino and his longtime rival, Fausto Coppi. This wasn«t necessary, for\nFausto is having both woman and financial trouble at the moment, and his contributions\nto the Air of Italy were getting quite as much newspaper space as the fact that Bartali\nhad racked up his bicycle.\nWell, I donft know whether you will consider any of these things important or not.\n3ut they are a part of what I have chosen to call \"L«r.ri* dfItalia,\" the air_ or the\natmosphere — of Italy at this moment. And I think you would agree, at least, that they\nhelp make Italy anything tut a dull place.\nGraham Hovey reporting. This Letter fro® Italy was recorded in Rome studios of\nRadiotelevisione Italians for the National Association of Educational Broadcasters _\nand this is the NABB Network.\nmw"
