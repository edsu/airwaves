It will be a pleasure to serve with you during what looks\nlike an important year for the Committee.\nYou will get a letter from Barsey telling about the radio inventory\nproject which will in all probability go to Harwood. I am sure we\nmembers of the committee approve such a project. I am wondering if\nSkornia checked with you about the Associations committment to this\nresearch venture, and where this large amount of funds came from.\nSincerely,\nIrving R. Merrill\nDirector of Television Research\nIRM/cdm"
