How long will it take us to\ncompile our reports?\nNine hundred dangerous man held in subjection by thirty men. It is\nincredible.\nIt is dreadful. Do you not feel the strain, the tension in the atmosphere j\nwork and silence, yes; but also fear, and a terrible sense of impending\ndisaster.\nHo disaster has ever taken place.\nTrue; but although the discipline is perfect, it rests on fragile foundations.\nIt is due to a tour de force, which is reborn unceasingly and renewed\nlaily, under penalty of compromising the whole system of discipline.\nCertainly I do not think this system would do in France.\nI bilieve not. The discipline established seems a very slippery ground\non wlich clever and firm men maintain themselves with skill and\nsuccess, but on which it might easily happen to them to fall.\nTo say tothing of the fact, that I am beginning to come to the conclusion\nthat this democracy is fundamentally grave and serious. To imitate a\nserious people would be very dangerous for a people whose nature is\napt to be lively and witty.\nThe seriousness is very true, Beaumont; but indeed I wonder whether it\nis ever wise for one people to imitate another, just as I wonder whether\nit is ever wise for one people to urge another to imitate them. This\nis same thing on which I feel very inconclusive."
