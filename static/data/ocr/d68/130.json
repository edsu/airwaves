  "text": "NOTES\nKit Number 2\nWORKING WITH THE TEACHER’S GUI DE\nAs a full partner in a teaching partnership, the classroom teacher\nwill want to know what his partner has planned, to make sure the mem¬\nbers of the team are working harmoniously toward goals which both un¬\nderstand and approve.\nThe TEACHER'S GUIDE will tell him. This is the basic information\ntool of the partnership. Some guides are more comprehensive than oth¬\ners, but from even the simplest of the Teacher\"s Guides the classroom\npartner learns where this lesson fits into the sequence of television\nlessons, the content area covered by the particular lesson, what the\nplanners intended the lesson to accomplish, and what they intended the\npupils to do as a result. Preferably, the Teacher's Guide will make\nclear the specific e lements of lesson content and the te levision teacher's\napproach to this material.\nIf this is a new topic or a complex subject, the classroom teacher\nwill want to know what new words may be introduced in the lesson on\nscreen, perhaps whatthe television teacher suggests about books to read,\nabout other resources, about related activities.\nIn his plans for utiSizing this television lesson, the classroom tea¬\ncher will certainly take into consideration these contributions from his\ncolleague. Depending upon his own situation and his own goals, he\nmay want to use some of the suggested activities before the lesson or af¬\nter it.\nC-13"
