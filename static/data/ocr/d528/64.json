Bookshester\nProgram Development\nUnited States National Student Association\n2115 \"S\" Street, Northwest\nWashington, D. C. 20008\nDear Mr. Bookshester:\nI am sorry to report, after reviewing your original\nproposal and considering the changes suggested in your\nletter of July 14, that the Corporation is unable to\nprovide funds for the creation of a National Communications\nCenter.\nWe are now working closely with Mr. Robert Mott of\nNAEB/NER/NERN in planning for the establishment of a program\nproduction facility in Washington to service all public\nradio stations. Once this center is established, it may be\npossible for the United States National Student Association\nto coordinate with this new organization, tentatively being\ncalled Nation Public Radio.\nWe are also hopeful that The Ford Foundation will assist\nin the activation of these national radio facilities.\nIf you have not done so, I wish to encourage you to\ncontact Miss Lillian Brown, Director of Broadcasting at The\nAmerican University in Washington, D. C. (Tel: 202-966-6506).\nIt is my understanding that she is very interested in developing\na student-produced and student-oriented program — national in\nconcept — for broadcast beginning in September. Cooperation\nmay be of value to both organizations.\n\\\n\\\nSincerely\nAl Hulsen\nDirector of Radio Projects\n/pb\ncc: Mr. Mott\ny\nMiss Brown\nMr. Davis"
