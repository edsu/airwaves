So, if you need support you reply and the\nBoard will back you up. I think all of your institutions should have such Boards\nwhom you will educate to your problems and whom you will respect and take guidance\nfrom.\nSmitht We’ve been playing around with such an idea as a bi-cameral arrange¬\nment. The house would represent the consumers and the senate would educate them\nand tell them what they should be consuming as a sort of check and balance.\nNoviks This is a good idea but make sure that all the groups in the community\nare on the council. I don’t see anything wrong with calling a meeting once a month\nand encouraging listeners to come with their complaints and try to educate them to\nyour problems.\nCrane; In connection with that, what do you think of pushing an audience or\nradio listening council—let that be the operation of the community itself?\nNovik: Just make sure you get all the groups in the community in on it and\nput them to work. You can’t have a program without telling the groups and ironing\nout their problems. You owe it to yourself and them to get their interest and coop¬\neration.\nWarren: Should we go beyond and get the top people of a field into the locale\nthrough TV when you can’t get them there in person, i.e. Baxter’s Shakespearean\nprogram?\nNovik: Do you know that the Center is for just this purpose? Dr. Skornia\nwill tell us more about this service later.\nWarren: The stress on the use of local personnel is important, yes, but I\ndon’t think ETV is justified unless it makes use of the very best.\nNovik: Dr. Warren is right and we should make a survey for the best in the\ncountry."
