And I must say that\nI am impressed all over again with the work that\nyou folks have done within the past few months.\nI thought this was an excellent statement,\nreally clarifying the role of educational radio\nin our multi-media society. Your statement\nand the magnificent study \"The Hidden Medium\",\nhave suggested to me a number of ways which we\nmay use educational radio if we can ever get\nour interconnecting plans beyond the talking\nstage.\nI appreciate the note that your Adminstrative\nAssistant sent me regarding my earlier letter.\nIt's quite evident ;that you've been very busy,\nand in a most effective way. Perhaps we'll have\na chance to get together at the Board Meeting in\nJune. Best regards.\nSincerely,\nHarry Durham, Director\nUniversity Communications\nCenter\nWHD/hm"
