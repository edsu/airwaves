This\nwould permit some of us to be home on Friday evening.\nYou may recall that at our meetings in Chicago we discussed\nthe possibility of having a meeting of the committee on\nSaturday. I believe that the question of the time of the\nmeeting was left open. You may have noticed in a recent\ncoramiinication from Harry Skornia that he plans to join the\nseminar on Thursday evening. Any consideration that you are\nable to give to holding meetings on Wednesday and Thursday will\nbe much appreciated.\nI look forward with great pleasure to seeing you again\nin Columbus.\nCordially,\nKenneth Harwood, Chairman\nDepartment of Telecommunications\nkh:mk\ncc: I. Keith Tyler\nHarry Skornia\nair mail"
