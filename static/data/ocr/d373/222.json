  "text": ".20-\na TV kind of paternalism. How long do you think, society can keep\nsaying: \"Look-but don't touch!?\nWe are talking about television and radio; and we are all of\nus tuned in. The Bible says that the child is father to the man.\nFreud said that what a man will be is determined by the time he is\nthree years old. And the latest statistics say that two-year olds\nspend about 20 hours per week watching television.\nWe--all of us--need the education that television and radio\ncan provide. Just as we want the people inside the ghetto to learn,\nthose of us outside of it have also got to be ready to learn. For\nthe many of us who have been emotionally raised in a world of\nV\nplatitudinous beliefs and verbal rationalizations it isn't going\n• t\nto be easy. But in realistic terms, for those who can't see it from\nany other point of view, I suspect that it beats having to choose\nbetween hiding out forever in the crab grass or .risking a hole in\nthe head to visit the art museum in the center of the city.\n• (I am not limiting these uses of TV and radio to the inner-\ncity black ghettos. It is urgent that we use communications similarly\nto serve the needs of the Spanish speaking ghettos in the cities, of\nthe barrios in the southwest, of the rural Mexican-American population,\nof the . . American Indians, of all the minority\ngroups that have been excluded from the mainstream of American society\nand have lost communication with it.)"
