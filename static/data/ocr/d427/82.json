  "text": "TO : NAE8 Officers, Regional Directors and Members of Membership Committee\n/;\nFROM: John W. Dunn 5/31/54\nT\nAs I recall, the present modus operandi for processing membership applications\ncame about as a result of some exceptionally long delays in notifying applicants\nas to whether or not they had been accepted for membership» Perhaps in our haste\nwe have been a little too speedy.\nIt has been apparent for some time that many of the applicants do not always give\nus much information about themselves. I have always tried to sum up as best I\ncan such information as has come in... .feeling in some instances that directors\nand committee members might not want to take time to read some rather voluminous\naccounts of the virtues and vices of the applicants.\nI agree heartily with Harry that something must be done to at least give some\nindication we*re interested in \"STANDARDS\". I believe it is perfectly in order\nfor all applications to be sent to the Regional Directors FIRST...that is to the\nregional director in whose region the applicant would be a part.\nNow this is o.k. IF the regional directors will REALLY do something about inves¬\ntigating the status of the applicant and giving us some pertinent information.\nBUi if the regional director will simply let the application lie on his desk or\neven get lost in the shuffle...then I would be against such a prodedure. It\nseems to be that the success of such a procedure then depends jcJNTIRELY on the\nindividual directors who would be contacted.\nAnd this investigation should not be just a perfunctory one. If additional\ninformation is required about applicants operation...then it should fall to the\nregional director to get such information as a supplement to the application.\nI am in favor of trying this method until the Fall Convention in dear Ole New\nYork."
