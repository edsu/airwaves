The research digests will point out, and attempt to\nexplain logically where possible, similarities and differences among\nthe various studies of the same problem. Cross references will be\nmade to past and concurrent studies.\nd* Approximate time schedule: It is anticipated that this will be an\non-going project extending over a three-year period. Limited efforts,\non an extremely limited budget and distribution basis, have already\nbeen made (see section VII below) by this Association. Therefore,\nthe full-scale assumption of this project should be accomplished in\nminimum time. Many research studies are already in hand and a concen¬\ntrated effort to obtain many more will be made as soon as money is\navailable to permit such an extensive undertaking. Analysis and digest"
