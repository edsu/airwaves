Com.\nIstanbul\nSPORT :\nLITTLE WORLD FOOTBALL CUP, BRAZIL 1972\nThe correct title of this event is \"The Brazil Independence\nCup\" and little more is known about it at present than the information\ncontained on pages 3 and U of the document supporting Item 1 of the\nAgenda (Decisions of the Administrative Council). The Bureau of the\nCommittee, when it considered this point in January, felt that the\nAdministrative Office should establish what interest this event was\nlikely to have for EBU member organizations and in consequence an\nenquiry on this point was sent out under reference letter 68.1*33\nof 15 February 1971. As these notes are drafted three organizations\nonly (BBC, RTB and SR) have expressed interest in principle but, as\nthey point out, this will depend on the exact dates of the Cup and\nthe teams taking part in it. The Administrative Office will watch\nover this matter and keep member organizations informed as the\nsituation develops.\nIn the meantime, however, it must be recorded that it\nseems very improbable that an EBU Operations Group will be required\nby EBU Television organizations and therefore if EBU Radio organiÂ¬\nzations who are interested wish some form of EBU action, it will\nbe necessary to agree on this independently of anything which their\nTelevision colleagues may be doing."
