  "text": "Dr. Oliver C. Carmichael’s resigna¬\ntion as president of the Carnegie Foun¬\ndation for the Advancement of Teach¬\ning, to become president of the Univer¬\nsity of Alabama next fall, means that\nNew York will be losing a highly use¬\nful citizen. The loss to the Foundation,\nwhich he has led since 1946 through\nnumerous studies and activities con¬\ntributing to educational advance, is\nevident. But beyond that Dr. Car¬\nmichael has been a constructive and\nenergetic force in many community\naffairs. He was a leading figure inj\nthe Owen D. Young commission that\nstudied the need for establishing a\nstate university in New York, and\nsince 1948 has been chairman of the\nboard of trustees of the university. He\nwill be leaving that post as well.\nA native son of Alabama and for\nsome years a college and university\npresident in Alabama and Tennessee,\nDr. Carmichael will be returning to the\ntask of strengthening still further the\nschool and university resources of the\nSouth, a movement that through recent\nyears has made much excellent prog¬\nress. The Carnegie Foundation has\nhad no small part in helping achieve\nthat progress. We shall miss his in¬\nspiring leadership here, but are grate¬\nful for having had him on loan from\nthe South for a few years."
